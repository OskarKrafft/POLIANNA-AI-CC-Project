# Time to Act: Tracing the Evolution of Sectoral Focus and Assigned Responsibilities in EU Climate Policy

Authors: Ray Hossain, Oskar Krafft, Johannes Müller

## Project Description

Climate change presents an existential challenge, requiring effective and adaptable policy frameworks. Yet, understanding how climate policies evolve over time, and which design elements are most effective, remains a complex challenge for policy makers. This project aims to trace and analyse changes in European Union (EU) climate policy design, focusing on two core dimensions: (1) the specificity of sectors targeted by policy measures, and (2) the identification of responsible actors or authorities.

Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we plan to analyse the text of climate policies. Our primary data source is the POLIANNA dataset, which provides annotated policy documents for rigorous, text-based analysis. We plan to explore traditional NLP approaches, such as entity recognition and sentence-level classification, and potentially extend the methodology to include large language model (LLM) techniques such as few-shot or one-shot approaches if traditional NLP methods do not yield satisfactory performance. These methods will help us compare policy content across time, detecting shifts in policy scope, and the actors charged with implementation. We aim to provide insights into the following research question: 

How does climate policy design in the EU change over time with respect to the specificity of sectors and the allocation of responsibility?

Our goal is to identify whether certain design features are correlated with more substantial emissions reductions or meaningful transformations in governance structures. Beyond academic relevance, these findings will benefit policymakers by highlighting successful design patterns and spotlighting areas in need of reform. The project will rely on publicly available datasets (e.g., POLIANNA and EUR-Lex), along with standard NLP libraries. Overall, the study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of climate policy evolution and offer actionable insights into designing more effective policies for mitigating climate change.
