That commitment has been reinforced with the adoption under the UNFCCC of the Glasgow Climate Pact on 13 November 2021, in which the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, recognises that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1,5 °C, compared with 2 °C, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C.</p>

It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. This transition affects workers from various sectors differently. At the same time, that transition has gender equality aspects as well as a particular impact on some disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as older people, persons with disabilities, persons with a minority racial or ethnic background and low and lower-middle income individuals and households. It also imposes greater challenges on certain regions, in particular structurally disadvantaged and peripheral regions, as well as on islands. It must therefore be ensured that the transition is just and inclusive, leaving no one behind.</p>

A robust monitoring, reporting and verification system is a prerequisite for any market-based measure, efficiency standard or other relevant measure, whether applied at Union level or globally. While carbon dioxide (CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span>) emissions represent the large majority of greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, methane (CH<span class="oj-sub">4</span>) and nitrous oxide (N<span class="oj-sub">2</span>O) emissions represent a relevant share of such emissions. The inclusion of CH<span class="oj-sub">4</span> and N<span class="oj-sub">2</span>O emissions in Regulation (EU) 2015/757 would be beneficial for environmental integrity and incentivising good practices, and should apply from 2024. General cargo ships below 5 000 gross tonnage but not below 400 gross tonnage represent a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions of all general cargo ships. To increase the environmental effectiveness of the monitoring, reporting and verification system, ensure a level-playing field and reduce the risk of circumvention, general cargo ships below 5 000 gross tonnage but not below 400 gross tonnage should be included in Regulation (EU) 2015/757 from 2025. Offshore ships emit a relevant share of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, that Regulation should also apply to offshore ships of 400 gross tonnage and above from 2025. The Commission should assess before 31 December 2024 whether additional ship types below 5 000 gross tonnage but not below 400 gross tonnage should be included in Regulation (EU) 2015/757.</p>
