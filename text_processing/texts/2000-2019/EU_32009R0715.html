The tasks of the ENTSO for Gas should be carried out in compliance with Community competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the ENTSO for Gas. The tasks of the ENTSO for Gas should be well-defined and its working method should ensure efficiency, transparency and the representative nature of the ENTSO for Gas. The network codes prepared by the ENTSO for Gas are not intended to replace the necessary national network codes for non cross-border issues. Given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level, transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure, whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with network codes and non-binding ten-year network development plans at Community level. Cooperation within such regional structures presupposes effective unbundling of network activities from production and supply activities. In the absence of such unbundling, regional cooperation between transmission system operators gives rise to a risk of anti-competitive conduct. Member States should promote cooperation and monitor the effectiveness of the network operations at regional level. Cooperation at regional level should be compatible with progress towards a competitive and efficient internal market in gas.</p>

The only way to do this is to give network users the freedom to book entry and exit capacity independently, thereby creating gas transport through zones instead of along contractual paths. The preference for entry-exit systems to facilitate the development of competition was already expressed by most stakeholders at the 6th Madrid Forum on 30 and 31 October 2002. Tariffs should not be dependent on the transport route. The tariff set for one or more entry points should therefore not be related to the tariff set for one or more exit points, and vice versa.</p>

Given the large proportion of existing contracts and the need to create a true level playing field between users of new and existing capacity, those principles should be applied to all contracted capacity, including existing contracts.</p>

The competent authorities should be given the competence to investigate effectively allegations of market abuse. To that end, it is necessary that competent authorities have access to data that provides information on operational decisions made by supply undertakings. In the gas market, all those decisions are communicated to the system operators in the form of capacity reservations, nominations and realised flows. System operators should keep information in relation thereto available to and easily accessible by the competent authorities for a fixed period of time. The competent authorities should, furthermore, regularly monitor the compliance of the transmission system operators with the rules.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">2.   Harmonised transport contracts and common network codes shall be designed in a manner that facilitates trading and re-utilisation of capacity contracted by network users without hampering capacity release.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">3.   Transmission system operators shall develop network codes and harmonised contracts following proper consultation with network users.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.   Transmission system operators shall implement standardised nomination and re-nomination procedures. They shall develop information systems and electronic communication means to provide adequate data to network users and to simplify transactions, such as nominations, capacity contracting and transfer of capacity rights between network users.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">5.   Transmission system operators shall harmonise formalised request procedures and response times according to best industry practice with the aim of minimising response times. They shall provide for online screen-based capacity booking and confirmation systems and nomination and re-nomination procedures no later than 1 July 2006 after consultation with the relevant network users.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">6.   Transmission system operators shall not separately charge network users for information requests and transactions associated with their transport contracts and which are carried out according to standard rules and procedures.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">7.   Information requests that require extraordinary or excessive expenses such as feasibility studies may be charged separately, provided the charges can be duly substantiated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">8.   Transmission system operators shall cooperate with other transmission system operators in coordinating the maintenance of their respective networks in order to minimise any disruption of transmission services to network users and transmission system operators in other areas and in order to ensure equal benefits with respect to security of supply including in relation to transit.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">9.   Transmission system operators shall publish at least annually, by a predetermined deadline, all planned maintenance periods that might affect network users' rights from transport contracts and corresponding operational information with adequate advance notice. This shall include publishing on a prompt and non-discriminatory basis any changes to planned maintenance periods and notification of unplanned maintenance, as soon as that information becomes available to the transmission system operator. During maintenance periods, transmission system operators shall publish regularly updated information on the details of and expected duration and effect of the maintenance.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">10.   Transmission system operators shall maintain and make available to the competent authority upon request a daily log of the actual maintenance and flow disruptions that have occurred. Information shall also be made available on request to those affected by any disruption.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">1.   Capacity-allocation mechanisms and congestion-management procedures shall facilitate the development of competition and liquid trading of capacity and shall be compatible with market mechanisms including spot markets and trading hubs. They shall be flexible and capable of adapting to evolving market circumstances.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">2.   Those mechanisms and procedures shall take into account the integrity of the system concerned as well as security of supply.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">3.   Those mechanisms and procedures shall neither hamper the entry of new market participants nor create undue barriers to market entry. They shall not prevent market participants, including new market entrants and companies with a small market share, from competing effectively.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.   Those mechanisms and procedures shall provide appropriate economic signals for efficient and maximum use of technical capacity and facilitate investment in new infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">5.   Network users shall be advised about the type of circumstance that could affect the availability of contracted capacity. Information on interruption should reflect the level of information available to the transmission system operator.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">6.   Should difficulties in meeting contractual delivery obligations arise due to system integrity reasons, transmission system operators should notify network users and seek a non-discriminatory solution without delay.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Transmission system operators shall consult network users regarding procedures prior to their implementation and agree them with the regulatory authority.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e150-50-1">2.2.   Congestion-management procedures in the event of contractual congestion</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">1.   In the event that contracted capacity goes unused, transmission system operators shall make that capacity available on the primary market on an interruptible basis via contracts of differing duration, as long as that capacity is not offered by the relevant network user on the secondary market at a reasonable price.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">2.   Revenues from released interruptible capacity shall be split according to rules laid down or approved by the relevant regulatory authority. Those rules shall be compatible with the requirement of an effective and efficient use of the system.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">3.   A reasonable price for released interruptible capacity may be determined by the relevant regulatory authorities taking into account the specific circumstances prevailing.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">4.   Where appropriate, transmission system operators shall make reasonable endeavours to offer at least parts of the unused capacity to the market as firm capacity.</p>
