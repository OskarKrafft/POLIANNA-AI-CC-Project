Implementing powers in respect of those aspects should therefore be delegated to the Commission. Technical rules on searching alerts should take into account the smooth operation of national applications. Subject to an impact assessment by the Commission, it should be decided to what extent the implementing measures could be the responsibility of the management authority, once it is set up.</p>
