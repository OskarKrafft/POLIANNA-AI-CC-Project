Organic production thus plays a dual societal role, where, on the one hand, it provides for a specific market responding to consumer demand for organic products and, on the other hand, it delivers publicly available goods that contribute to the protection of the environment and animal welfare, as well as to rural development.</p>

The results of that review carried out by the Commission show that the Union legal framework governing organic production should be improved to provide for rules that correspond to the high expectations of consumers and that guarantee sufficient clarity for those to whom they are addressed. Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 should be therefore repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.</p>

Primarily, it should cover products originating from agriculture, including aquaculture and beekeeping, as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Moreover, it should cover processed agricultural products for use as food or feed because the placing of such products on the market as organic products provides a major outlet for agricultural products and ensures that the organic nature of the agricultural products from which they are processed is visible to the consumer. Likewise, this Regulation should cover certain other products which are linked to agricultural products in a similarly close way as processed agricultural products for use as food and feed because those other products either constitute a major outlet for agricultural products or form an integral part of the production process. Finally, sea salt and other salts used for food and feed should be included in the scope of this Regulation because they may be produced by applying natural production techniques, and because their production contributes to the development of rural areas, and thus falls within the objectives of this Regulation. For reasons of clarity, such other products not listed in Annex I to the TFEU should be listed in an Annex to this Regulation.</p>

An agreement has been reached within the ordinary legislative procedure on 28 June 2017 that the organic production should be based on nourishing the plants primarily through the soil ecosystem and be soil-related, and that growing plants in demarcated beds should not be allowed anymore from that date. In order to give the operators who have developed such economic activity until that date the possibility to adapt, they should be allowed to maintain their production surfaces, if they were certified as organic under Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 before that date by their national authorities, for further 10 years after the date of application of this Regulation. On the basis of the information provided by Member States to the Commission, such activity had only been authorised in the Union before 28 June 2017 in Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The use of demarcated beds in organic agriculture should be subject to a report of the Commission which is to be published five years after the date of application of this Regulation.</p>

Furthermore, it is necessary to provide for the possibility for the Commission to contact directly the accreditation bodies and competent authorities in third countries to render the supervision of control authorities and control bodies respectively more efficient. In the case of products imported from third countries or the outermost regions of the Union with specific climatic and local conditions, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility for the Commission to grant specific authorisations for the use of products and substances in organic production.</p>

Furthermore, the multiplication of standards for control authorities and control bodies hampers adequate supervision by the Commission. Therefore, that scheme of recognition of equivalence should be abolished. However, those control authorities and control bodies should be given sufficient time so that they can prepare themselves to obtain recognition for the purposes of import of products that comply with Union rules. Furthermore, the new rules for the recognition of control authorities and control bodies for the purpose of importing compliant products should already apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, in order to allow the Commission to prepare for the recognition of such control authorities and control bodies from the date of application of this Regulation.</p>

Such separation measures shall be based on the natural situation, separate water distribution systems, distances, the tidal flow, and the upstream and the downstream location of the organic production unit. Algae and aquaculture production shall not be considered as organic when practiced at locations or in areas designated by Member State authorities as locations or areas which are unsuitable for such activities.</p>
