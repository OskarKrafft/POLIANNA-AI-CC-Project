<p>Directive 2002/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 9 December 2002</p><p>amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Following consultation of the Committee of the Regions,</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) The Auto oil II programme was aimed at identifying cost effective strategies to meet the air quality objectives of the Community. The Commission Communication Review on the Auto oil II programme concluded that there is a need for further measures, especially to address the issues of ozone and particulate emissions. Recent work on the development of national emissions ceilings has shown that further measures are needed to meet the air quality objectives decided upon in the Community legislation.</p><p>(2) Stringent standards on emissions from vehicles on highways have been gradually introduced. It has already been decided that those standards should be strengthened. The relative contribution of pollutants from non-road mobile machinery will thus be more predominant in the future.</p><p>(3) Directive 97/68/EC(4) introduced emission limit values for gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery.</p><p>(4) Although Directive 97/68/EC initially applied only to certain compression ignition engines, recital 5 of that Directive envisages the subsequent extension of its scope to include in particular gasoline engines.</p><p>(5) The emissions from small spark ignition engines (gasoline engines) in different types of machinery contribute significantly to identified air quality problems, both current and future, especially ozone formation.</p><p>(6) Emissions from small spark ignition engines are subject to strict environmental standards in the USA, showing that it is possible significantly to reduce the emissions.</p><p>(7) The absence of Community legislation means it is possible to place on the market engines with old fashioned technology from an environmental point of view, thereby jeopardising the air quality objectives in the Community, or to implement national legislation in this field, with the potential to create barriers to trade.</p><p>(8) Directive 97/68/EC is closely aligned with the corresponding US legislation, and continuing alignment will have benefits for industry, as well as for the environment.</p><p>(9) A certain lead time is necessary for the European industry, especially for those manufacturers that are not yet operating on a global basis, to be able to meet the emission standards.</p><p>(10) A two-step approach is used in Directive 97/68/EC for compression ignition engines as well as in the US regulations on spark ignition engines. Although it might have been possible to adopt a one-step approach in the Community legislation, this would have left the field unregulated for another four to five years.</p><p>(11) To achieve the necessary flexibility for worldwide alignment, a possible derogation, to be made under the comitology procedure, is included.</p><p>(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).</p><p>(13) Directive 97/68/EC should be amended accordingly,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>Directive 97/68/EC is hereby amended as follows:</p><p>1.

The temperature of the inner surface of the mixing chamber must be maintained above the dew point of the exhaust gases and a minimum temperature of 338 oK (65 °C) is recommended.</p><p>All components may optionally be measured directly in the dilution tunnel, or by sampling into a bag and subsequent measurement of the concentration in the sampling bag.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Appendix 2</p><p></p><p>1. CALIBRATION OF THE ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTS</p><p>1.1. Introduction</p><p>Each analyser shall be calibrated as often as necessary to fulfil the accuracy requirements of this standard. The calibration method that shall be used is described in this paragraph for the analysers indicated in Appendix 1, section 1.4.3.</p><p>1.2. Calibration gases</p><p>The shelf life of all calibration gases must be respected.</p><p>The expiry date of the calibration gases stated by the manufacturer shall be recorded.</p><p>1.2.1 Pure gases</p><p>The required purity of the gases is defined by the contamination limits given below. The following gases must be available for operation:</p><p>- purified nitrogen (contamination &amp;lt;= 1 ppm C, &amp;lt;= 1 ppm CO, &amp;lt;= 400 ppm CO2, &amp;lt;= 0,1 ppm NO),</p><p>- purified oxygen (purity  &amp;gt; 99,5 Vol.- % O2),</p><p>- hydrogen-helium mixture (40 ± 2 % hydrogen, balance helium); contamination &amp;lt;= 1 ppm C, &amp;lt;= 400 ppm CO2,</p><p>- purified synthetic air (contamination &amp;lt;= 1 ppm C, &amp;lt;= 1 ppm CO, &amp;lt;= 400 ppm CO2, &amp;lt;= 0,1 ppm NO (oxygen content between 18 % and 21 % vol).</p><p>1.2.2 Calibration and span gases</p><p>Mixture of gases having the following chemical compositions shall be available:</p><p>- C3H8 and purified synthetic air (see section 1.2.1),</p><p>- CO and purified nitrogen,</p><p>- and purified nitrogen (the amount of NO2 contained in this calibration gas must not exceed 5 % of the NO content),</p><p>- CO2 and purified nitrogen,</p><p>- CH4 and purified synthetic air,</p><p>- C2H6 and purified synthetic air.</p><p>Note:</p><p>Other gas combinations are allowed provided the gases do not react with one another.</p><p>The true concentration of a calibration and span gas shall be within ± 2 % of the nominal value. All concentrations of calibration gas shall be given on a volume basis (volume percent or volume ppm).</p><p>The gases used for calibration and span may also be obtained by means of precision blending devices (gas dividers), diluting with purified N2 or with purified synthetic air. The accuracy of the mixing device must be such that the concentration of the diluted calibration gases is accurate to within ± 1,5 %. This accuracy implies that primary gases used for blending must be known to an accuracy of at least ± 1 %, traceable to national or international gas standards. The verification shall be performed at between 15 % and 50 % of full scale for each calibration incorporating a blending device.</p><p>Optionally, the blending device may be checked with an instrument, which by nature is linear, e.g. using NO gas with a CLD. The span value of the instrument shall be adjusted with the span gas directly connected to the instrument. The blending device shall be checked at the used settings and the nominal value shall be compared to the measured concentration of the instrument. This difference shall in each point be within ± 0,5 % of the nominal value.</p><p>1.2.3 Oxygen interference check</p><p>Oxygen interference check gases shall contain propane with 350 ppm C ± 75 ppm C hydrocarbon.

The probe shall be disconnected from the exhaust system and the end plugged. The analyser pump shall be switched on. After an initial stabilisation period all flow meters should read zero. If not, the sampling lines shall be checked and the fault corrected.</p><p>The maximum allowable leakage rate on the vacuum side shall be 0,5 % of the in-use flow rate for the portion of the system being checked. The analyser flows and bypass flows may be used to estimate the in-use flow rates.</p><p>Alternatively, the system may be evacuated to a pressure of at least 20 kPa vacuum (80 kPa absolute). After an initial stabilisation period the pressure increase δp (kPa/min) in the system shall not exceed:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>Where:</p><p>Vsyst= system volume [l]</p><p>fr= system flow rate [l/min]</p><p>Another method is the introduction of a concentration step change at the beginning of the sampling line by switching from zero to span gas. If after an adequate period of time the reading shows a lower concentration compared to the introduced concentration, this points to calibration or leakage problems.</p><p>1.5. Calibration procedure</p><p>1.5.1 Instrument assembly</p><p>The instrument assembly shall be calibrated and calibration curves checked against standard gases. The same gas flow rates shall be used as when sampling exhaust gas.</p><p>1.5.2. Warming-up time</p><p>The warming-up time should be according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. If not specified, a minimum of two hours is recommended for warming-up the analysers.</p><p>1.5.3. NDIR and HFID analyser</p><p>The NDIR analyser shall be tuned, as necessary, and the combustion flame of the HFID analyser shall be optimised (section 1.9.1).</p><p>1.5.4. GC and HPCL</p><p>Both instruments shall be calibrated according to good laboratory practice and the recommendations of the manufacturer.</p><p>1.5.5. Establishment of the calibration curves</p><p>1.5.5.1. General guidelines</p><p>(a) Each normally used operating range shall be calibrated.</p><p>(b) Using purified synthetic air (or nitrogen), the CO, CO2, NOx and HC analysers shall be set at zero.</p><p>(c) The appropriate calibration gases shall be introduced to the analysers, the values recorded, and the calibration curves established.</p><p>(d) For all instrument ranges except for the lowest range, the calibration curve shall be established by at least 10 calibration points (excluding zero) equally spaced. For the lowest range of the instrument, the calibration curve shall be established by at least 10 calibration points (excluding zero) spaced so that half of the calibration points are placed below 15 % of the analyser&#039;s full scale and the rest are placed above 15 % of full scale. For all ranges the highest nominal concentration must be equal to or higher than 90 % of full scale.</p><p>(e) The calibration curve shall be calculated by the method of least squares. A best-fit linear or non-linear equation may be used.</p><p>(f) The calibration points must not differ from the least-squares best-fit line by more than ± 2 % of reading or ± 0,3 % of full scale whichever is larger.</p><p>(g) The zero setting shall be rechecked and the calibration procedure repeated, if necessary.</p><p>1.5.5.2. Alternative methods</p><p>If it can be shown that alternative technology (e.g. computer, electronically controlled range switch, etc.) can give equivalent accuracy, then these alternatives may be used.</p><p>1.6. Verification of the calibration</p><p>Each normally used operating range shall be checked prior to each analysis in accordance with the following procedure.</p><p>The calibration is checked by using a zero gas and a span gas whose nominal value is more than 80 % of full scale of the measuring range.</p><p>If, for the two points considered, the value found does not differ by more than ± 4 % of full scale from the declared reference value, the adjustment parameters may be modified. Should this not be the case, the span gas shall be verified or a new calibration curve shall be established in accordance with section 1.5.5.1.</p><p>1.7. Calibration of tracer gas analyser for exhaust flow measurement</p><p>The analyser for measurement of the tracer gas concentration shall be calibrated using the standard gas.</p><p>The calibration curve shall be established by at least 10 calibration points (excluding zero) spaced so that half of the calibration points are placed between 4 % to 20 % of the analyser&#039;s full scale and the rest are in between 20 % and 100 % of the full scale. The calibration curve shall be calculated by the method of least squares.</p><p>The calibration curve must not differ by more than ± 1 % of the full scale from the nominal value of each calibration point, in the range from 20 % to 100 % of the full scale. It also must not differ by more than ± 2 % of reading from the nominal value in the range from 4 % to 20 % of the full scale. The analyser shall be set at zero and spanned prior to the test run using a zero gas and a span gas whose nominal value is more than 80 % of the analyser full scale.</p><p>1.8. Efficiency test of the NOx converter</p><p>The efficiency of the converter used for the conversion of NO2 into NO is tested as given in sections 1.8.1 to 1.8.8 (figure 1 of Annex III, Appendix 2).</p><p>1.8.1. Test set-up</p><p>Using the test set-up as shown in figure 1 of Annex III and the procedure below, the efficiency of converters can be tested by means of an ozonator.</p><p>1.8.2. Calibration</p><p>The CLD and the HCLD shall be calibrated in the most common operating range following the manufacturer&#039;s specifications using zero and span gas (the NO content of which must amount to about 80 % of the operating range and the NO2 concentration of the gas mixture to less than 5 % of the NO concentration). The NOx analyser must be in the NO mode so that the span gas does not pass through the converter. The indicated concentration has to be recorded.</p><p>1.8.3. Calculation</p><p>The efficiency of the NOx, converter is calculated as follows:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>Where:</p><p>a= NOx concentration according to section 1.8.6</p><p>b= NOx concentration according to section 1.8.7</p><p>c= NO concentration according to section 1.8.4</p><p>d= NO concentration according to section 1.8.5.</p><p>1.8.4. Adding of oxygen</p><p>Via a T-fitting, oxygen or zero air is added continuously to the gas flow until the concentration indicated is about 20 % less than the indicated calibration concentration given in section 1.8.2. (The analyser is in the NO mode.)</p><p>The indicated concentration (c) shall be recorded. The ozonator is kept deactivated throughout the process.</p><p>1.8.5 Activation of the ozonator</p><p>The ozonator is now activated to generate enough ozone to bring the NO concentration down to about 20 % (minimum 10 %) of the calibration concentration given in section 1.8.2. The indicated concentration (d) shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NO mode.)</p><p>1.8.6 NOx mode</p><p>The NO analyser is then switched to the NOx mode so that the gas mixture (consisting of NO, NO2, O2 and N2) now passes through the converter. The indicated concentration (a) shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NOx mode.)</p><p>1.8.7. Deactivation of the ozonator</p><p>The ozonator is now deactivated. The mixture of gases described in section 1.8.6 passes through the converter into the detector. The indicated concentration (b) shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NOx mode.)</p><p>1.8.8. NO mode</p><p>Switched to NO mode with the ozonator deactivated, the flow of oxygen or synthetic air is also shut off. The NOx reading of the analyser shall not deviate by more than ± 5 % from the value measured according to section 1.8.2. (The analyser is in the NO mode.)</p><p>1.8.9. Test interval</p><p>The efficiency of the converter must be checked monthly.</p><p>1.8.10. Efficiency requirement</p><p>The efficiency of the converter shall not be less than 90 %, but a higher efficiency of 95 % is strongly recommended.</p><p>Note:</p><p>If, with the analyser in the most common range, the ozonator cannot give a reduction from 80 % to 20 % according to section 1.8.5, then the highest range which will give the reduction shall be used.</p><p>1.9. Adjustment of the FID</p><p>1.9.1. Optimisation of the detector response</p><p>The HFID must be adjusted as specified by the instrument manufacturer. A propane in air span gas should be used to optimise the response on the most common operating range.</p><p>With the fuel and airflow rates set at the manufacturer&#039;s recommendations, a 350 ± 75 ppm C span gas shall be introduced to the analyser. The response at a given fuel flow shall be determined from the difference between the span gas response and the zero gas response. The fuel flow shall be incrementally adjusted above and below the manufacturer&#039;s specification. The span and zero response at these fuel flows shall be recorded. The difference between the span and zero response shall be plotted and the fuel flow adjusted to the rich side of the curve. This is the initial flow rate setting, which may need further optimisation depending on the results of the hydrocarbon response factor and the oxygen interference check according to sections 1.9.2 and 1.9.3.</p><p>If the oxygen interference or the hydrocarbon response factors do not meet the following specifications, the airflow shall be incrementally adjusted above and below the manufacturer&#039;s specifications, sections 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 should be repeated for each flow.</p><p>1.9.2. Hydrocarbon response factors</p><p>The analyser shall be calibrated using propane in air and purified synthetic air, according to section 1.5.</p><p>Response factors shall be determined when introducing an analyser into service and after major service intervals. The response factor (Rf) for a particular hydrocarbon species is the ratio of the FID C1 reading to the gas concentration in the cylinder expressed by ppm C1.</p><p>The concentration of the test gas must be at a level to give a response of approximately 80 % of full scale. The concentration must be known to an accuracy of ± 2 % in reference to a gravimetric standard expressed in volume. In addition, the gas cylinder must be preconditioned for 24 hours at a temperature of 298 K (25 °C) ± 5 K.</p><p>The test gases to be used and the recommended relative response factor ranges are as follows:</p><p>- methane and purified synthetic air: 1,00 &amp;lt;= Rf &amp;lt;= 1,15</p><p>- propylene and purified synthetic air: 0,90 &amp;lt;= Rf &amp;lt;= 1,1</p><p>- toluene and purified synthetic air: 0,90 &amp;lt;= Rf &amp;lt;= 1,10.</p><p>These values are relative to the response factor (Rf) of 1,00 for propane and purified synthetic air.</p><p>1.9.3. Oxygen interference check</p><p>The oxygen interference check shall be determined when introducing an analyser into service and after major service intervals. A range shall be chosen where the oxygen interference check gases will fall in the upper 50 %. The test shall be conducted with the oven temperature set as required. The oxygen interference gases are specified in section 1.2.3.</p><p>(a) The analyser shall be zeroed.</p><p>(b) The analyser shall be spanned with the 0 % oxygen blend for gasoline fuelled engines.</p><p>(c) The zero response shall be rechecked. If it has changed more than 0,5 % of full scale subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be repeated.</p><p>(d) The 5 % and 10 % oxygen interference check gases shall be introduced.</p><p>(e) The zero response shall be rechecked. If it has changed more than ± 1 % of full scale, the test shall be repeated.</p><p>(f) The oxygen interference ( % O2I) shall be calculated for each mixture in step (d) as follows:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>where:</p><p>A= hydrocarbon concentration (ppm C) of the span gas used in subsection (b)</p><p>B= hydrocarbon concentration (ppm C) of the oxygen interference check gases used in subsection (d)</p><p>C= analyser response</p><p>D= percent of full scale analyser response due to A</p><p>(g) The % of oxygen interference ( % O2I) shall be less than ± 3 % for all required oxygen interference check gases prior to testing.</p><p>(h) If the oxygen interference is greater than ± 3 %, the air flow above and below the manufacturer&#039;s specifications shall be incrementally adjusted, repeating section 1.9.1 for each flow.</p><p>(i) If the oxygen interference is greater than ± 3 %, after adjusting the air flow, the fuel flow and thereafter the sample flow shall be varied, repeating section 1.9.1 for each new setting.</p><p>(j) If the oxygen interference is still greater than ± 3 %, the analyser, FID fuel, or burner air shall be repaired or replaced prior to testing. This section shall then be repeated with the repaired or replaced equipment or gases.</p><p>1.10. Interference effects with CO, CO2, NOX and O2 analysers</p><p>Gases other than the one being analysed can interfere with the reading in several ways. Positive interference occurs in NDIR and PMD instruments where the interfering gas gives the same effect as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering gas broadening the absorption band of the measured gas, and in CLD instruments by the interfering gas quenching the radiation. The interference checks in sections 1.10.1 and 1.10.2 shall be performed prior to an analyser&#039;s initial use and after major service intervals, but at least once per year.</p><p>1.10.1. CO analyser interference check</p><p>Water and CO2 can interfere with the CO analyser performance. Therefore a CO2 span gas having a concentration of 80 % to 100 % of full scale of the maximum operating range used during testing shall be bubbled through water at room temperature and the analyser response recorded. The analyser response must not be more than 1 % of full scale for ranges equal to or above 300 ppm or more than 3 ppm for ranges below 300 ppm.</p><p>1.10.2. NOx analyser quench checks</p><p>The two gases of concern for CLD (and HCLD) analysers are CO2 and water vapour. Quench responses of these gases are proportional to their concentrations, and therefore require test techniques to determine the quench at the highest expected concentrations experienced during testing.</p><p>1.10.2.1. CO2 quench check</p><p>A CO2 span gas having a concentration of 80 % to 100 % of full scale of the maximum operating range shall be passed through the NDIR analyser and the CO2 value recorded as A. It shall then be diluted approximately 50 % with NO span gas and passed through the NDIR and (H)CLD with the CO2 and NO values recorded as B and C, respectively. The CO2 shall be shut off and only the NO span gas is passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as D.</p><p>The quench, which shall not be greater than 3 % full scale, shall be calculated as follows:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>where:</p><p>A: undiluted CO2 concentration measured with NDIR %</p><p>B: diluted CO2 concentration measured with NDIR %</p><p>C: diluted NO concentration measured with CLD ppm</p><p>D: undiluted NO concentration measured with CLD ppm</p><p>Alternative methods of diluting and quantifying CO2 and NO span gas values, such as dynamic/mixing/blending, can be used.</p><p>1.10.2.2. Water quench check</p><p>This check applies to wet gas concentration measurements only. Calculation of water quench must consider dilution of the NO span gas with water vapour and scaling of water vapour concentration of the mixture to that expected during testing.</p><p>A NO span gas having a concentration of 80 % to 100 % of full scale to the normal operating range shall be passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as D. The NO span gas shall then be bubbled through water at room temperature and passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as C. The water temperature shall be determined and recorded as F. The mixture&#039;s saturation vapour pressure that corresponds to the bubbler water temperature (F) shall be determined and recorded as G. The water vapour concentration (in %) of the mixture shall be calculated as follows:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>and recorded as H. The expected diluted NO span gas (in water vapour) concentration shall be calculated as follows:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>and recorded as De.</p><p>The water quench shall not be greater than 3 % and shall be calculated as follows:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>where:</p><p>De: expected diluted NO concentration (ppm)</p><p>C: diluted NO concentration (ppm)</p><p>Hm: maximum water vapour concentration</p><p>H: actual water vapour concentration (%).</p><p>Note:</p><p>It is important that the NO span gas contains minimal NO2 concentration for this check, since absorption of NO2 in water has not been accounted for in the quench calculations.</p><p>1.10.3. O2 analyser interference</p><p>Instrument response of a PMD analyser caused by gases other than oxygen is comparatively slight. The oxygen equivalents of the common exhaust gas constituents are shown in table 1.</p><p>Tabel 1 - Oxygen equivalents</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>The observed oxygen concentration shall be corrected by the following formula if high precision measurements are to be done:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>1.11. Calibration intervals</p><p>The analysers shall be calibrated according to section 1.5 at least every three months or whenever a system repair or change is made that could influence calibration.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Appendix 3</p><p></p><p>1. DATA EVALUATION AND CALCULATIONS</p><p>1.1. Gaseous emissions evaluation</p><p>For the evaluation of the gaseous emissions, the chart reading for a minimum of the last 120 s of each mode shall be averaged, and the average concentrations (conc) of HC, CO, NOx and CO2 during each mode shall be determined from the average chart readings and the corresponding calibration data. A different type of recording can be used if it ensures an equivalent data acquisition.</p><p>The average background concentration (concd) may be determined from the bag readings of the dilution air or from the continuous (non-bag) background reading and the corresponding calibration data.</p><p>1.2.

The formula takes into account not only the hydrogen to carbon ratio and the oxygen to carbon ratio but also other possible fuel components such as sulphur and nitrogen. However, as the SI. engines of the Directive are tested with a petrol (quoted as a reference fuel in Annex V) containing usually only carbon and hydrogen, the simplified formula is considered.</p><p>(3) In the case of NOx the concentration has to be multiplied by the humidity correction factor KH (humidity correction factor for NOx).</p><p>Appendix 4</p><p></p><p>1. COMPLIANCE WITH EMISSION STANDARDS</p><p>This Appendix shall apply to SI engines stage 2 only.</p><p>1.1. The exhaust emission standards for stage 2 engines in Annex I (4.2) apply to the emissions of the engines for their emission durability period EDP as determined in accordance with this Appendix.</p><p>1.2. For all stage 2 engines, if, when properly tested according to the procedures in this Directive, all test engines representing an engine family have emissions which, when adjusted by multiplication by the deterioration factor (DF) laid down in this Appendix, are less than or equal to each stage 2 emission standard (family emission limit (FEL), where applicable) for a given engine class, that family shall be considered to comply with the emission standards for that engine class. If any test engine representing an engine family has emissions which, when adjusted by multiplication by the deterioration factor laid down in this Appendix, are greater than any single emission standard (FEL, where applicable) for a given engine class, that family shall be considered not to comply with the emission standards for that engine class.</p><p>1.3. Small volume engine manufacturers may, optionally, take deterioration factors for HC+NOx and CO from table 1 or 2 in this section, or they may calculate deterioration factors for HC+NOx and CO according to the process described in section 1.3.1. For technologies not covered by tables 1 and 2 in this section, the manufacturer must use the process described in section 1.4 in this Appendix.</p><p>Table 1: Hand-held engine HC+NOx and CO assigned deterioration factors for small volume manufacturer</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>Table 2: Non-hand-held engine HC+NOx and CO assigned deterioration factors for small volume manufacturers</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>1.3.1. Formula for calculating deterioration factors for engines with after treatment:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>where:</p><p>DF= deterioration factor</p><p>NE= new engine emission levels prior to the catalyst (g/kWh)</p><p>EDF= deterioration factor for engines without catalyst as shown in table 1</p><p>CC= amount converted at 0 hours in g/kWh</p><p>F= 0,8 for HC and 0,0 for NOx for all classes of engines</p><p>F= 0,8 for CO for all classes of engines</p><p>1.4. Manufacturers shall obtain an assigned DF or calculate a DF, as appropriate, for each regulated pollutant for all stage 2 engine families. Such DFs shall be used for type approval and production line testing.</p><p>1.4.1. For engines not using assigned DFs from tables 1 or 2 of this section, DFs shall be determined as follows:</p><p>1.4.1.1. On at least one test engine representing the configuration chosen to be the most likely to exceed HC + NOx emission standards, (FELs where applicable), and constructed to be representative of production engines, conduct (full) test procedure emission testing as described in this Directive after the number of hours representing stabilised emissions.</p><p>1.4.1.2 If more than one engine is tested, average the results and round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard, expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p>1.4.1.3 Conduct such emission testing again following ageing of the engine. The ageing procedure should be designed to allow the manufacturer to appropriately predict the in-use emission deterioration expected over the durability period of the engine, taking into account the type of wear and other deterioration mechanisms expected under typical consumer use which could affect emissions performance. If more than one engine is tested, average the results and round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard, expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p>1.4.1.4. Divide the emissions at the end of the durability period (average emissions, if applicable) for each regulated pollutant by the stabilised emissions (average emissions, if applicable) and round to two significant figures. The resulting number shall be the DF, unless it is less than 1,00, in which case the DF shall be 1,0.</p><p>1.4.1.5. At the manufacturer&#039;s option additional emission test points can be scheduled between the stabilised emission test point and the emission durability period. If intermediate tests are scheduled, the test points must be evenly spaced over the EDP (plus or minus two hours) and one such test point shall be at one half of full EDP (plus or minus two hours).</p><p>For each pollutant HC + NOx and CO, a straight line must be fitted to the data points treating the initial test as occurring at hour zero, and using the method of least-squares. The deterioration factor is the calculated emissions at the end of the durability period divided by the calculated emissions at zero hours.</p><p>1.4.1.6. Calculated deterioration factors may cover families in addition to the one on which they were generated if the manufacturer submits a justification acceptable to the national type approval authority in advance of type approval that the affected engine families can be reasonably expected to have similar emission deterioration characteristic based on the design and technology used.</p><p>A non-exclusive list of design and technology groupings is given below:</p><p>- conventional two-stroke engines without after treatment system,</p><p>- conventional two-stroke engines with a ceramic catalyst of the same active material and loading, and the same number of cells per cm2,</p><p>- conventional two-stroke engines with a metallic catalyst of the same active material and loading, same substrate and the same number of cells per cm2,</p><p>- two-stroke engines provided with a stratified scavenging system,</p><p>- four-stroke engines with catalyst (defined as above) with same valve technology and identical lubrication system,</p><p>- four-stroke engines without catalyst with the same valve technology and identical lubrication system.</p><p>2. EMISSION DURABILITY PERIODS FOR STAGE 2 ENGINES</p><p>2.1. Manufacturers shall declare the applicable EDP category for each engine family at the time of type approval. Such category shall be the category which most closely approximates the expected useful lives of the equipment into which the engines are expected to be installed as determined by the engine manufacturer. Manufacturers shall retain data appropriate to support their choice of EDP category for each engine family. Such data shall be supplied to the approval authority upon request.</p><p>2.1.1. For hand-held engines: manufacturers shall select an EDP category from table 1.</p><p>Table 1: EDP categories for hand-held engines (hours)</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>2.1.2. For non-hand-held engines: manufacturers shall select an EDP category from table 2.</p><p>Table 2: EDP categories for non-hand-held engines (hours)</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>2.1.3. The manufacturer must satisfy the approval authority that the declared useful life is appropriate. Data to support a manufacturer&#039;s choice of EDP category, for a given engine family, may include but are not limited to:</p><p>- surveys of the life spans of the equipment in which the subject engines are installed,</p><p>- engineering evaluations of field aged engines to ascertain when engine performance deteriorates to the point where usefulness and/or reliability is impacted to a degree sufficient to necessitate overhaul or replacement,</p><p>- warranty statements and warranty periods,</p><p>- marketing materials regarding engine life,</p><p>- failure reports from engine customers, and</p><p>- engineering evaluations of the durability, in hours, of specific engine technologies, engine materials or engine designs.&quot;</p><p>5.

In establishment of their limit values the terms of ISO 4259 &quot;Petroleum products - Determination and application of precision data in relation to methods of test&quot; have been applied and in fixing a minimum value, a minimum difference of 2R above zero has been taken into account; in fixing a maximum and minimum value, the minimum difference is 4R (R = reproducibility). Notwithstanding this measure, which is necessary for statistical reasons, the manufacturer of fuels should nevertheless aim at a zero value where the stipulated maximum value is 2R and at the mean value in the case of quotations of maximum and minimum limits. Should it be necessary to clarify the question as to whether a fuel meets the requirements of the specifications, the terms of ISO 4259 should be applied.</p><p>Note 2:</p><p>The fuel may contain oxidation inhibitors and metal deactivators normally used to stabilise refinery gasoline streams, but detergent/dispersive additives and solvent oils must not be added.</p><p>6.
