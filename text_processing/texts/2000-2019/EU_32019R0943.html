Historically, the electricity system was dominated by vertically integrated, often publicly owned, monopolies with large centralised nuclear or fossil fuel power plants. The internal market for electricity, which has been progressively implemented since 1999, aims to deliver a real choice for all consumers in the Union new business opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability. The internal market for electricity has increased competition, in particular at the wholesale level, and cross-zonal trade. It remains the foundation of an efficient energy market.</p>

In the future, customers need to be enabled to fully participate in the market on equal footing with other market participants and need to be empowered to manage their energy consumption. To integrate the growing share of renewable energy, the future electricity system should make use of all available sources of flexibility, particularly demand side solutions and energy storage, and should make use of digitalisation through the integration of innovative technologies with the electricity system. To achieve effective decarbonisation at the lowest cost, the future electricity system also needs to encourage energy efficiency. The completion of the internal energy market through the effective integration of renewable energy can drive investments in the long term and can contribute to delivering the objectives of the Energy Union and the 2030 climate and energy framework, as set out in the Commission communication of 22 January 2014 entitled ‘A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030’, and endorsed in the conclusions adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 23 and 24 October 2014.</p>

In that regard, Title IV of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 establishes three methodologies through which transmission system operators are entitled to allocate cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity and the sharing of reserves, when supported on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis: the co-optimisation process, the market-based allocation process and the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis. The co-optimisation allocation process is to be performed on a day-ahead basis. By contrast, it is possible to perform the market-based allocation process where the contracting is carried out not more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity and to perform the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis where the contracting is done more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity, provided that the volumes allocated are limited and that an assessment is carried out annually. Once a methodology for the process of allocating cross-zonal capacity is approved by the relevant regulatory authorities, early application of that methodology by two or more transmission system operators could take place to allow them to gain experience and to allow for the smooth application of that methodology by more transmission system operators in the future. The application of such methodologies should nevertheless be harmonised by all transmission system operators in order to foster market integration.</p>

To make balancing markets and the overall energy system fit for the integration of the increasing share of variable renewable energy, imbalance prices should reflect the real-time value of energy. All market participants should be financially responsible for the imbalances they cause in the system, representing the difference between the allocated volume and the final position in the market. For demand response aggregators, the allocated volume consists of the volume of energy physically activated by the participating customers' load, based on a defined measurement and baseline methodology.</p>

The relevant transmission system operator and the competent regulatory authority should give the neighbouring transmission system operators prior notice of the review and the results of the review should be published. It should be possible to launch a regional bidding zone review following the technical report on congestion in line with Article 14 of this Regulation or in accordance with existing procedures laid down in Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Short-term markets improve liquidity and competition by enabling more resources to participate fully in the market, especially those resources that are more flexible. Effective scarcity pricing will encourage market participants to react to market signals and to be available when the market most needs them and ensures that they can recover their costs in the wholesale market. It is therefore critical to ensure that administrative and implicit price caps are removed in order to allow for scarcity pricing. When fully embedded in the market structure, short-term markets and scarcity pricing contribute to the removal of other market distortive measures, such as capacity mechanisms, in order to ensure security of supply. At the same time, scarcity pricing without price caps on the wholesale market should not jeopardize the possibility of offering reliable and stable prices to final customers, in particular household customers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industrial customers.</p>

The maximum level of capacity of interconnectors and the critical network elements should therefore be made available, complying with the safety standards of secure network operation including respecting the security standard for contingencies (N-1). However, there are some limitations to setting the capacity level in a meshed grid. Clear minimum levels of available capacity for cross-zonal trade need to be put in place in order to reduce the effects of loop flows and internal congestions on cross-zonal trade and to give a predictable capacity value for market participants. Where the flow-based approach is used, that minimum capacity should determine the minimum share of the capacity of a cross-zonal or an internal critical network element respecting operational security limits to be used as an input for coordinated capacity calculation under Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, taking into account contingencies. The total remaining share of capacity may be used for reliability margins, loop flows and internal flows. Furthermore, in the case of foreseeable problems for ensuring grid security, derogations should be possible for a limited transitional phase. Such derogations should be accompanied by a methodology and projects providing for a long-term solution.</p>

Member States should be able to choose between a reconfiguration of their bidding zone or measures such as grid reinforcement and grid optimisation. The starting point for such a decision should be the identification of long-term structural congestions by the transmission system operator or operators of a Member State, by a report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (the ‘ENTSO for Electricity’) on congestion or by a bidding zone review. Member States should first try to find a common solution on how to best address congestion. In the course of doing so Member States might adopt multinational or national action plans to address congestion. For Member States which adopt an action plan to address congestion, a phase-in period in the form of a linear trajectory for the opening of interconnectors should apply. At the end of the implementation of such an action plan, Member States should have a possibility to choose whether to opt for a reconfiguration of the bidding zone(s) or whether to opt for addressing remaining congestion through remedial actions for which they bear the costs. In the latter case their bidding zone should not be reconfigured against the will of that Member State, provided that the minimum capacity is reached. The minimum level of capacity that should be used in coordinated capacity calculation should be a percentage of the capacity of a critical network element, as defined following the selection process under Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, after, or, in the case of a flow-based approach, while, respecting the operational security limits in contingency situations. A Commission decision on the configuration of a bidding zone should be possible as a measure of last resort and should only amend the configuration of a bidding zone in those Member States which have opted to split the bidding zone or which have not reached the minimum level of the capacity.</p>

For that reason, it is necessary to ensure that the coordination of transmission system operators through regional coordination centres takes place across the Union. Where transmission system operators of a given region are not yet coordinated by an existing or a planned regional coordination centre, the transmission system operators in that region should establish or designate a regional coordination centre.</p>
