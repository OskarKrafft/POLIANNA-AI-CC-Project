However, there is a possibility of distorting competition or hampering the overall efficiency of the Union aviation network through the inefficient use of existing capacity. Since the achievement of the specific noise abatement objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of harmonised rules on the process for introducing operating restrictions as part of the noise management process, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. Such a harmonised method does not impose noise quality objectives, which continue to derive from Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc6-L_2014173EN.01006501-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_2014173EN.01006501-E0006"

Such information is currently provided and managed at the level of individual airports. Those data need to be placed at the disposal of aircraft operators and airports for operational purposes. It is important to use the databank of the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘the Agency’) concerning noise performance certification as a validation tool with the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) data on individual flights. Such data are currently already systematically requested for central flow management purposes, but are not at present available to the Commission or to the Agency, and need to be specified for the purpose of this Regulation and for performance regulation of air traffic management. Good access to validated modelling data, determined in accordance with internationally recognised processes and best practices, should improve the quality of mapping of noise contours of individual airports to support policy decisions.</p>
