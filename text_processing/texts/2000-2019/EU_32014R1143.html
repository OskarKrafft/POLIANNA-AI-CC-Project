A list of such invasive alien species considered to be of Union concern ("the Union list") should therefore be established and regularly updated. An invasive alien species should be considered to be of Union concern if the damage that it causes in affected Member States is so significant that it justifies the adoption of dedicated measures applicable across the Union, including in the Member States that are not yet affected or are even unlikely to be affected. To ensure that the identification of invasive alien species of Union concern remains proportionate, the Union list should be established and updated gradually and be focused on species whose inclusion on the Union list would effectively prevent, minimise or mitigate the adverse impact of those species in a cost efficient manner. As species within the same taxonomic group often have similar ecological requirements and may pose similar risks, the inclusion of taxonomic groups of species on the Union list should be allowed, where appropriate.</p>

Member States should therefore be granted the possibility to adopt certain emergency measures on the basis of available scientific evidence. Such emergency measures would allow immediate reaction against invasive alien species which could pose risks related to their introduction, establishment and spread in those countries, while Member States assess the actual risks posed by them, in line with the applicable provisions of the relevant Agreements of the WTO, in particular with a view to having those species recognised as invasive alien species of Union concern. There is a need to couple national emergency measures with the possibility of adopting emergency measures at Union level to comply with the provisions of the relevant Agreements of the WTO. Furthermore, emergency measures at Union level would equip the Union with a mechanism to act swiftly in case of presence or imminent danger of entry of a new invasive alien species in accordance with the precautionary principle.</p>

Action should include voluntary measures, such as the actions proposed by the International Maritime Organisation's Guidelines for the Control and Management of Ships' Biofouling, and mandatory measures. Action should build on the experience gained in the Union and in Member States in managing certain pathways, including measures established through the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments adopted in 2004.

Surveillance systems should imply paying continuous attention to any new invasive alien species anywhere in the Union and aim to provide an effective and complete picture at Union level.
