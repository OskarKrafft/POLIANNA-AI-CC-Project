By implementing this Regulation, the implementation of the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children at Union as well as at Member State level should be financially supported, in particular as regards Safer Internet Centres (SICs) in the Member States. Activities of SICs, including awareness nodes and other awareness-raising activities, helplines for children, parents and carers on the best means for children to use the Internet, as well as hotlines for reporting child sexual abuse content on the Internet, are a key element and prerequisite for the success of that strategy.</p>

It also establishes the breakdown of the resources to be available under Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 in all three sectors. Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 is applicable from 1 January 2014. It is thus appropriate to align the application of this Regulation with the application of Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 and with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013.

            <p class="oj-normal">Interventions in the area of digital service infrastructure generally rely on a two-layer architecture approach: core service platforms and generic services. The core service platform is a pre-condition for establishing a digital service infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The core service platforms address the interoperability and security needs of projects of common interest. They are intended to enable digital interactions between public authorities and citizens, between public authorities and businesses and organisations, or between public authorities of different Member States through standardised, cross-border, and user-friendly interaction platforms.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Building block digital service infrastructures take priority over other digital service infrastructures, since the former are a pre-condition for the latter. The generic services provide the connection to the core service platforms and enable the national added value services to use the core service platforms. They provide gateways between national services and core service platforms and allow national public authorities and organisations, businesses and/or citizens to access the core service platform for their cross-border transactions. The quality of the services and the support for stakeholders involved in cross-border transactions must be ensured. They must support and stimulate the take-up of core service platforms.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The focus must not be entirely on the creation of digital service infrastructures and related services but also on the governance relating to the operation of such platforms.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">New core service platforms must mainly be based on existing platforms and their building blocks and/or, when possible, must add new building blocks.</p>
