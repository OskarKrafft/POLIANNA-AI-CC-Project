To that end, the Security Accreditation Board and the Agency staff under its control should carry out their work in a manner ensuring their autonomy and independence with regard to the Agency’s other activities. A tangible and effective structural division should be set up within the Agency between its various activities by 1 January 2014.

There should never be any legitimate reason to suspect that decisions might be influenced by interests conflicting with the role of the Agency as a body serving the Union as a whole or by the private interests or affiliations of any member of the Agency staff, any seconded national expert or observer, or of any member of the Administrative Board or the Security Accreditation Board, which would create, or have the potential to create, a conflict with the proper performance of the official duties of the person concerned. The Administrative Board and the Security Accreditation Board should therefore adopt comprehensive rules on conflicts of interest that cover the entire Agency. Those rules should take account of the recommendations issued by the Court of Auditors in its Special Report No 15 of 2012 which was prepared at the request of the European Parliament, and of the need to avoid conflicts of interest between the Members of the Administrative Board and of the Security Accreditation Board.</p>

In order to ensure the smooth running of the programmes, the multiannual and the annual work programmes and the annual report should be as detailed as possible. As a consequence, they might contain material that is sensitive from the point of view of security or contractual relations. It would therefore be appropriate to publish only an executive summary of those documents. In the interests of transparency, those summaries should nevertheless be as complete as possible.</p>
