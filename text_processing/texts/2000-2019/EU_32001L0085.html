<p>Directive 2001/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 20 November 2001</p><p>relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver&#039;s seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 25 June 2001,</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured. It is important to adopt measures to that end.</p><p>(2) The technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver&#039;s seat.</p><p>(3) Those requirements differ from one Member State to another.</p><p>(4) Owing to differences in technical prescriptions, these vehicles have been prevented from being put on to the Community market. The adoption of harmonised requirements by all of the Member States in place of their national regulations should facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market for these vehicles.</p><p>(5) It is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to, or in place of, their existing rules in order, in particular, to allow the EC type-approval procedure which is the subject of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4) to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle.</p><p>(6) This Directive is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure, which was established by Directive 70/156/EEC.</p><p>(7) To acknowledge advances already made in order to improve accessibility for persons of reduced mobility to vehicles of Classes I and II, existing types of vehicle should be permitted to have a steeper slope in parts of the gangway than new types of vehicle.</p><p>(8) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the avoidance of barriers to trade within the Community through the application of EC vehicle type-approval for such vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States on account of the scale and impact of the action proposed in the sector in question, and can therefore be better attained at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p><p>(9) In order to distinguish between existing and new types of vehicle, it is necessary to refer to Council Directive 76/756/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles and their trailers(5).</p><p>(10) It is desirable to take account of the existing technical requirements adopted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) in its Regulation No 36 (&quot;Uniform Provisions concerning the Approval of Large Passenger Vehicles with regard to their General Construction&quot;), its Regulation No 52 (&quot;Uniform Provisions concerning the Construction of Small-Capacity Public Service Vehicles&quot;), its Regulation No 66 (&quot;Uniform Provisions Concerning the Approval of Large Passenger Vehicles with regard to the Strength of their Superstructure&quot;) and its Regulation No 107 (&quot;Uniform Provisions concerning the Approval of Double-Deck Large Passenger Vehicles with regard to their General Construction&quot;), which are annexed to the Agreement of 20 March 1958 concerning the adoption of uniform conditions for approval and reciprocal recognition of approval for motor vehicle equipment and parts.</p><p>(11) While the principal aim of this Directive is to guarantee the safety of passengers, it is also necessary to provide technical prescriptions to allow accessibility for persons of reduced mobility to the vehicles covered by the Directive, in accordance with the Community transport and social policies. Every effort must be made to improve access to these vehicles. To this end, accessibility for persons of reduced mobility can be achieved either by technical solutions applied to the vehicle, as covered by this Directive, or by combining them with appropriate local infrastructure to guarantee access for wheelchair users.</p><p>(12) As a result of the foregoing, it is necessary to amend Directive 70/156/EEC and Directive 97/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 1997 relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers(6).</p><p>(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>For the purposes of this Directive:</p><p>- &quot;vehicle&quot; shall mean any motor vehicle of category M2 or M3, as defined in Annex II, Part A, of Directive 70/156/EEC,</p><p>- &quot;bodywork&quot; shall mean a separate technical unit as defined in Article 2 of Directive 70/156/EEC,</p><p>- &quot;class of vehicle&quot; shall mean a vehicle which complies with the class description given in Annex I to this Directive.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>1.

Paragraph 1 shall also apply to low-floor vehicles of Class I or II, type-approved before 13 August 2002 pursuant to Directive 76/756/EEC, benefiting from the 12,5 % gangway slope specified in paragraph 7.7.6.2 of Annex 1.</p><p>3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 below, with effect from 13 February 2004, Member States:</p><p>- shall no longer grant EC type-approval for a type of vehicle and a type of bodywork as a separate technical unit,</p><p>- may refuse the registration, sale or entry into service of new vehicles and new bodyworks as separate technical units,</p><p>on grounds relating to the provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers and comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver&#039;s seat, if the requirements of this Directive and the Annexes thereto are not complied with.</p><p>4. With effect from 13 February 2005, Member States may refuse the registration, sale or entry into service of new vehicles and new bodyworks as separate technical units which have been type-approved according to the provisions of paragraph 2.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>1. Vehicles of Class I shall be accessible for people with reduced mobility including wheelchair users according to the technical provisions laid down in Annex VII.</p><p>2.

This does not exclude the presence in the step well, when the door is closed, of the door-operating mechanism and other equipment attached to the inside of the door which does not form an extension of the floor on which passengers may stand. This mechanism and equipment should not be dangerous for the passengers.</p><p>7.6.4.6. If the direct view is not adequate, optical or other devices shall be installed to enable the driver to detect from his seat the presence of a passenger in the immediate interior and exterior vicinity of every side service door which is not an automatically operated service door. In the case of a service door in the rear face of the vehicle not exceeding 22 passengers, this requirement is satisfied if the driver is able to detect the presence of a person 1,3 m tall standing 1 m behind the vehicle.</p><p>7.6.4.7. Every door which opens towards the interior of the vehicle and its mechanism shall be so constructed that its movement is not likely to cause injury to passengers in normal conditions of use. Where necessary, appropriate protection devices shall be fitted.</p><p>7.6.4.8. If a service door is located adjacent to a door to a toilet or other internal compartment the service door shall be proofed against unintentional operation. However, this requirement shall not apply if the door is locked automatically when the vehicle is moving at a speed exceeding 5 km/h.</p><p>7.6.4.9. In the case of vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers, the service doors of which are in the rear face of the vehicle, the leaves shall not be capable of being opened more than 115 ° nor less than 85 ° and, when open, shall be capable of being held automatically in that position. This does not preclude the ability to override that stop and open the door beyond that angle when it is safe to do so; for example, to enable reversing against a high platform for loading or to open the doors through 270 ° to allow a clear loading area behind the vehicle.</p><p>7.6.5. Additional technical requirements for power-operated service doors</p><p>7.6.5.1. In the event of an emergency, every power-operated service door shall be capable, when the vehicle is stationary (but not necessarily when the vehicle is moving), of being opened from inside and, when not locked, from outside by controls which, whether or not the power supply is operating:</p><p>7.6.5.1.1. override all other door controls;</p><p>7.6.5.1.2. in the case of interior controls, are placed on, or within 300 mm of, the door, at a height of not less 1600 mm above the first step;</p><p>7.6.5.1.3. can be easily seen and clearly identified, when approaching the door and when standing in front of the door and if additional to the normal opening controls, be clearly marked for emergency use.</p><p>7.6.5.1.4. can be operated by one person when standing immediately in front of the door;</p><p>7.6.5.1.5. cause the door to open, or enable the door to be easily opened by hand;</p><p>7.6.5.1.6. may be protected by a device which can be easily removed or broken to gain access to the emergency control; the operation of the emergency control, or the removal of a protective cover over the control, shall be indicated to the driver both audibly and visually, and</p><p>7.6.5.1.7. in the case of a driver-operated door which does not comply with the requirements of paragraph 7.6.5.6.2, it shall be such that after the controls have been operated to open the door and returned to their normal position, the door will not close again until the driver subsequently operates a closing control.</p><p>7.6.5.2. A device may be provided which is operated by the driver from the driving seat to deactivate the outside emergency controls in order to lock the service doors from outside. In this case, the outside emergency controls shall be reactivated automatically either by the starting of the engine or before the vehicle reaches a speed of 20 km/h. Subsequently, deactivation of the outside emergency controls shall not occur automatically, but shall require a further action by the driver.</p><p>7.6.5.3. Every driver-operated service door shall be capable of operation by the driver when in the driving seat using controls which, except in the case of a foot control, are clearly and distinctively marked.</p><p>7.6.5.4. Every power-operated service door shall activate a visual tell-tale, which shall be plainly visible to the driver when seated in the normal driving position in any ambient lighting condition, to warn that a door is not fully closed. This tell-tale shall signal whenever the rigid structure of the door is between the fully open position and a point 30 mm from the fully closed position. One tell-tale may serve for one or more doors. However, no such tell-tale shall be fitted in respect of a front service door which does not comply with the requirements of 7.6.5.6.1.1 and 7.6.5.6.1.2.</p><p>7.6.5.5. Where controls are provided for the driver to open and close a power operated service door, they shall be such that the driver is able to reverse the movement of the door at any time during the closing or opening process.</p><p>7.6.5.6. The construction and control system of every power-operated service door shall be such that a passenger is unlikely to be injured by the door or trapped in the door as it closes.</p><p>7.6.5.6.1. This requirement shall be considered satisfied if the following two requirements are met.</p><p>7.6.5.6.1.1. The first requirement is that when the closing of the door at any measuring point described in Annex V is resisted by a clamping force not exceeding 150 N, the door shall reopen automatically to its fullest extent and, except in the case of an automatically-operated service door, remain open until a closing control is operated. The clamping force may be measured by any method to the satisfaction of the competent authority. Guidelines are given in Annex V to this Directive. The peak force may be higher than 150 N for a short time provided that it does not exceed 300 N. The reopening system may be checked by means of a test bar having a section of height 60 mm, width 30 mm with corners radiused to 5 mm.</p><p>7.6.5.6.1.2. The second requirement is that whenever the doors are closed onto the wrist or fingers of a passenger:</p><p>7.6.5.6.1.2.1. the door reopens automatically to its fullest extent and, except in the case of an automatically operated service door, remains open until a closing control is operated, or</p><p>7.6.5.6.1.2.2. the wrist or fingers can be readily extracted from the doors without risk of injury to the passenger. This requirement may be checked by hand, or by means of the test bar mentioned in paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.1, tapered at one end over a length of 300 mm from a thickness of 30 mm to a thickness of 5 mm. It shall not be treated with polish nor lubricated. If the door traps the bar it shall be capable of being easily removed, or</p><p>7.6.5.6.1.2.3. the door is maintained at a position allowing the free passage of a test bar having a section of height 60 mm, width 20 mm, with corners radiused to 5 mm. This position shall not be more than 30 mm distant from the fully closed position.</p><p>7.6.5.6.2. In the case of a front service door the requirement of paragraph 7.6.5.6 shall be considered satisfied if the door:</p><p>7.6.5.6.2.1. fulfils the requirements of paragraphs 7.6.5.6.1.1 and 7.6.5.6.1.2, or</p><p>7.6.5.6.2.2. is fitted with soft edges; these shall not, however be so soft that if the doors are closed on the test bar mentioned in paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.1 the rigid structure of the doors will reach the fully closed position.</p><p>7.6.5.7. Where a power-operated service door is held closed only by continued application of the power supply there shall be provided a visual warning device to inform the driver of any failure in the power supply to the doors.</p><p>7.6.5.8. A starting prevention device, if fitted, shall be effective only at speeds of less than 5 km/h and shall be incapable of operation above that speed.</p><p>7.6.5.9. If the vehicle is not fitted with a starting prevention device, an audible warning to the driver shall be activated if the vehicle is driven away from rest when any power-operated service door is not fully closed. This audible warning shall be activated at a speed exceeding 5 km/h for doors complying with the requirements of paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.2.3.</p><p>7.6.6. Additional technical requirements for automatically operated service doors</p><p>7.6.6.1. Activation of the opening controls</p><p>7.6.6.1.1. Except as provided in paragraph 7.6.5.1, the opening controls of every automatically operated service door shall be capable of being activated and deactivated only by the driver from his seat.</p><p>7.6.6.1.2. Activation and deactivation may be either direct, by means of a switch, or indirect, for example by opening and closing the front service door.</p><p>7.6.6.1.3. Activation of the opening controls by the driver shall be indicated inside and, where a door is to be opened from outside, also on the outside of the vehicle; the indicator (e.g. illuminated push-button, illuminated sign) shall be on or adjacent to the door to which it relates.</p><p>7.6.6.1.4. In the case of direct actuation by means of a switch, the functional state of the system shall be clearly indicated to the driver, by, for example, the position of the switch or an indicator lamp or an illuminated switch. The switch shall be specially marked and arranged in such a way that it cannot be confused with other controls.</p><p>7.6.6.2. Opening of automatically operated service doors</p><p>7.6.6.2.1. After activation of the opening controls by the driver, it shall be possible for passengers to open the door as follows:</p><p>7.6.6.2.1.1. from inside, for example by pressing a push-button or passing a light barrier, and</p><p>7.6.6.2.1.2. from outside, except in the case of a door intended only as an exit and marked as such, by, for example, pressing an illuminated push-button, a push-button beneath an illuminated sign, or a similar device marked with a suitable instruction.</p><p>7.6.6.2.2. The pressing of the push-buttons mentioned in paragraph 7.6.6.2.1.1, and the use of the means of communication with the driver mentioned in paragraph 7.7.9.1, may send a signal which is stored and which, after the activation of the opening controls by the driver, effects the opening of the door.</p><p>7.6.6.3. Closing of automatically operated service doors</p><p>7.6.6.3.1. When an automatically operated service door has opened it shall close again automatically after a time interval has elapsed. If a passenger enters or leaves the vehicle during this time interval, a safety device (e.g. a footboard contact, light barrier, one-way gate) shall ensure that the time until the door closes is sufficiently extended.</p><p>7.6.6.3.2. If the passenger enters or leaves the vehicle while the door is closing, the closing process shall be interrupted automatically and the door shall return to the open position. The reversal may be actuated by one of the safety devices referred to in paragraph 7.6.6.3.1 or by any other device.</p><p>7.6.6.3.3. A door that has closed automatically in accordance with paragraph 7.6.6.3.1 shall be capable of being opened again by a passenger in accordance with paragraph 7.6.6.2; this shall not apply if the driver has deactivated the opening controls.</p><p>7.6.6.3.4. After deactivation of the opening controls of the automatically operated service doors by the driver, open doors shall close in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.6.3.1 to 7.6.6.3.2.</p><p>7.6.6.4. Inhibition of the automatic closing process on doors marked for special service, e.g. for passengers with prams, passengers with reduced mobility, etc.</p><p>7.6.6.4.1. The driver shall be able to inhibit the automatic closing process by actuation of a special control. A passenger shall also be able to inhibit the automatic closing process directly by pressing a special push-button.</p><p>7.6.6.4.2. The inhibition of the automatic closing process shall be indicated to the driver, e.g. by a visual tell-tale.</p><p>7.6.6.4.3. Re-establishment of the automatic closing process shall in any case be capable of being done by the driver.</p><p>7.6.6.4.4. Paragraph 7.6.6.3 shall apply to the subsequent closing of the door.</p><p>7.6.7. Technical requirements for emergency doors</p><p>7.6.7.1. Emergency doors shall be capable of being easily opened from inside and from outside when the vehicle is stationary. However, this requirement shall not be construed as precluding the possibility of locking the door from the outside, provided that the door can always be opened from the inside by the use of the normal opening mechanism.</p><p>7.6.7.2. Emergency doors, during their use as such, shall not be of the power-operated type unless, once the control prescribed in paragraph 7.6.5.1 has been actuated and returned to its normal position, the doors do not close again until the driver subsequently operates a closing control. They shall also not be of the sliding type except in the case of vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers. For these vehicles a sliding door, which has been shown to be capable of being opened without the use of tools after a frontal barrier collision test in accordance with Directive 74/297/EEC, can be accepted as an emergency door.</p><p>7.6.7.3. Every control or device for opening an emergency door from the outside shall be between 1000 and 1500 mm from the ground and not more than 500 mm from the door. In vehicles of Classes I, II and III every control or device for opening a emergency door from the inside shall be between 1000 and 1500 mm from the upper surface of the floor or step nearest to the control and be not more than 500 mm from the door. This shall not apply to controls located within the drivers area.</p><p>7.6.7.4. Hinged emergency doors fitted to the side of the vehicle shall be hinged at their forward edge and shall open outwards. Check-straps, chains or other restraining devices shall be permitted, provided that they do not prevent the door from opening to, and remaining open at, an angle of at least 100 °. If a means is provided sufficient to give free passage to the emergency door access gauge, the 100 ° minimum angle shall not apply.</p><p>7.6.7.5. Emergency doors shall be proofed against unintentional operation. However, this requirement shall not apply if the emergency door is locked automatically when the vehicle is moving at a speed exceeding 5 km/h.</p><p>7.6.7.6. All emergency doors shall be provided with an audible device to warn the driver when they are not securely closed. The warning device shall be operated by movement of the door catch or handle and not by movement of the door itself.</p><p>7.6.8. Technical requirements for emergency windows</p><p>7.6.8.1. Every hinged or ejectable emergency window shall open outwards. Ejectable types shall not become totally detached from the vehicle when operated. The operation of ejectable windows shall be such that inadvertent ejection is effectively prevented.</p><p>7.6.8.2. Every emergency window shall:</p><p>7.6.8.2.1. either be capable of being easily and instantaneously operated from inside and from outside the vehicle by means of a device recognised as satisfactory, or</p><p>7.6.8.2.2. be made of readily breakable safety glass. This latter provision precludes the possibility of using panes of laminated glass or of plastic material. A device shall be provided adjacent to each emergency window, readily available to persons inside the vehicle, to ensure that each window can be broken.</p><p>7.6.8.3. Every emergency window which can be locked from the outside shall be so constructed as to be capable of being opened at all times from inside the vehicle.</p><p>7.6.8.4. If the emergency window is of a type horizontally hinged at the top edge, an appropriate device shall be provided to hold it fully open. Every hinged emergency window shall operate so as not to obstruct clear passage from inside or outside the vehicle.</p><p>7.6.8.5. The height of the lower edge of an emergency window fitted in the side of the vehicle from the general level of the floor immediately below it (excluding any local variations such as the presence of a wheel or transmission housing) shall be not more than 1200 mm nor less than 650 mm in the case of a hinged emergency window, or 500 mm in the case of a window made of breakable glass.</p><p>However, in the case of a hinged emergency window, the height of the lower edge may be reduced to a minimum of 500 mm provided that the window aperture is equipped with a guard up to a height of 650 mm to prevent the possibility of passengers falling out of the vehicle. Where the window aperture is equipped with a guard, the size of the window aperture above the guard shall not be less than the minimum size prescribed for an emergency window.</p><p>7.6.8.6. Every hinged emergency window which is not clearly visible from the driver&#039;s seat shall be fitted with an audible warning device to warn the driver when it is not completely closed. The window lock, and not the movement of the window itself, shall actuate this device.</p><p>7.6.9. Technical requirements for escape hatches</p><p>7.6.9.1. Every escape hatch shall operate so as not to obstruct the clear passage from inside or outside the vehicle.</p><p>7.6.9.2. Roof escape hatches shall be either ejectable, hinged or made of readily breakable safety glass. Floor hatches shall be either hinged or ejectable and shall be fitted with an audible warning device to warn the driver when it is not securely closed. The floor escape hatch lock, and not the movement of the hatch itself, shall actuate this device. Floor escape hatches shall be proofed against unintentional operation. However this requirement shall not apply if the floor hatch is locked automatically when the vehicle is moving at a speed exceeding 5 km/h.</p><p>7.6.9.3. Ejectable types shall not become totally detached from the vehicle when operated such that the hatch is not a danger to other road users. The operation of ejectable escape hatches shall be such that inadvertent operation is effectively prevented. Floor ejectable hatches shall eject only into the passenger compartment.</p><p>7.6.9.4. Hinged escape hatches shall hinge along the edge towards the front or rear of the vehicle and shall hinge through an angle of at least 100 °. Hinged floor escape hatches shall hinge into the passenger compartment.</p><p>7.6.9.5. Escape hatches shall be capable of being easily opened or removed from the inside and from the outside. However, this requirement shall not be construed as precluding the possibility of locking the escape hatch for the purpose of securing the vehicle when unattended, provided that the escape hatch can always be opened or removed from the inside by the use of the normal opening or removal mechanism. In the case of a readily breakable hatch, a device shall be provided adjacent to the hatch, readily available to persons inside the vehicle, to ensure that the hatch can be broken.</p><p>7.6.10. Technical requirements for retractable steps</p><p>Retractable steps if fitted shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p>7.6.10.1. the operation of retractable steps may be synchronised with that of the corresponding service or emergency door;</p><p>7.6.10.2. when the door is closed no part of the retractable step shall project more than 10 mm beyond the adjacent line of the bodywork;</p><p>7.6.10.3. when the door is open and the retractable step is in the extended position, the surface area shall conform to the requirements of paragraph 7.7.7 of this Annex;</p><p>7.6.10.4. in the case of a power-operated step, it shall not be possible for the vehicle to move from rest, under its own power, when the step is in the extended position. In the case of a manually operated step, an audible indication shall alert the driver when the step is not fully retracted;</p><p>7.6.10.5. a power-operated step shall not be capable of being extended when the vehicle is in motion. If the device to operate the step fails, the step shall retract and remain in the retracted position. However, the operation of the corresponding door shall not be hindered in the event of such a failure or by the step being damaged or obstructed;</p><p>7.6.10.6. when a passenger is standing on a power-operated retractable step, the corresponding door shall be incapable of being closed. Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by placing a mass of 15 kg, representing a small child, at the centre of the step. This requirement shall not apply to any door within the driver&#039;s direct field of view;</p><p>7.6.10.7. the movement of the retractable step shall not be liable to cause any bodily harm either to passengers or to persons waiting at bus stops;</p><p>7.6.10.8. the corners of retractable steps facing forwards or rearwards shall be rounded to a radius of not less than 5 mm; the edges shall be rounded to a radius of not less than 2,5 mm;</p><p>7.6.10.9. when the passenger door is open, the retractable step shall be securely held in the extended position. When a mass of 136 kg is placed in the centre of a single step or a mass of 272 kg is placed in the centre of a double step the deflection at any point on the step shall not exceed 10 mm.</p><p>7.6.11. Markings</p><p>7.6.11.1. Each emergency exit shall be marked, inside and outside the vehicle, by an inscription reading, for example:</p><p>&quot;Emergency exit&quot;</p><p>&quot;Issue de secours&quot;</p><p>&quot;Salida de emergencia&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nødudgang&quot;</p><p>&quot;Notausstieg&quot;</p><p>&quot;Έξοδος κινδύνου&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uscita di sicurezza&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nooduitgang&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saida de emergência&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hätäuloskäynti&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nödutgång&quot;</p><p>supplemented, where appropriate, by one of the symbols shown in Annex II, paragraph 3.4 of Council Directive 92/58/EEC.</p><p>7.6.11.2. The emergency controls of service doors and of all emergency exits shall be marked as such inside and outside the vehicle either by a representative symbol or by a clearly-worded inscription.</p><p>7.6.11.3. Clear instructions concerning the method of operation shall be placed on or close to every emergency control of an exit.</p><p>7.6.11.4. The language in which any textual markings intended to comply with paragraphs 7.6.11.1 to 7.6.11.3 above are to be inscribed shall be determined by the approving authority bearing in mind the country/countries in which the applicant intends to market the vehicle in liaison if necessary with the competent authorities of the country/countries concerned. If the authority of the country/countries where the vehicle is to be registered has the language changed, this change shall imply no new type-approval process.</p><p>7.7. Interior arrangements</p><p>7.7.1. Access to service doors (see Annex III, figure 1)</p><p>7.7.1.1. The free space extending inwards into the vehicle from the side wall in which the door is mounted shall permit the free passage of a vertical rectangular panel 20 mm thick, 400 mm wide and 700 mm in height above the floor, having a second panel 550 mm wide superimposed symmetrically above it; the height of the second panel being as prescribed for the relevant class of vehicle. The dual panel shall be maintained parallel with the door aperture as it is moved from the starting position, where the plane of the face nearest to the interior of the vehicle is tangential to the outermost edge of the aperture, to the position where is touches the first step, after which it shall be kept at right angles to the probable direction of motion of a person using the entrance.</p><p>7.7.1.2. The height of the upper rectangular panel shall be for the relevant class of vehicle and category as prescribed in the table below. As an alternative, a trapezoidal section, having a height of 500 mm, forming the transition between the width of the upper and the lower panel, may be used. In this case, the total height of the rectangular section and this trapezoidal section of the upper panel shall be 1100 mm for all classes of vehicles with a capacity exceeding 22 passengers, and 950 mm for the classes of vehicle with a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers.</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>7.7.1.3. When the centre line of this dual panel has traversed a distance of 300 mm from its starting position and the dual panel is touching the step surface it shall be retained in that position.</p><p>7.7.1.4. The cylindrical figure (see Annex III, figure 6) used for testing the gangway clearance shall then be moved starting from the gangway, in the probable direction of motion of a person leaving the vehicle, until its centre line has reached the vertical plane which contains the top edge of the uppermost step, or until a plane tangential to the upper cylinder touches the dual panel, whichever occurs first, and retained in that position (see Annex III, figure 2).</p><p>7.7.1.5. Between the cylindrical figure, at the position set out in paragraph 7.7.1.4, and the dual panel, at the position set out in paragraph 7.7.1.3, there shall be a free space whose upper and lower limits are shown in Annex III, figure 2. This free space shall permit the free passage of a vertical panel whose form and dimensions are the same as the cylindrical form (paragraph 7.7.5.1), central section and a thickness of no more than 20 mm. This panel shall be moved, from the cylindrical form tangential position, until its external side is in contact with the dual panel interior side, touching the plane or planes defined by the step upper edges, in the probable direction of motion of a person using the entrance (see Annex III, figure 2).</p><p>7.7.1.6. The free passage clearance for this figure shall not include any space extending to 300 mm in front of any uncompressed seat cushion of a forward or rearward facing seat or 225 mm in the case of seats fitted at wheel arches, and to the height of the top of the seat cushion.</p><p>7.7.1.7. In the case of a folding seat, this space shall be determined with the seat in the position of use.</p><p>7.7.1.8. However, a folding seat for use by the crew may obstruct the access passage to a service door when in the position of use provided that:</p><p>7.7.1.8.1. it is clearly indicated, both in the vehicle itself and on the EC type-approval certificate (see Annex II, Appendix 2), that the seat is for the use of crew only;</p><p>7.7.1.8.2. when the seat is not in use it folds automatically as necessary to enable the requirements of paragraphs 7.7.1.1 or 7.7.1.2 and 7.7.1.3, 7.7.1.4 and 7.7.1.5 to be met;</p><p>7.7.1.8.3. the door is not considered to be a mandatory exit for the purpose of paragraph 7.6.1.4, and</p><p>7.7.1.8.4. when the seat is in the position of use, and when it is in the folded position, no part of it shall be forward of a vertical plane passing through the centre of the seating surface of the driver&#039;s seat in its rearmost position and through the centre of the exterior rear-view mirror mounted on the opposite side of the vehicle.</p><p>7.7.1.9. In the case of vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers a doorway and the route by which passengers gain access to it shall be considered unobstructed if they have:</p><p>7.7.1.9.1. measured parallel with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, there is a clearance of not less than 220 mm at any point and 550 mm at any point being more than 500 mm above the floor or steps (Annex III, figure 3);</p><p>7.7.1.9.2. measured perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, there is a clearance of not less than 300 mm at any point and 550 mm at any point being more than 1200 mm above the floor or steps or less than 300 mm below the ceiling (Annex III, figure 4).</p><p>7.7.1.10. The service door and emergency door dimensions in paragraph 7.6.3.1 and the requirements of paragraphs 7.7.1.1 to 7.7.1.7, 7.7.2.1 to 7.7.2.3, 7.7.5.1 and 7.7.8.5 shall not apply to a vehicle of Class B with a technically permissible maximum mass not exceeding 3,5 tonnes and up to 12 passengers seats in which each seat has unobstructed access to at least two doors.</p><p>7.7.1.11. The maximum slope of the floor in the access passage shall not exceed 5 % when measured with the vehicle at its mass in running order standing on a horizontal surface. Any kneeling device shall not be engaged.</p><p>7.7.2. Access to emergency doors (see Annex III, figure 5)</p><p>The following requirements shall not apply to driver&#039;s doors used as emergency exits in vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers.</p><p>7.7.2.1. The free space between the gangway and the emergency door aperture shall permit the free passage of a vertical cylinder 300 mm in diameter and 700 mm high from the floor and supporting a second vertical cylinder 550 mm in diameter, the aggregate height of the assembly being 1400 mm.</p><p>The diameter of the upper cylinder may be reduced at the top to 400 mm when a chamfer not exceeding 30 ° from the horizontal is included.</p><p>7.7.2.2. The base of the first cylinder shall be within the projection of the second cylinder.</p><p>7.7.2.3. Where folding seats are installed alongside this passage, the free space for the cylinder shall be required to be determined when the seat is in the position for use.</p><p>7.7.2.4. As an alternative to the dual cylinder, the gauging device described in paragraph 7.7.5.1 may be used (see Annex III, figure 6).</p><p>7.7.3. Access to emergency windows</p><p>7.7.3.1. It shall be possible to move a test gauge from the gangway to the exterior of the vehicle through every emergency window.</p><p>7.7.3.2. The direction of motion of the test gauge shall be in the direction in which a passenger evacuating the vehicle would be expected to move. The test gauge shall be kept perpendicular to that direction of motion.</p><p>7.7.3.3. The test gauge shall be in the form of a thin plate having a size of 600 × 400 mm with corners radiused by 200 mm. However, in the case of an emergency window in the rear face of the vehicle, the test gauge may alternatively have a size of 1400 mm × 350 mm with corners radiused by 175 mm.</p><p>7.7.4. Access to escape hatches</p><p>7.7.4.1. Escape hatches in the roof</p><p>7.7.4.1.1. Except in the case of Class I vehicles, at least one escape hatch shall be located such that a four-sided truncated pyramid having a side angle of 20 ° and a height of 1600 mm touches part of a seat or equivalent support.

A vehicle may be shown to meet the requirement specified in paragraph 7.4 of Annex I by a calculation method approved by the technical service for conducting the tests.</p><p>2. The technical service responsible for conducting the tests may require tests to be carried out on parts of the vehicle to verify the assumptions made in the calculation.</p><p>3. Preparations for calculation</p><p>3.1. The vehicle shall be represented by a spatial system.</p><p>3.2. Due to the location of the centre of gravity of the body of the vehicle and the different spring rates of the vehicle suspension and tyres, axles do not generally lift simultaneously on one side of the vehicle as a result of lateral acceleration. Therefore, lateral tilting of the body over each axle has to be ascertained on the supposition that the wheels of the other axle(s) remain on the ground.</p><p>3.3. To simplify matters, it shall be assumed that the centre of gravity of the unsprung masses lies in the longitudinal plane of the vehicle on the line passing through the centre of the wheel rotation axle. The small shifting of the roll centre due to deflection of the axle can be neglected. The air suspension control should not be taken into account.</p><p>3.4.

General</p><p>The closing of a power-operated door is a dynamic process. When a moving door hits an obstacle, the result is a dynamic reaction force, the history of which (in time) depends on several factors (e.g. mass of the door, acceleration, dimensions).</p><p>2. Definitions</p><p>2.1. Closing force F(t) is a time function, measured at the closing edges of the door (see paragraph 3.2 below).</p><p>2.2. Peak force FS is the maximum value of the closing force.</p><p>2.3. Effective force FE is the average value of the closing force related to the pulse duration:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>2.4. Pulse duration T is the time between the t1 and t2:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>where:</p><p>t1= threshold of sensitivity, where the closing force exceeds 50 N,</p><p>t2= fade-away threshold, where the closing force becomes less than 50 N.</p><p>2.5. The relation between the above parameters is shown in figure 1 below (as an example):</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>&gt;PIC FILE= &quot;L_2002042EN.008302.TIF&quot;&gt;</p><p>2.6. Clamping force Fc is the arithmetical mean value of the effective forces, measured at the same measuring point subsequently more times:</p><p>&gt;REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>3. Measurements</p><p>3.1. Conditions of measurement:</p><p>3.1.1. temperature range: 10° to 30 °C;</p><p>3.1.2. the vehicle shall stay on a horizontal surface.</p><p>3.2. Measurement points shall be:</p><p>3.2.1. at the main closing edges of the door:</p><p>- one in the middle of the door,</p><p>- one 150 mm above the lower edge of the door;</p><p>3.2.2. in the case of doors equipped with clamping prevention devices for the opening process:</p><p>at the secondary closing edges of the door at that point which is considered to be the most dangerous place of clamping;</p><p>3.2.3. at least three measurements shall be taken at each of the measuring points to determine the clamping force according to paragraph 2.6.</p><p>3.3. The signal of the closing force shall be recorded by means of a low-pass filter with a limiting frequency of 100 Hz. Both the threshold of sensitivity and the fade-away threshold to limit the pulse duration shall be set at 50 N.</p><p>3.5. The deviation of the reading from the rated value shall not be more than ± 3 %.</p><p>4. Measuring device</p><p>4.1. The measuring device shall consist of two parts: one handle and one measuring part which is a load cell (see figure 2).</p><p>4.2. The load cell shall have the following characteristics:</p><p>4.2.1. it shall consist of two sliding housings with the outer dimension of 100 mm in diameter and 115 mm in width. Inside the load cell a compression spring shall be fitted between the two housings such that the load cell can be pressed together if an appropriate force is applied.</p><p>4.2.2. the stiffness of the load cell shall be 10 ± 0,2 N/mm. The maximum spring deflection shall be limited to 30 mm so that a maximum peak force of 300 N is achieved.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>&gt;PIC FILE= &quot;L_2002042EN.008501.TIF&quot;&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX VI</p><p></p><p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VEHICLES HAVING A CAPACITY NOT EXCEEDING 22 PASSENGERS</p><p>1.1.
