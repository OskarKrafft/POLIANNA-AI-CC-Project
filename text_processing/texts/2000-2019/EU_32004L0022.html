<p>Directive 2004/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 31 March 2004</p><p>on measuring instruments</p><p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) A number of measuring instruments are covered by specific Directives, adopted on the basis of Council Directive 71/316/EEC of 26 July 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to common provisions for both measuring instruments and methods of metrological control(4). Specific Directives that are technically outdated should be repealed and replaced by an independent Directive reflecting the spirit of the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards(5).</p><p>(2) Correct and traceable measuring instruments can be used for a variety of measurement tasks. Those responding to reasons of public interest, public health, safety and order, protection of the environment and the consumer, of levying taxes and duties and of fair trading, which directly and indirectly affect the daily life of citizens in many ways, may require the use of legally controlled measuring instruments.</p><p>(3) Legal metrological control should not lead to barriers to the free movement of measuring instruments. The provisions concerned should be the same in all Member States and proof of conformity accepted throughout the Community.</p><p>(4) Legal metrological control requires conformity with specified performance requirements. The performance requirements that the measuring instruments must meet should provide a high level of protection. The conformity assessment should provide a high level of confidence.</p><p>(5) Member States should as a general rule prescribe legal metrological control. Where legal metrological control is prescribed, only measuring instruments complying with common performance requirements should be used.</p><p>(6) The principle of optionality introduced by this Directive, whereby Member States may exercise their right to decide whether or not to regulate any of the instruments covered by this Directive, should be applicable only to the extent that this will not cause unfair competition.</p><p>(7) The responsibilities of the manufacturer for compliance with the requirements of this Directive should be specifically stated.</p><p>(8) The performance of measuring instruments is particularly sensitive to the environment, particular the electromagnetic environment. Immunity of measuring instruments to electromagnetic interference forms an integral part of this Directive and the immunity requirements of Council Directive 89/336/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility(6) should therefore not apply.</p><p>(9) Community legislation should specify essential requirements that do not impede technical progress, preferably performance requirements. Provisions to remove technical barriers to trade should follow the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonisation and standards.</p><p>(10) In order to take account of differences in climatic conditions or of different levels of consumer protection that may apply at national level, essential requirements may give rise to the establishment of environmental or accuracy classes.</p><p>(11) In order to ease the task of proving conformity with the essential requirements and to enable conformity to be assessed, it is desirable to have harmonised standards. Such harmonised standards are drawn up by private-law bodies and should retain their status as non-mandatory texts. To this end, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) are recognised as the competent bodies for the adoption of harmonised standards in accordance with the general guidelines on cooperation between the Commission and the European Standardisation bodies signed on 13 November 1984.</p><p>(12) The technical and performance specifications of internationally agreed normative documents may also comply, in part or in full, with the essential requirements laid down by this Directive. In those cases the use of these internationally agreed normative documents can be an alternative to the use of harmonised standards and, under specific conditions, give rise to a presumption of conformity.</p><p>(13) Conformity with the essential requirements laid down by this Directive can also be provided by specifications that are not supplied by a European technical standard or an internationally agreed normative document. The use of European technical standards or internationally agreed normative documents should therefore be optional.</p><p>(14) The conformity assessment of sub-assemblies should respect the provisions of this Directive. If sub-assemblies are traded separately and independently of an instrument, the exercise of conformity assessment should be undertaken independently of the instrument concerned.</p><p>(15) The state of the art in measurement technology is subject to constant evolution which may lead to changes in the needs for conformity assessments. Therefore, for each category of measurement and, where appropriate, sub-assemblies, there must be an appropriate procedure or a choice between different procedures of equivalent stringency. The procedures adopted are as required by Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the &quot;CE&quot; marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation Directives(7). However, derogations may have to be made for these modules in order to reflect specific aspects of metrological control. Provision should be made for the &quot;CE&quot; marking to be affixed during the fabrication process.</p><p>(16) Continued development in measurement technology as well as concerns expressed by stakeholders about certification, stress the need to ensure consistent conformity assessment procedures for industrial products, as requested by the Council Resolution adopted on 10 November 2003(8).</p><p>(17) Member States should not impede the placing on the market and/or putting into use of measuring instruments that carry the &quot;CE&quot; marking and supplementary metrology marking in accordance with the provisions of this Directive.</p><p>(18) Member States should take appropriate action to prevent non-complying measuring instruments from being placed on the market and/or put into use. Adequate cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States is therefore necessary to ensure a Community-wide effect of this objective.</p><p>(19) Manufacturers should be informed of the grounds on which negative decisions in respect of their products were taken, and of the legal remedies available to them.</p><p>(20) Manufacturers should be offered the possibility to exercise the rights obtained before the entry into force of this Directive, during a reasonable transitional period.</p><p>(21) National specifications concerning the appropriate national requirements in use should not interfere with the provisions of this Directive on &quot;putting into use&quot;.</p><p>(22) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).</p><p>(23) The activity of the Measuring Instruments Commmittee should include proper consultations with representatives of interested parties.</p><p>(24) Directives 71/318/EEC, 71/319/EEC, 71/348/EEC, 73/362/EEC, 75/33/EEC, as concerns the meters defined in Annex MI-001 of this Directive, 75/410/EEC, 76/891/EEC, 77/95/EEC, 77/313/EEC, 78/1031/EEC and 79/830/EEC should therefore be repealed,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>Scope</p><p>This Directive applies to the devices and systems with a measuring function defined in the instrument-specific annexes concerning water meters (MI-001), gas meters and volume conversion devices (MI-002), active electrical energy meters (MI-003), heat meters (MI-004), measuring systems for continuous and dynamic measurement of quantities of liquids other then water (MI-005), automatic weighing instruments (MI-006), taximeters (MI-007), material measures (MI-008), dimensional measuring instruments (MI-009) and exhaust gas analysers (MI-010).</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>1. Member States may prescribe the use of measuring instruments mentioned in Article 1 for measuring tasks for reasons of public interest, public health, public safety, public order, protection of the environment, protection of consumers, levying of taxes and duties and fair trading, where they consider it justified.</p><p>2. Where Member States do not prescribe such use, they shall communicate the reasons therefor to the Commission and the other Member States.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>Object</p><p>This Directive establishes the requirements that the devices and systems referred to in Article 1 have to satisfy with a view to their being placed on the market and/or put into use for those tasks mentioned in Article 2(1).</p><p>This Directive is a specific Directive in respect of requirements for electromagnetic immunity in the sense of Article 2(2) of Directive 89/336/EEC. Directive 89/336/EEC continues to apply with regard to emission requirements.</p><p></p><p>Article 4</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Directive:</p><p>(a) &quot;measuring instrument&quot; means any device or system with a measurement function that is covered by Articles 1 and 3;</p><p>(b) &quot;sub-assembly&quot; means a hardware device, mentioned as such in the specific annexes, that functions independently and makes up a measuring instrument together</p><p>- with other sub-assemblies with which it is compatible, or</p><p>- with a measuring instrument with which it is compatible;</p><p>(c) &quot;legal metrological control&quot; means the control of the measurement tasks intended for the field of application of a measuring instrument, for reasons of public interest, public health, public safety, public order, protection of the environment, levying of taxes and duties, protection of the consumers and fair trading;</p><p>(d) &quot;manufacturer&quot; means a natural or legal person responsible for the conformity of the measuring instrument with this Directive with a view to either placing it on the market under his own name and/or putting it into use for his own purposes;</p><p>(e) &quot;placing on the market&quot; means making available for the first time in the Community an instrument intended for an end user, whether for reward or free of charge;</p><p>(f) &quot;putting into use&quot; means the first use of an instrument intended for the end user for the purposes for which it was intended;</p><p>(g) &quot;authorised representative&quot; means a natural or legal person who is established within the Community and authorised by a manufacturer, in writing, to act on his behalf for specified tasks within the meaning of this Directive;</p><p>(h) &quot;harmonised standard&quot; means a technical specification adopted by CEN, CENELEC or ETSI or jointly by two or all of these organisations, at the request of the Commission pursuant to Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services(10) and prepared in accordance with the General Guidelines agreed between the Commission and the European standards organisations;</p><p>(i) &quot;normative document&quot; means a document containing technical specifications adopted by the Organisation Internationale de Métrologie Légale (OIML), subject to the procedure stipulated in Article 16(1).</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>Applicability to sub-assemblies</p><p>Where specific annexes exist, laying down the essential requirements for sub-assemblies, the provisions of this Directive shall apply mutatis mutandis to such sub-assemblies.</p><p>Sub-assemblies and measuring instruments may be assessed independently and separately for the purpose of establishing conformity.</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>Essential requirements and assessment of conformity</p><p>1. A measuring instrument shall meet the essential requirements laid down in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annex.</p><p>Member States may require, if it is needed for correct use of the instrument, the information referred to in Annex I or in the relevant instrument-specific annexes to be provided in the official language(s) of the Member State in which the instrument is placed on the market.</p><p>2. The conformity of a measuring instrument with the essential requirements shall be assessed in accordance with Article 9.</p><p></p><p>Article 7</p><p>Conformity marking</p><p>1. The conformity of a measuring instrument with all the provisions of this Directive shall be indicated by the presence on it of the &quot;CE&quot; marking and the supplementary metrology marking as specified in Article 17.</p><p>2. The &quot;CE&quot; marking and supplementary metrology marking shall be affixed by, or under the responsibility of, the manufacturer. These markings may be affixed to the instrument during the fabrication process, if justified.</p><p>3. The affixing of markings on a measuring instrument that are likely to deceive third parties as to the meaning and/or form of the &quot;CE&quot; marking and the supplementary metrology marking shall be prohibited. Any other marking may be affixed on a measuring instrument, provided that the visibility and legibility of the &quot;CE&quot; marking and the supplementary metrology marking is not thereby reduced.</p><p>4. Where the measuring instrument is subject to measures adopted under other Directives covering other aspects which require the affixing of the &quot;CE&quot; marking, the marking shall indicate that the instrument in question is also presumed to conform to the requirements of those other Directives. In such a case, the publication reference of the said Directives, in the Official Journal of the European Union, must be given in the documents, notices or instructions required by those Directives and accompanying the measuring instrument.</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>Placing on the market and putting into use</p><p>1. Member States shall not impede for reasons covered by this Directive the placing on the market and/or putting into use of any measuring instrument that carries the &quot;CE&quot; marking and supplementary metrology marking in accordance with Article 7.</p><p>2.

Member States shall notify to the other Member States and the Commission the bodies under their jurisdiction, which they have designated to carry out the tasks pertaining to the conformity assessment modules referred to in Article 9, together with the identification numbers given to them by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, the kind(s) of measuring instrument for which each body has been designated and in addition, where relevant, the instrument accuracy classes, the measuring range, the measurement technology, and any other instrument characteristic limiting the scope of the notification.</p><p>2. Member States shall apply the criteria set out in Article 12 for the designation of such bodies. Bodies that meet the criteria laid down in the national standards which transpose the relevant harmonised standards, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, shall be presumed to meet the corresponding criteria. Member States shall publish the references to these national standards.</p><p>If a Member State has not introduced national legislation for tasks mentioned under Article 2, it shall retain the right to designate and notify a body for tasks relating to that instrument.</p><p>3. A Member State that has notified a body shall:</p><p>- ensure that the body continues to meet the criteria set out in Article 12,</p><p>- withdraw such notification if it finds that the body no longer meets those criteria.</p><p>It shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission of any such withdrawal.</p><p>4. Each of the bodies to be notified shall be given an identification number by the Commission. The Commission shall publish the list of notified bodies, together with the information in respect of the scope of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series, and shall ensure that the list is kept up to date.</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Criteria to be satisfied by designated bodies</p><p>Member States shall apply the following criteria for the designation of bodies in accordance with Article 11(1).</p><p>1. The body, its director and staff involved in conformity assessment tasks shall not be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, installer or user of the measuring instruments that they inspect, nor the authorised representative of any of them. In addition, they may not be directly involved in the design, manufacture, marketing or maintenance of the instruments, nor represent the parties engaged in these activities. The preceding criterion does not, however, preclude in any way the possibility of exchanges of technical information between the manufacturer and the body for the purposes of conformity assessment.</p><p>2. The body, its director and staff involved in conformity assessment tasks shall be free from all pressures and inducements, in particular financial inducements, that might influence their judgement or the results of their conformity assessment, especially from persons or groups of persons with an interest in the results of the assessments.</p><p>3. The conformity assessment shall be carried out with the highest degree of professional integrity and requisite competence in the field of metrology. Should the body subcontract specific tasks, it shall first ensure that the subcontractor meets the requirements of this Directive, and in particular of this Article. The body shall keep the relevant documents assessing the subcontractor&#039;s qualifications and the work carried out by him under this Directive at the disposal of the notifying authority.</p><p>4. The body shall be capable of carrying out all the conformity assessment tasks for which it has been designated, whether those tasks are carried out by the body itself or on its behalf and under its responsibility. It shall have at its disposal the necessary staff and shall have access to the necessary facilities for carrying out in a proper manner the technical and administrative tasks entailed in conformity assessment.</p><p>5. The body&#039;s staff shall have:</p><p>- sound technical and vocational training, covering all conformity assessment tasks for which the body was designated;</p><p>- satisfactory knowledge of the rules governing the tasks which it carries out, and adequate experience of such tasks;</p><p>- the requisite ability to draw up the certificates, records and reports demonstrating that the tasks have been carried out.</p><p>6. The impartiality of the body, its director and staff shall be guaranteed. The remuneration of the body shall not depend on the results of the tasks it carries out.

The body shall take out civil liability insurance if its civil liability is not covered by the Member State concerned under national law.</p><p>8. The body&#039;s director and staff shall be bound to observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in the performance of their duties pursuant to this Directive, except vis-à-vis the authority of the Member State which has designated it.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>Harmonised standards and normative documents</p><p>1. Member States shall presume conformity with the essential requirements referred to in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes in respect of a measuring instrument that complies with the elements of the national standards implementing the European harmonised standard for that measuring instrument that correspond to those elements of this European harmonised standard the references in respect of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series.</p><p>Where a measuring instrument complies only in part with the elements of the national standards referred to in the first subparagraph, Member States shall presume conformity with the essential requirements corresponding to the elements of the national standards with which the instrument complies.</p><p>Member States shall publish the references to the national standards referred to in the first subparagraph.</p><p>2. Member States shall presume conformity with the essential requirements referred to in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes in respect of a measuring instrument that complies with the corresponding parts of the normative documents and lists referred to in Article 16(1)(a), the references in respect of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, C series.</p><p>Where a measuring instrument complies only in part with the normative document referred to in the first subparagraph, Member States shall presume conformity with the essential requirements corresponding to the normative elements with which the instrument complies.</p><p>Member States shall publish the references of the normative document referred to in the first subparagraph.</p><p>3. A manufacturer may choose to use any technical solution that complies with the essential requirements referred to in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes (MI-001 to MI-010). In addition, to benefit from the presumption of conformity, the manufacturer must correctly apply solutions mentioned either in the relevant European harmonised standards, or in the corresponding parts of the normative documents and lists as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.</p><p>4. Member States shall presume compliance with the appropriate tests mentioned in point (i) of Article 10 if the corresponding test programme has been performed in accordance with the relevant documents mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 3 and if the test results ensure compliance with the essential requirements.</p><p></p><p>Article 14</p><p>Standing Committee</p><p>Where a Member State or the Commission considers that a European harmonised standard as referred to in Article 13(1) does not fully meet the essential requirements referred to in Annex I and in the relevant instrument-specific Annexes, the Member State or the Commission shall bring the matter before the Standing Committee set up under Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC, giving its reasons for doing so. The Committee shall deliver an opinion without delay.</p><p>In the light of the Committee&#039;s opinion, the Commission shall inform the Member States whether or not it is necessary to withdraw the references to the national standards from the publication referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 13(1).</p><p></p><p>Article 15</p><p>Measuring Instruments Committee</p><p>1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Measuring Instruments Committee.</p><p>2.

An influence quantity is a disturbance if for that influence quantity the rated operating conditions are not specified.</p><p>Critical change value The critical change value is the value at which the change in the measurement result is considered undesirable.</p><p>Material Measure A material measure is a device intended to reproduce or supply in a permanent manner during its use one or more known values of a given quantity.</p><p>Direct sales A trading transaction is direct sales if:</p><p>- the measurement result serves as the basis for the price to pay and;</p><p>- at least one of the parties involved in the transaction related to measurement is a consumer or any other party requiring a similar level of protection and;</p><p>- all the parties in the transaction accept the measurement result at that time and place.</p><p>Climatic environments Climatic environments are the conditions in which measuring instruments may be used. To cope with climatic differences between the Member States, a range of temperature limits has been defined.</p><p>Utility A utility is regarded as a supplier of electricity, gas, heat or water.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS</p><p>1. Allowable Errors</p><p>1.1. Under rated operating conditions and in the absence of a disturbance, the error of measurement shall not exceed the maximum permissible error (MPE) value as laid down in the appropriate instrument-specific requirements.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise in the instrument-specific annexes, MPE is expressed as a bilateral value of the deviation from the true measurement value.</p><p>1.2. Under rated operating conditions and in the presence of a disturbance, the performance requirement shall be as laid down in the appropriate instrument-specific requirements.</p><p>Where the instrument is intended to be used in a specified permanent continuous electromagnetic field the permitted performance during the radiated electromagnetic field-amplitude modulated test shall be within MPE.</p><p>1.3. The manufacturer shall specify the climatic, mechanical and electromagnetic environments in which the instrument is intended to be used, power supply and other influence quantities likely to affect its accuracy, taking account of the requirements laid down in the appropriate instrument-specific annexes.</p><p>1.3.1. Climatic environments</p><p>The manufacturer shall specify the upper temperature limit and the lower temperature limit from any of the values in Table 1 unless otherwise specified in the Annexes MI-001 to MI-010, and indicate whether the instrument is designed for condensing or non-condensing humidity as well as the intended location for the instrument, i.e. open or closed.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>1.3.2. (a) Mechanical environments are classified into classes M1 to M3 as described below.</p><p>M1 This class applies to instruments used in locations with vibration and shocks of low significance, e.g. for instruments fastened to light supporting structures subject to negligible vibrations and shocks transmitted from local blasting or pile-driving activities, slamming doors, etc.</p><p>M2 This class applies to instruments used in locations with significant or high levels of vibration and shock, e.g. transmitted from machines and passing vehicles in the vicinity or adjacent to heavy machines, conveyor belts, etc.</p><p>M3 This class applies to instruments used in locations where the level of vibration and shock is high and very high, e.g. for instruments mounted directly on machines, conveyor belts, etc.</p><p>(b) The following influence quantities shall be considered in relation with mechanical environments:</p><p>- Vibration;</p><p>- Mechanical shock.</p><p>1.3.3. (a) Electromagnetic environments are classified into classes E1, E2 or E3 as described below, unless otherwise laid down in the appropriate instrument-specific annexes.</p><p>E1 This class applies to instruments used in locations with electromagnetic disturbances corresponding to those likely to be found in residential, commercial and light industrial buildings.</p><p>E2 This class applies to instruments used in locations with electromagnetic disturbances corresponding to those likely to be found in other industrial buildings.</p><p>E3 This class applies to instruments supplied by the battery of a vehicle. Such instruments shall comply with the requirements of E2 and the following additional requirements:</p><p>- voltage reductions caused by energising the starter-motor circuits of internal combustion engines,</p><p>- load dump transients occurring in the event of a discharged battery being disconnected while the engine is running.</p><p>(b) The following influence quantities shall be considered in relation with electromagnetic environments:</p><p>- Voltage interruptions,</p><p>- Short voltage reductions,</p><p>- Voltage transients on supply lines and/or signal lines,</p><p>- Electrostatic discharges,</p><p>- Radio frequency electromagnetic fields,</p><p>- Conducted radio frequency electromagnetic fields on supply lines and/or signal lines,</p><p>- Surges on supply lines and/or signal lines.</p><p>1.3.4. Other influence quantities to be considered, where appropriate, are:</p><p>- Voltage variation,</p><p>- Mains frequency variation,</p><p>- Power frequency magnetic fields,</p><p>- Any other quantity likely to influence in a significant way the accuracy of the instrument.</p><p>1.4. When carrying out the tests as envisaged in this Directive, the following paragraphs apply:</p><p>1.4.1. Basic rules for testing and the determination of errors</p><p>Essential requirements specified in 1.1 and 1.2 shall be verified for each relevant influence quantity. Unless otherwise specified in the appropriate instrument-specific annex, these essential requirements apply when each influence quantity is applied and its effect evaluated separately, all other influence quantities being kept relatively constant at their reference value.</p><p>Metrological tests shall be carried out during or after the application of the influence quantity, whichever condition corresponds to the normal operational status of the instrument when that influence quantity is likely to occur.</p><p>1.4.2. Ambient humidity</p><p>- According to the climatic operating environment in which the instrument is intended to be used either the damp heat-steady state (non-condensing) or damp heat cyclic (condensing) test may be appropriate.</p><p>- The damp heat cyclic test is appropriate where condensation is important or when penetration of vapour will be accelerated by the effect of breathing. In conditions where non-condensing humidity is a factor the damp-heat steady state is appropriate.</p><p>2. Reproducibility</p><p>The application of the same measurand in a different location or by a different user, all other conditions being the same, shall result in the close agreement of successive measurements. The difference between the measurement results shall be small when compared with the MPE.</p><p>3. Repeatability</p><p>The application of the same measurand under the same conditions of measurement shall result in the close agreement of successive measurements. The difference between the measurement results shall be small when compared with the MPE.</p><p>4. Discrimination and Sensitivity</p><p>A measuring instrument shall be sufficiently sensitive and the discrimination threshold shall be sufficiently low for the intended measurement task.</p><p>5. Durability</p><p>A measuring instrument shall be designed to maintain an adequate stability of its metrological characteristics over a period of time estimated by the manufacturer, provided that it is properly installed, maintained and used according to the manufacturer&#039;s instruction when in the environmental conditions for which it is intended.</p><p>6. Reliability</p><p>A measuring instrument shall be designed to reduce as far as possible the effect of a defect that would lead to an inaccurate measurement result, unless the presence of such a defect is obvious.</p><p>7. Suitability</p><p>7.1. A measuring instrument shall have no feature likely to facilitate fraudulent use, whereas possibilities for unintentional misuse shall be minimal.</p><p>7.2. A measuring instrument shall be suitable for its intended use taking account of the practical working conditions and shall not require unreasonable demands of the user in order to obtain a correct measurement result.</p><p>7.3. The errors of a utility measuring instrument at flows or currents outside the controlled range shall not be unduly biased.</p><p>7.4. Where a measuring instrument is designed for the measurement of values of the measurand that are constant over time, the measuring instrument shall be insensitive to small fluctuations of the value of the measurand, or shall take appropriate action.</p><p>7.5. A measuring instrument shall be robust and its materials of construction shall be suitable for the conditions in which it is intended to be used.</p><p>7.6. A measuring instrument shall be designed so as to allow the control of the measuring tasks after the instrument has been placed on the market and put into use. If necessary, special equipment or software for this control shall be part of the instrument. The test procedure shall be described in the operation manual.</p><p>When a measuring instrument has associated software which provides other functions besides the measuring function, the software that is critical for the metrological characteristics shall be identifiable and shall not be inadmissibly influenced by the associated software.</p><p>8. Protection against corruption</p><p>8.1. The metrological characteristics of a measuring instrument shall not be influenced in any inadmissible way by the connection to it of another device, by any feature of the connected device itself or by any remote device that communicates with the measuring instrument.</p><p>8.2. A hardware component that is critical for metrological characteristics shall be designed so that it can be secured. Security measures foreseen shall provide for evidence of an intervention.</p><p>8.3. Software that is critical for metrological characteristics shall be identified as such and shall be secured.</p><p>Software identification shall be easily provided by the measuring instrument.</p><p>Evidence of an intervention shall be available for a reasonable period of time.</p><p>8.4. Measurement data, software that is critical for measurement characteristics and metrologically important parameters stored or transmitted shall be adequately protected against accidental or intentional corruption.</p><p>8.5. For utility measuring instruments the display of the total quantity supplied or the displays from which the total quantity supplied can be derived, whole or partial reference to which is the basis for payment, shall not be able to be reset during use.</p><p>9. Information to be borne by and to accompany the instrument</p><p>9.1. A measuring instrument shall bear the following inscriptions:</p><p>- manufacturer&#039;s mark or name;</p><p>- information in respect of its accuracy,</p><p>plus, when applicable:</p><p>- information in respect of the conditions of use;</p><p>- measuring capacity;</p><p>- measuring range;</p><p>- identity marking;</p><p>- number of the EC-type examination certificate or the EC design examination certificate;</p><p>- information whether or not additional devices providing metrological results comply with the provisions of this Directive on legal metrological control.</p><p>9.2. An instrument of dimensions too small or of too sensitive a composition to allow it to bear the relevant information shall have its packaging, if any, and the accompanying documents required by the provisions of this Directive suitably marked.</p><p>9.3. The instrument shall be accompanied by information on its operation, unless the simplicity of the measuring instrument makes this unnecessary. Information shall be easily understandable and shall include where relevant:</p><p>- rated operating conditions;</p><p>- mechanical and electromagnetic environment classes;</p><p>- the upper and lower temperature limit, whether condensation is possible or not, open or closed location;</p><p>- instructions for installation, maintenance, repairs, permissible adjustments;</p><p>- instructions for correct operation and any special conditions of use;</p><p>- conditions for compatibility with interfaces, sub-assemblies or measuring instruments.</p><p>9.4. Groups of identical measuring instruments used in the same location or used for utility measurements do not necessarily require individual instruction manuals.</p><p>9.5. Unless specified otherwise in an instrument-specific annex, the scale interval for a measured value shall be in the form 1×10n, 2×10n, or 5×10n, where n is any integer or zero. The unit of measurement or its symbol shall be shown close to the numerical value.</p><p>9.6. A material measure shall be marked with a nominal value or a scale, accompanied by the unit of measurement used.</p><p>9.7. The units of measurement used and their symbols shall be in accordance with the provisions of Community legislation on units of measurement and their symbols.</p><p>9.8.

The indication of any result shall be clear and unambiguous and accompanied by such marks and inscriptions necessary to inform the user of the significance of the result. Easy reading of the presented result shall be permitted under normal conditions of use. Additional indications may be shown provided they cannot be confused with the metrologically controlled indications.</p><p>10.3. In the case of hard copy the print or record shall also be easily legible and non-erasable.</p><p>10.4. A measuring instrument for direct sales trading transactions shall be designed to present the measurement result to both parties in the transaction when installed as intended. When critical in case of direct sales, any ticket provided to the consumer by an ancillary device not complying with the appropriate requirements of this Directive shall bear an appropriate restrictive information.</p><p>10.5. Whether or not a measuring instrument intended for utility measurement purposes can be remotely read it shall in any case be fitted with a metrologically controlled display accessible without tools to the consumer. The reading of this display is the measurement result that serves as the basis for the price to pay.</p><p>11. Further processing of data to conclude the trading transaction</p><p>11.1. A measuring instrument other than a utility measuring instrument shall record by a durable means the measurement result accompanied by information to identify the particular transaction, when:</p><p>- the measurement is non-repeatable and;</p><p>- the measuring instrument is normally intended for use in the absence of one of the trading parties.</p><p>11.2.

The taximeter shall be designed to calculate the distance and to measure the duration of a trip.</p><p>2. The taximeter shall be designed to calculate and display the fare, incrementing in steps equal to the resolution fixed by the Member State in the operation position &quot;Hired&quot;. The taximeter shall also be designed to display the final value for the trip in the operating position &quot;Stopped&quot;.</p><p>3. A taximeter shall be able to apply the normal calculation modes S and D. It shall be possible to choose between these calculation modes by a secured setting.</p><p>4. A taximeter shall be able to supply the following data through an appropriate secured interface(s):</p><p>- operation position: &quot;For Hire&quot;, &quot;Hired&quot; or &quot;Stopped&quot;;</p><p>- totaliser data according to paragraph 15.1;</p><p>- general information: constant of the distance signal generator, date of securing, taxi identifier, real time, identification of the tariff;</p><p>- fare information for a trip: total charged, fare, calculation of the fare, supplement charge, date, start time, finish time, distance travelled;</p><p>- tariff(s) information: parameters of tariff(s).</p><p>National legislation may require certain devices to be connected to the interface(s) of a taximeter.

The conditions for the compatibility between the taximeter and the distance signal generator shall be specified by the manufacturer of the taximeter.</p><p>11. If there is a supplement charge for an extra service, entered by the driver on manual command, this shall be excluded from the fare displayed. However, in that case a taximeter may display temporarily the value of the fare including the supplementary charge.</p><p>12. If the fare is calculated according to calculation mode D a taximeter may have an additional display mode in which only the total distance and duration of the trip are displayed in real time.</p><p>13.

If disconnected from power, a taximeter shall allow the totalised values to be stored for one year for the purpose of reading out the values from the taximeter to another medium.</p><p>15.3. Adequate measures shall be taken to prevent the display of totalised values from being used to deceive passengers.</p><p>16. Automatic change of tariffs is allowed due to the:</p><p>- distance of the trip;</p><p>- duration of the trip;</p><p>- time of the day;</p><p>- date;</p><p>- day of the week.</p><p>17.

It is determined with a reference standardised formula.</p><p>SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS</p><p>Instrument Classes</p><p>1. Two classes (0 and I) are being defined for exhaust gas analysers. The relevant minimum measuring ranges for these classes are shown in Table 1.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Classes and measuring ranges</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>Rated operating conditions</p><p>2.

The standard deviation of 20 measurements shall not be greater than one third of the modulus of the MPE for each applicable gas volume fraction.</p><p>8. For measuring CO, CO2 and HC, the instrument, including the specified gas handling system, must indicate 95 % of the final value as determined with calibration gases within 15 seconds after changing from a gas with zero content, e.g. fresh air. For measuring O2, the instrument under similar conditions must indicate a value differing less than 0,1 % vol from zero within 60 seconds after changing from fresh air to an oxygen-free gas.</p><p>9. The components in the exhaust gas, other than the components whose values are subject to the measurement, shall not affect the measurement results by more than the half of the modulus of the MPEs when those components are present in the following maximum volume fractions:</p><p>6 % vol CO,</p><p>16 % vol CO2,</p><p>10 % vol O2,</p><p>5 % vol H2,</p><p>0,3 % vol NO,</p><p>2000 ppm vol HC (as n-hexane),</p><p>water vapor up to saturation.</p><p>10. An exhaust gas analyser shall have an adjustment facility that provides operations for zero-setting, gas calibration and internal adjustment. The adjustment facility for zero-setting and internal adjustment shall be automatic.</p><p>11. For automatic or semi-automatic adjustment facilities, the instrument shall be unable to make a measurement as long as the adjustments have not been made.</p><p>12. An exhaust gas analyser shall detect hydrocarbon residues in the gas handling system. It shall not be possible to carry out a measurement if the hydrocarbon residues, present before any measurement, exceeds 20 ppm vol.</p><p>13. An exhaust gas analyser shall have a device for automatically recognising any malfunctioning of the sensor of the oxygen channel due to wear or a break in the connecting line.</p><p>14. If the exhaust gas analyser is capable to operate with different fuels (e.g. petrol or liquefied gas), there shall be the possibility to select the suitable coefficients for the Lambda calculation without ambiguity concerning the appropriate formula.</p><p>CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT</p><p>The conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 9 that the manufacturer can choose between are:</p><p>B + F or B + D or H1.</p><p></p><p>(1) OJ L 350, 28.12.1998, p. 17. </p>
