Human activities, but also climate change effects, natural hazards and shoreline dynamics such as erosion and accretion, can have severe impacts on coastal economic development and growth, as well as on marine ecosystems, leading to deterioration of environmental status, loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services. Due regard should be had to these various pressures in the establishment of maritime spatial plans. Moreover, healthy marine ecosystems and their multiple services, if integrated in planning decisions, can deliver substantial benefits in terms of food production, recreation and tourism, climate change mitigation and adaptation, shoreline dynamics control and disaster prevention.</p>

In addition, an ecosystem-based approach should be applied in a way that is adapted to the specific ecosystems and other specificities of the different marine regions and that takes into consideration the ongoing work in the Regional Sea Conventions, building on existing knowledge and experience. The approach will also allow for an adaptive management which ensures refinement and further development as experience and knowledge increase, taking into account the availability of data and information at sea basin level to implement that approach. Member States should take into account the precautionary principle and the principle that preventive action should be taken, as laid down in Article 191(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

Maritime spatial planning should aim to integrate the maritime dimension of some coastal uses or activities and their impacts and ultimately allow an integrated and strategic vision.</p>
