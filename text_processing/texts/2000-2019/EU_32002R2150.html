<p>Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 25 November 2002</p><p>on waste statistics</p><p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposals from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) Regular Community statistics on the production and management of waste from businesses and private households are required by the Community for monitoring the implementation of waste policy. This creates the basis for monitoring compliance with the principles of maximisation of recovery and safe disposal. Statistical instruments are still required, however, for assessing compliance with the principle of waste prevention and to establish a link between waste generation data and global, national and regional inventories of resource use.</p><p>(2) The terms for the description of waste and waste management need to be defined in order to ensure the comparability of results in waste statistics.</p><p>(3) Community waste policy has led to the establishment of a set of principles to be followed by waste-producing units and waste management. This requires the monitoring of waste at different points of the waste-stream generation, collection, recovery and disposal.</p><p>(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(4).</p><p>(5) To guarantee comparable results, waste statistics should be produced in accordance with the specified breakdown, in an appropriate form and within a fixed period of time from the end of the reference year.</p><p>(6) Since the objective of the proposed measure, namely to establish a framework for the production of Community statistics on the generation, recovery and disposal of waste, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, by reason of the need to define terms of description of waste and waste management so as to ensure the comparability of the statistics supplied by the Member States, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective of the proposed measure.</p><p>(7) Member States may need a transitional period for the establishment of their statistics on waste for all or some of the economic activities A, B and G to Q of NACE REV 1 as established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community(5) for which their national statistical system requires major adaptations.</p><p>(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).</p><p>(9) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted by the Commission,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>Objective</p><p>1. The objective of this Regulation is to establish a framework for the production of Community statistics on the generation, recovery and disposal of waste.</p><p>2. Member States and the Commission, within their respective fields of competence, shall produce Community statistics on the generation, recovery and disposal of waste, excluding radioactive waste, which is already covered by other legislation.</p><p>3. The statistics shall cover the following areas:</p><p>(a) Generation of waste according to Annex I;</p><p>(b) Recovery and disposal of waste according to Annex II;</p><p>(c) After the pilot studies according to Article 5: import and export of waste for which no data is collected under Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community(7), in accordance with Annex III.</p><p>4. In compiling the statistics, Member States and the Commission shall observe the mainly substance-oriented statistical nomenclature, as set out in Annex III.</p><p>5. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2), establish a table of equivalence between the statistical nomenclature of Annex III and the list of waste established by Commission Decision 2000/532/EC(8).</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes and within the framework of this Regulation:</p><p>(a) &quot;waste&quot; shall mean any substance or object as defined in Article 1(a) of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste(9);</p><p>(b) &quot;separately collected fractions of waste&quot; shall mean household and similar waste, selectively collected in homogeneous fractions by public services, non-profit organisations and private enterprises acting in the field of organised waste collection;</p><p>(c) &quot;recycling&quot; shall have the same meaning as in the definition given in Article 3(7) of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste(10);</p><p>(d) &quot;recovery&quot; shall mean any of the operations provided for in Annex II.B to Directive 75/442/EEC;</p><p>(e) &quot;disposal&quot; shall mean any of the operations provided for in Annex II.A to Directive 75/442/EEC;</p><p>(f) &quot;recovery or disposal facility&quot; shall mean a facility that requires a permit or registration pursuant to Articles 9, 10 or 11 of Directive 75/442/EC;</p><p>(g) &quot;hazardous waste&quot; shall mean any waste as defined in Article 1(4) of Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste(11);</p><p>(h) &quot;non-hazardous waste&quot; shall mean waste which is not covered by point (g);</p><p>(i) &quot;incineration&quot; shall mean thermal treatment of waste in an incineration plant as defined in Article 3(4) or a co-incineration plant as defined in Article 3(5) of Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste(12);</p><p>(j) &quot;landfill&quot; shall mean a waste disposal site as defined in Article 2(g) of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste(13);</p><p>(k) &quot;capacity of waste incineration facilities&quot; shall mean the maximum capacity to incinerate waste, in tonnes per annum or in gigajoules;</p><p>(l) &quot;capacity of waste recycling facilities&quot; shall mean the maximum capacity to recycle waste, in tonnes per annum;</p><p>(m) &quot;capacity of landfills&quot; shall mean the remaining capacity (at the end of the data reference year) of the landfill facility to dispose of waste in the future, measured in cubic metres;</p><p>(n) &quot;capacity of other disposal facilities&quot; shall mean the capacity of the facility to dispose of waste, measured in tonnes per annum.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>Collection of data</p><p>1.
