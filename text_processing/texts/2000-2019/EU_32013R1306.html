In the light of the debate on that Communication, the CAP should be reformed with effect from 1 January 2014. That reform should cover all the main instruments of the CAP, including Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 <a id="ntc2-L_2013347EN.01054901-E0002" href="#ntr2-L_2013347EN.01054901-E0002"

Experience derived from implementing that Regulation shows that certain elements of the financing and monitoring mechanism need to be adjusted. In view of the scope of the reform, it is appropriate to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and to replace it with a new text. The reform should also, as far as possible, harmonise, streamline and simplify its provisions.</p>

That empowerment should also cover derogations from the ineligibility of payments made by the paying agencies to the beneficiaries before the earliest or the latest possible date of payment and the compensation between expenditure and revenues under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). In addition, that empowerment should cover the methods applicable to the commitments and the payment of the amounts if the Union's budget has not been adopted by the beginning of the financial year or if the total amount of the commitments scheduled exceeds the threshold laid down in Article 170(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc3-L_2013347EN.01054901-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_2013347EN.01054901-E0003"

That empowerment should additionally cover the suspension of monthly payments or interim payments for which the relevant statistical information has not been sent in time, the specific obligations to be complied with by Member States with regard to checks, the criteria and methodology for applying corrections in the context of the conformity clearance procedure and the recovery of debts. Moreover, that empowerment should cover requirements with respect to customs procedures, the withdrawals of aid and penalties in the case of non-compliance with the eligibility conditions and commitments or other obligations resulting from the application of sectoral agricultural legislation. Likewise, that empowerment should cover market measures for which the Commission may suspend monthly payments, rules on securities, on the functioning of the integrated administration and control system as well as the measures excluded from the scrutiny of transactions. Similarly, that empowerment should cover the modification of the sum of the receipts or payments below which the commercial document of undertakings should normally not be scrutinised pursuant to this Regulation, the penalties applied under cross-compliance, the control requirements in the wine sector and the rules on maintenance of permanent pasture. Lastly, that empowerment should cover the rules on the operative event and the exchange rate to be used by the Member States not using the euro, measures to safeguard the application of Union law if exceptional monetary practices related to national currency are likely to jeopardise it, in respect of the content of the common monitoring and evaluation framework of the measures adopted under the CAP and in respect of transitional measures.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.

Since those measures have certain elements in common, but do also differ in a number of respects, the provisions on their financing should be dealt with in the same set of provisions.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 provides for reductions and suspensions of monthly or interim payments for the Funds. Despite the rather broad wording of those provisions, in practice they are used essentially to reduce payments for non-compliance with payment deadlines, ceilings and similar "accounting issues" which can readily be detected in the declarations of expenditure. Those provisions also allow reductions and suspensions in case of serious and persistent deficiencies in national control systems. The imposition of such reductions and suspensions are, however, made subject to rather restrictive substantive conditions for doing so and providing for a special, two-step procedure to be followed. The European Parliament and the Council have repeatedly asked the Commission to suspend payments to non-compliant Member States. For these reasons, it is necessary to clarify the system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 for reductions and suspensions and to merge the rules on reductions and suspensions for both the Funds into one single Article. The system of reductions for "accounting issues" should be maintained in line with the existing administrative practice. The possibility of reducing or suspending payments where there are significant and persistent deficiencies in national control systems should be reinforced in order to provide the Commission with the possibility of suspending payments rapidly when serious deficiencies are detected. That possibility should also be extended to include negligence in the system for recovery of irregular payments.</p>

The control statistics are an important source of information for the Commission to satisfy itself as to the correct management of the Funds and are an essential element of the annual declaration of assurance. Given the vital nature of the control statistics and in order to ensure that Member States respect their obligation to send it in time, it is necessary to provide a deterrent for late provision of the data required which is proportionate to the extent of the data deficit. Therefore, provisions should be put in place to allow the Commission to suspend part of the monthly or interim payments in respect of which the relevant statistical information has not been sent in time.</p>

Member States should be given the right to justify their decisions to make payments and should have recourse to conciliation where there is no common agreement between them and the Commission. In order to give Member States legal and financial assurances as to expenditure effected in the past, a maximum period should be set for the Commission to decide which financial consequences should follow from non-compliance. As regards the EAFRD, the conformity clearance procedure should be in line with the provisions on the financial corrections by the Commission as laid down in Part 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.</p>

In order to allow sufficient time for all the necessary administrative proceedings, including internal checks, Member States should request recovery from the beneficiary within 18 months after a control report or similar document, stating that an irregularity has taken place, has been approved and, where applicable, received by the paying agency or body responsible for the recovery. Provision should be made for a system of financial responsibility where irregularities have been committed and where the total amount has not been recovered. In this respect a procedure should be established enabling the Commission to safeguard the interests of the Union budget by deciding on partial charging to the Member State concerned of the sums lost as a result of irregularities and not recovered within a reasonable period. In certain cases of negligence by the Member State, it is also right to charge the full sum to the Member State concerned. However, subject to Member States complying with obligations under their internal procedures, the financial burden should be divided fairly between the Union and the Member State. The same rules should apply to the EAFRD, subject however, to the requirement that sums recovered or cancelled following irregularities should remain available to the approved rural development programmes of the Member State concerned as those sums have been allocated to that Member State. Provisions on the reporting obligation for Member States should also be established.</p>

Cross-compliance aims to contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture through better awareness on the part of beneficiaries of the need to respect those basic standards. It aims also to contribute to make the CAP more compatible with the expectation of society through improving consistency of that policy with the environment, public health, animal health, plant health and animal welfare policies. The cross-compliance system forms an integral part of the CAP and should therefore be maintained. Its scope, however, which consists so far in separate lists of statutory management requirements and standards of good agricultural and environmental condition of land should be streamlined so that consistency of the cross-compliance system is ensured and made more visible. For this purpose, the requirements and standards should be organised in a single list and grouped by areas and issues. Experience has also shown that a number of the requirements within the scope of cross-compliance are not sufficiently relevant to farming activity or the area of the holding or concern national authorities rather than beneficiaries. Consequently, that scope should be adjusted. Provision should furthermore be made for the maintenance of permanent pasture in 2015 and 2016.</p>

Those penalties should be proportionate, effective and dissuasive. Such penalties should be without prejudice to other penalties laid down under Union or national law. For the sake of consistency, it is appropriate to merge the relevant Union provisions into one single legal instrument. For farmers participating in the small farmers scheme referred to in Title V of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, the efforts to be made under the cross-compliance system might be considered to exceed the benefit of keeping those farmers under that system. For reasons of simplification, those farmers should therefore be exempted from cross-compliance and in particular from its control system and from the risk of cross-compliance penalties. However, that exemption should be without prejudice to the obligation to respect the applicable provisions of the sectoral law or to the possibility to be checked and to be imposed penalties under that law.</p>

Those standards of good agricultural and environmental condition of the land aim to contribute to preventing soil erosion, maintaining soil organic matter and soil structure, ensuring a minimum level of maintenance, avoiding the deterioration of habitats and protecting and managing water. The wider scope of the cross-compliance system as laid down in this Regulation should therefore include a framework within which Member States are to adopt national standards of good agricultural and environmental condition.

In this context a list of indicators should be determined and the performance of the CAP should be assessed by the Commission in relation to the policy objectives of viable food production, the sustainable management of natural resources and climate action and balanced territorial development. In assessing, in particular, the performance of the CAP in relation to the objective of viable food production, all relevant factors, including the evolution of input prices, should be taken into account. The Commission should set up a framework for a common monitoring and evaluation system ensuring inter alia that relevant data, including information from Member States is available on a timely manner. In so doing it should take account of the data needs and of the synergies between potential data sources. Moreover, the Commission Communication on A Budget for Europe 2020 - Part II stated that the climate related expenditure in the overall Union budget should increase to at least 20 %, with contributions from different policies. The Commission should therefore be able to assess the impact of the Union's support within the framework of the CAP, for climate objectives.</p>

As the structures of the Member States' agricultural economies vary considerably and may differ significantly from the average Union farm structure, the application of different minimum thresholds that reflect the particular situation of the Member States should be allowed. Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 sets out a simple and specific scheme for small farms. Article 63 of that Regulation lays down criteria for calculating the amount of aid. For reasons of consistency, in the case of Member States applying the scheme, the threshold to be taken into account should be set at the same level as the amounts fixed by the Member State as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 63(1) or the second subparagraph of Article 63(2) of that Regulation. In the case of Member States deciding not to apply that scheme, the threshold to be taken into account should be set at the same level as the maximum amount of aid possible under the scheme, as provided for in Article 63 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. Below that specific threshold 1307the publication should contain all the relevant information, except for the name, in order to allow the taxpayers to have an accurate image of the CAP.</p>

It enables citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making process and guarantees that the administration enjoys greater legitimacy, and is more effective and is more accountable to the citizen. It also brings concrete examples of the provision of "public goods" by farming to the attention of citizens, thereby underpinning the legitimacy of state support for the agricultural sector.</p>
