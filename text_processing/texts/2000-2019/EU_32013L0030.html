Those best practices also require an assessment of the likelihood and consequences and therefore the risk of major accidents, and also the measures necessary to prevent them and the measures necessary for emergency response, should a major accident nonetheless occur. The risk assessments and arrangements for major accident prevention should be clearly described and compiled in the report on major hazards. The report on major hazards should be complementary to the safety and health document referred to in Directive 92/91/EEC. The workers should be consulted at the relevant stages of the preparation of the report on major hazards.

Therefore, all Member States, including the landlocked Member States and the Member States with offshore waters which do not have offshore oil and gas operations or licensing activities, should require reports on major accidents occurring outside the Union which involve companies registered in their territory, and should share this information at Union level. The reporting requirement should not interfere with emergency response or the legal proceedings relating to an accident. Instead they should focus on the relevance of the accident for further developing the safety of offshore oil and gas operations in the Union.</p>

                  <span>The Commission regrets that under paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 41 some Member States are partially exempted from the obligation to transpose the Directive and considers that such derogations shall not be regarded as a precedent in order not to affect the integrity of EU law.</span>

               <span>The Commission notes that Member States may use the option not to transpose and apply Article 20 of the Directive because of the current absence of any company registered in their jurisdiction which has offshore activities outside the territory of the Union.</span>
               <p class="oj-normal">In order to ensure effective enforcement of this Directive, the Commission underlines that it is incumbent on these Member States to ensure that companies already registered with them do not circumvent the aims of the Directive by extending their business objects to include offshore activities without notification of this extension to the competent national authorities so that they can take the necessary steps to ensure full application of Article 20.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">The Commission will take all necessary measures against any circumvention which may be brought to its attention.</p>
