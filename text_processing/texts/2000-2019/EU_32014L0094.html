Synthetic paraffinic diesel fuels, such as hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO) and Fischer-Tropsch diesel, are fungible and can be blended into fossil diesel fuel at very high blending ratios, or can be used neat in all existing or future diesel vehicles. Therefore, those fuels can be distributed, stored and used with the existing infrastructure. Synthetic fuels substituting petrol, such as methanol and other alcohols, can be blended with petrol and can be technically used with current vehicle technology with minor adaptions. Methanol can also be used for inland navigation and short-sea shipping. Synthetic and paraffinic fuels have a potential to reduce the use of oil sources in the energy supply to transport.</p>

Bio-LPG derived from various biomass sources is expected to emerge as a viable technology in the medium to long term. LPG can be used for road transport (for cars and trucks) for all ranges of distances. It can also be used for inland navigation and short-sea shipping. LPG infrastructure is relatively well developed, with a significant number of filling stations already present in the Union (approximately 29 000). However, the distribution of those filling stations is uneven, with low penetration in a number of countries.</p>

Coordinated policy frameworks of all Member States should therefore provide the long-term security required for private and public investment in vehicle and fuel technology, and infrastructure build-up, in order to serve the dual purpose of minimising dependence on oil and mitigating the environmental impact of transport. Member States should therefore establish national policy frameworks outlining their national targets and objectives, and supporting actions for the development of the market as regards alternative fuels, including the deployment of the necessary infrastructure to be put into place, in close cooperation with regional and local authorities and with the industry concerned, while taking into account the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. Where necessary, Member States should cooperate with other neighbouring Member States at regional or macro-regional level, by means of consultation or joint policy frameworks, in particular where continuity of alternative fuels infrastructure coverage across national borders or the construction of new infrastructure in the proximity of national borders is required, including different non-discriminatory access options for recharging and refuelling points. The coordination of those national policy frameworks and their coherence at Union level should be supported by cooperation between Member States and assessment and reporting by the Commission. In order to facilitate reporting by the Member States of the information provided for in Annex I, non-binding guidelines should be adopted by the Commission.</p>

In the long term, this may also enable electric vehicles to feed power from the batteries back into the grid at times of high general electricity demand. Intelligent metering systems as defined in Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc10-L_2014307EN.01000101-E0010" href="#ntr10-L_2014307EN.01000101-E0010"

Intelligent metering systems provide accurate and transparent information on the cost and availability of recharging services, thereby encouraging recharging at ‘off-peak’ periods, which means times of low general electricity demand and low energy prices. The use of intelligent metering systems optimises recharging, with benefits for the electricity system and for consumers.</p>

The quality of natural gas used in the Union depends on its origin, on its constituents, for example biomethane blended into natural gas, and on the way in which natural gas is handled through the distribution chain. Therefore, a spread of technical characteristics could prevent the optimal use of engines and reduce their energy efficiency. In this respect, the Technical Committee CEN/TC 408 — Project Committee is developing a set of quality specifications for natural gas used in transport and for the injection of biomethane into the natural gas grid.</p>
