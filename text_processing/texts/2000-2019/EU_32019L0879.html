The objective of the TLAC standard is to ensure that global systemically important banks, referred to as global systemically important institutions (‘G-SIIs’) in the Union framework, have the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity necessary to help ensure that, in, and immediately following, a resolution, those institutions can continue to perform critical functions without putting taxpayers' funds, that is public funds, or financial stability at risk. In its Communication of 24 November 2015, ‘Towards the completion of the Banking Union’, the Commission committed itself to bringing forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2016 that would enable the TLAC standard to be implemented in Union law by the internationally agreed deadline of 2019.</p>

The absence of harmonised Union rules also results in distortions of competition in the internal market given that the costs for institutions and entities to comply with the existing requirements and the TLAC standard might differ considerably across the Union. It is therefore necessary to remove those obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and to avoid distortions of competition resulting from the absence of harmonised Union rules in respect of the implementation of the TLAC standard. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Directive is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In line with the TLAC standard, Directive 2014/59/EU should continue to recognise both the Single Point of Entry (SPE) resolution strategy and the Multiple Point of Entry (MPE) resolution strategy. Under the SPE resolution strategy, only one group entity, usually the parent undertaking, is resolved, whereas other group entities, usually operating subsidiaries, are not put under resolution, but transfer their losses and recapitalisation needs to the entity to be resolved. Under the MPE resolution strategy, more than one group entity might be resolved. A clear identification of entities to be resolved (‘resolution entities’), that is, the entities to which resolution actions could be applied, together with subsidiaries that belong to them (‘resolution groups’), is important in order to apply the desired resolution strategy effectively. That identification is also relevant for determining the level of application of the rules on loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity that institutions and entities should apply. It is therefore necessary to introduce the concepts of ‘resolution entity’ and ‘resolution group’ and to amend Directive 2014/59/EU as regards group resolution planning, in order to explicitly require resolution authorities to identify the resolution entities and resolution groups within a group and to appropriately consider the implications of any planned action within the group to ensure effective group resolution.</p>

In particular, certain debt instruments with an embedded derivative component, such as certain structured notes, should be eligible, subject to certain conditions, to meet the MREL to the extent that they have a fixed or increasing principal amount repayable at maturity that is known in advance while only an additional return is linked to that derivative component and depends on the performance of a reference asset. In view of those conditions, those debt instruments are expected to be highly loss-absorbing and easy to bail-in in resolution. Where institutions or entities hold own funds in excess of own funds requirements, that fact should not in itself affect decisions concerning the determination of the MREL. Moreover, it should be possible for institutions and entities to meet any part of their MREL with own funds.</p>

To take account of the specificities of such cooperative networks, resolution authorities should also be able to waive the application of the MREL that applies to such credit institutions and the central body under similar conditions to those set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 where credit institutions and the central body are established in the same Member State. Resolution authorities should also be able to treat credit institutions and the central body as a whole when assessing the conditions for resolution depending on the features of the solidarity mechanism. Resolution authorities should be able to ensure compliance with the external MREL requirement of the resolution group as a whole in different ways, depending on the features of the solidarity mechanism of each group, by counting eligible liabilities of entities that, in accordance with the resolution plan, are required by the resolution authorities to issue instruments eligible for the MREL outside the resolution group.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The requirement to include contractual recognition of the effects of the bail-in tool in agreements or instruments creating liabilities governed by the laws of third countries should facilitate and improve the process for bailing in those liabilities in the event of resolution. Contractual arrangements, when properly drafted and widely adopted, can offer a workable solution in cases of cross-border resolution until a statutory approach under Union law is developed or incentives to choose the law of a Member State for contracts are developed or statutory recognition frameworks to enable effective cross-border resolution are adopted in all third-country jurisdictions. Even with statutory recognition frameworks in place, contractual recognition arrangements should help to reinforce the awareness of creditors under contractual arrangements that are not governed by the law of a Member State of possible resolution action with regard to institutions or entities that are governed by Union law. There might be instances, however, where it is impracticable for institutions or entities to include those contractual terms in agreements or instruments creating certain liabilities, in particular liabilities that are not excluded from the bail-in tool under Directive 2014/59/EU, covered deposits or own funds instruments.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">For example, under certain circumstances, it could be considered impracticable to include contractual recognition clauses in liability contracts in cases where it is illegal under the law of the third country for an institution or entity to include such clauses in agreements or instruments creating liabilities that are governed by the laws of that third country, where an institution or entity has no power at the individual level to amend the contractual terms as they are imposed by international protocols or are based on internationally agreed standard terms, or where the liability which would be subject to the contractual recognition requirement is contingent on a breach of contract or arises from guarantees, counter-guarantees or other instruments used in the context of trade finance operations. However, a refusal by the counterparty to agree to be bound by a contractual bail-in recognition clause should not as such be considered as a cause of impracticability. EBA should develop draft regulatory technical standards to be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to more precisely identify cases of impracticability. When applying those regulatory technical standards and taking into account the specificities of the market concerned, the resolution authority should specify, where it deems it necessary, categories of liabilities where there might be grounds for impracticability. In that framework, it should be for an institution or an entity to determine whether the insertion of a bail-in recognition clause in a contract or class of contracts is impracticable. Institutions and entities should provide regular updates to resolution authorities, to keep them informed of progress towards implementing contractual recognition terms.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">In this context, institutions and entities should indicate the contracts or classes of contracts for which the insertion of a bail-in recognition clause is impracticable and indicate a reason for this assessment. Resolution authorities should, within a reasonable timeframe, assess an institution's or an entity's determination that it is impracticable to include contractual recognition clauses in liability contracts and act to address any erroneous assessments and impediments to resolvability as a result of contractual recognition clauses not being included. Institutions and entities should be prepared to justify their determination if requested by the resolution authority to do so. In addition, in order to ensure that the resolvability of institutions and entities is not affected, liabilities for which the relevant contractual provisions are not included should not be eligible for the MREL.</p>

In that context, resolution authorities should be able to exercise that power if they are not satisfied with a proposed private sector measure that is immediately available. The power to suspend certain contractual obligations would also allow resolution authorities to establish whether a resolution action is in the public interest, to choose the most appropriate resolution tools, or to ensure the effective application of one or more resolution tools. The duration of the suspension should be limited to a maximum of two business days. Up to that maximum, the suspension could continue to apply after the resolution decision is taken.</p>

Directive 98/26/EC reduces the risk associated with participation in payment and securities settlement systems, in particular by reducing disruption in the event of the insolvency of a participant in such a system. To ensure that those protections apply appropriately in crisis situations, whilst maintaining appropriate certainty for operators of payment and securities systems and other market participants, Directive 2014/59/EU should be amended to provide that a crisis prevention measure, a suspension of obligation under Article 33a or a crisis management measure should not as such be deemed to constitute insolvency proceedings within the meaning of Directive 98/26/EC, provided that the substantive obligations under the contract continue to be performed. However, nothing in Directive 2014/59/EU should prejudice the operation of a system designated under Directive 98/26/EC or the right to collateral security guaranteed by that Directive.</p>

In the absence of a statutory cross-border recognition framework, Member States should require the institutions and entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU to include a contractual term in relevant financial contracts recognising that the contract may be subject to the exercise of powers by resolution authorities to suspend certain payment and delivery obligations, to restrict the enforcement of security interests or to temporarily suspend termination rights and to be bound by the requirements of Article 68 as if the financial contract was governed by the law of the relevant Member State. Such an obligation should be provided to the extent that the contract falls within the scope of those provisions. Therefore, the obligation to insert the contractual clause does not arise with respect to Articles 33a, 69, 70 and 71 of Directive 2014/59/EU as amended by this Directive in, for example, contracts with central counterparties or operators of systems designated for the purposes of Directive 98/26/EC, since with respect to these contracts, even when they are governed by the law of the relevant Member State, resolution authorities do not have the powers in those Articles.</p>

Recital (7) of that Directive clarifies that Member States have the option to apply the provisions of that Directive to their domestic institutions which participate directly in systems governed by the law of a third country and to collateral security provided in connection with the participation in such systems. In view of the global size of, and activities within, some systems governed by the laws of a third country and the increased participation of entities established in the Union in such systems, the Commission should review how the Member States apply the option envisaged in recital (7) of that Directive and assess the need for any further amendments to that Directive with regard to such systems.</p>

Partial recognition could be a result, for example, of the application of grandfathering provisions which partly derecognise an instrument or a result of the application of the amortisation calendar laid down for Tier 2 instruments in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.</p>
