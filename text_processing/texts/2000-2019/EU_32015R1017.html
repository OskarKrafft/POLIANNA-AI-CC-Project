                           <p class="oj-normal">The economic and financial crisis has led to a lowering of the level of investments within the Union. Investment has fallen by approximately 15 % since its peak in 2007. The Union suffers in particular from a lack of investment as a consequence of fiscal constraints on Member States and from sluggish growth, thereby resulting in market uncertainty regarding the economic future. That lack of investment, which has been particularly severe in those Member States most affected by the crisis, has slowed down economic recovery and negatively affects job creation, long-term growth prospects and competitiveness, potentially preventing the attainment of the targets and objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. There is a need to strengthen the attractiveness of investing in Europe and in the infrastructure of a modern knowledge economy.</p>

Together with a renewed impetus towards investment financing, structural reforms that are effective and economically and socially sustainable, as well as fiscal responsibility, constitute means of establishing a virtuous circle in which investment projects help support employment and demand and lead to a sustained reduction of the output gap as well as to an increase in growth potential. A European fund for strategic investments (EFSI), strengthened by Member State contributions, must be a complement to an overall strategy to improve Union competitiveness and attract investment.</p>

In addition, Member States should undertake additional activities such as customised training programmes to match the skills of workers to the needs of sectors benefiting from the EFSI, tailor-made business services for enterprises to prepare them to expand and create more jobs, as well as support for start-ups and self-employed individuals.</p>

The strategy has three pillars: mobilising finance for investment, making investment reach the real economy and improving the investment environment in the Union. The strategy should boost competitiveness and economic recovery and should be complementary to the objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion across the Union. The EFSI should be seen as a complement to all other actions needed to reduce the investment gaps in the Union and – by acting as a guarantee fund – as a stimulus for new investments.</p>

The Commission and the Member States should embark on that task without delay. The work of the EFSI, and investments across the Union generally, should benefit from that accompanying work.</p>

Those investments should also include projects of common interest in the urban and rural development and social fields and in the environmental and natural resources fields; projects which strengthen the Union's scientific and technological base and foster benefits for society as well as better exploitation of the economic and industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development, including research infrastructure, and pilot and demonstration facilities; and projects relating to human capital, culture and health. Market-based incentives and the additionality provided by the EFSI should ensure that the EFSI targets socially and economically viable projects without any sectoral or regional pre-allocation, in particular to address high investment needs or market failures.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">At the same time, the EFSI should be able to support environmentally sound projects and benefit industries and technologies with high growth potential and contribute to the transformation into a green, sustainable and resource-efficient economy. By overcoming the Union's current investment difficulties and reducing regional disparities, the EFSI should seek to contribute to strengthening the Union's competitiveness, research and innovation potential, economic, social and territorial cohesion, and to supporting an energy- and resource-efficient transition, including as regards infrastructure transition, towards a sustainable, renewable-based circular economy, through the creation of stable and fairly remunerated jobs. The EFSI should target projects of any size that promote quality job creation, short-, medium- and long-term sustainable growth and competitiveness, in particular where such projects have the highest incremental value, thereby contributing to achieving the Union's policy objectives in accordance with Article 9 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). For the purpose of reaching the general objectives set out in this Regulation, the EFSI should contribute to achieving the objectives set out in Articles 170, 173 and 179 TFEU and Article 194(1) TFEU.</p>

In order to ensure that the EFSI fulfils its purpose of leveraging private investments, delivering jobs, fostering resilient economic developments, and reducing macro-economic imbalances, a special focus on energy efficiency is needed. The EFSI should support projects in accordance with the Union's energy, climate and efficiency targets laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the 2030 Framework for climate and energy policies and which aim to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>

Such a wide range of products should allow the EFSI to adapt to market needs whilst encouraging private investment in projects. The EFSI should not be a substitute for private market finance or products provided by national promotional banks or institutions but should instead act as a catalyst for private finance by addressing market failures so as to ensure the most effective and strategic use of public money and should act as a means of further enhancing cohesion across the Union.</p>

It is expected that when the EU guarantee is combined with EUR 5 000 000 000 to be provided by the EIB, the EFSI support should generate EUR 60 800 000 000 of additional investment by the EIB and the EIF. The amount of EUR 60 800 000 000 supported by the EFSI is expected to further generate a total of EUR 315 000 000 000 in investment in the Union within three years of the date of entry into force of this Regulation. The participation of Member States in the implementation of the Investment Plan is desirable to increase its impact.

That report should specify whether the EFSI is achieving its objectives and whether a dedicated scheme supporting investment in the Union is warranted. In particular, the report should assess the achievement of the general objectives laid down in this Regulation, the mobilisation of private capital, as well as include an assessment of the additionality provided by the EFSI, of the risk profile of operations supported by the EFSI and of the macro-economic impact of the EFSI, including its impact on growth and employment. If the report concludes that maintaining a scheme for supporting investments is warranted, the Commission should, where appropriate, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council to amend this Regulation, in particular with a view to setting a new investment period, ensuring continuation of investment and appropriate financing. If the report concludes that the EFSI is not achieving its objectives and that maintaining a scheme for supporting investment is not warranted, the Commission should, where appropriate, submit a proposal to ensure a smooth termination of the EFSI while preserving the EU guarantee for the operations already approved under this Regulation.</p>

Often this is because private investors are not aware of the projects or have insufficient information to make an assessment of the investment risks, including regulatory risks. The Commission with the support of the EIB should promote the creation of a transparent portal of current and future projects in the Union which are suitable for investment (European investment project portal - EIPP). The EIPP should ensure that information regarding investment projects is made publicly available on a regular and structured basis so as to ensure that investors have access to transparent and reliable information with due regard to the protection of business secrets.</p>

Projects supported by the EFSI shall typically have a higher risk profile than projects supported by EIB normal operations and the EFSI portfolio shall have overall a higher risk profile than the portfolio of investments supported by the EIB under its normal investment policies before the entry into force of this Regulation.</p>

When carrying out that adjustment, the Steering Board shall avoid an approach which would be riskier than necessary.</p>
