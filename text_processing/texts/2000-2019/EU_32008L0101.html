The latest scientific findings reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report demonstrate even more clearly that the negative impacts of climate change are increasingly posing a serious risk to ecosystems, food production and the attainment of sustainable development and of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as to human health and security. Keeping the 2 °C objective within reach requires stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in line with about 450 ppmv CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> equivalent, which requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak within the next 10 to 15 years and substantial global emission reductions to at least 50 % below 1990 levels by 2050.</p>

It endorsed a 30 % reduction in the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 as its contribution to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and economically more advanced developing countries to contributing adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities. The EU is continuing to take the lead in the negotiation of an ambitious international agreement that will achieve the objective of limiting the global temperature increase to 2 °C and is encouraged by the progress made towards this objective at the 13th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Bali in December 2007. The EU will seek to ensure that such a global agreement includes measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and, in this event, the Commission should consider which amendments to this Directive as it applies to aircraft operators are necessary.</p>

Member States continue to support work with other States in the ICAO on the development of measures, including market-based instruments, to address the climate change impacts of aviation. At the sixth meeting of the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection in 2004, it was agreed that an aviation-specific emissions trading system based on a new legal instrument under ICAO auspices seemed sufficiently unattractive that it should not then be pursued further. Consequently, Resolution A35-5 of the ICAO’s 35th Assembly held in September 2004 did not propose a new legal instrument but instead endorsed open emissions trading and the possibility for States to incorporate emissions from international aviation into their emissions trading schemes. Appendix L to Resolution A36-22 of the ICAO’s 36th Assembly held in September 2007 urges Contracting States not to implement an emissions trading system on other Contracting States’ aircraft operators except on the basis of mutual agreement between those States. Recalling that the Chicago Convention recognises expressly the right of each Contracting Party to apply on a non-discriminatory basis its own air laws and regulations to the aircraft of all States, the Member States of the European Community and fifteen other European States placed a reservation on this resolution and reserved the right under the Chicago Convention to enact and apply market-based measures on a non-discriminatory basis to all aircraft operators of all States providing services to, from or within their territory.</p>

As part of a comprehensive package of measures, the strategy proposed the inclusion of aviation in the Community scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading and provided for the creation of a multi-stakeholder working group on aviation as part of the second phase of the European Climate Change Programme to consider ways of including aviation in the Community scheme. In its Conclusions of 2 December 2005, the Council recognised that, from an economic and environmental point of view, the inclusion of the aviation sector in the Community scheme seemed to be the best way forward and called on the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006. In its resolution of 4 July 2006 on reducing the climate change impact of aviation <a id="ntc9-L_2009008EN.01000301-E0009" href="#ntr9-L_2009008EN.01000301-E0009"

The Community scheme may serve as a model for the use of emissions trading worldwide. The Community and its Member States should continue to be in contact with third parties during the implementation of this Directive and to encourage third countries to take equivalent measures. If a third country adopts measures, which have an environmental effect at least equivalent to that of this Directive, to reduce the climate impact of flights to the Community, the Commission should consider the options available in order to provide for optimal interaction between the Community scheme and that country’s measures, after consulting with that country. Emissions trading schemes being developed in third countries are beginning to provide for optimal interaction with the Community scheme in relation to their coverage of aviation. Bilateral arrangements on linking the Community scheme with other trading schemes to form a common scheme or taking account of equivalent measures to avoid double regulation could constitute a step towards global agreement. Where such bilateral arrangements are made, the Commission may amend the types of aviation activities included in the Community scheme, including consequential adjustments to the total quantity of allowances to be issued to aircraft operators.</p>

The IPCC has estimated that the total climate impact of aviation is currently two to four times higher than the effect of its past carbon dioxide emissions alone. Recent Community research indicates that the total climate impact of aviation could be around two times higher than the impact of carbon dioxide alone. However, none of these estimates takes into account the highly uncertain cirrus cloud effects. In accordance with Article 174(2) of the Treaty, Community environment policy is to be based on the precautionary principle. Pending scientific progress, all impacts of aviation should be addressed to the extent possible. Emissions of nitrogen oxides will be addressed in other legislation to be proposed by the Commission in 2008. Research on the formation of contrails and cirrus clouds and effective mitigation measures, including operational and technical measures, should be promoted.</p>

Decisions on national public expenditure are a matter for Member States, in line with the principle of subsidiarity. Without prejudice to that position, revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances, or an equivalent amount where required by overriding budgetary principles of the Member States, such as unity and universality, should be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the impacts of climate change in the EU and third countries, to fund research and development for mitigation and adaptation and to cover the cost of administering the Community scheme. Revenues generated from auctioning should also be used on low-emission transport. The proceeds of auctioning should in particular be used to fund contributions to the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, and measures to avoid deforestation and facilitate adaptation in developing countries. The provisions of this Directive relating to the use of revenues should not prejudge any decision on the use to be made of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances in the broader context of the general review of Directive 2003/87/EC.</p>
