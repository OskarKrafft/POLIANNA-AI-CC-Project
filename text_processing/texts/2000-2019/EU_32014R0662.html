The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council, as well as their consistency with internationally agreed accounting requirements, a joint fulfilment agreement concluded between the Union, its Member States and third countries under Articles 3 and 4 of the Kyoto Protocol, and relevant Union legislation.</p>
