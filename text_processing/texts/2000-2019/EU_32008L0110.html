According to the CUV (Uniform Rules concerning Contracts of Use of Vehicles in International Rail Traffic) appended thereto, wagon keepers are no longer obliged to register their wagons with a railway undertaking. The former ‘Regolamento Internazionale Veicoli’ (RIV) Agreement between railway undertakings has ceased to apply and was partially replaced by a new private and voluntary agreement (General Contract of Use for Wagons, GCU) between railway undertakings and wagon keepers whereby the latter are in charge of the maintenance of their wagons. In order to reflect these changes and to facilitate the implementation of Directive 2004/49/EC as far as safety certification of railway undertakings is concerned, the concept of the ‘keeper’ and the concept of ‘entity in charge of maintenance’ should be defined, as well as the specification of the relationship between these entities and railway undertakings.</p>

Many entities can be identified as a keeper of a vehicle, for example, the owner, a company making business out of a fleet of wagons, a company leasing vehicles to a railway undertaking, a railway undertaking or an infrastructure manager using vehicles for maintaining its infrastructure. These entities have the control over the vehicle with a view to its use as a means of transport by the railway undertakings and the infrastructure managers. In order to avoid any doubt, the keeper should be clearly identified in the National Vehicle Register (NVR) provided for in Article 33 of the Railway Interoperability Directive.</p>

As a result of the entry into force of this Directive there is a need to ensure coherence between these TSIs and the certification requirements for the entity in charge of maintenance to be adopted by the Commission. The Commission will achieve this by modifying, where appropriate, the relevant TSIs using the procedure envisaged by the Railway Interoperability Directive.</p>
