It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">In order to adapt Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 to technical progress and to the evolution of international law, and to ensure better reporting, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend Annexes II and III to that Regulation to adapt them to scientific or technical progress or as a result of the adoption by the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol of any amendment of the Annexes to the UNECE Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers, as well as to supplement that Regulation by initiating reporting on releases of relevant pollutants from one or more diffuse sources. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">In order to adapt Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 to technological and economic developments and to align NACE Rev. 2 with other economic and social classifications, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend Annex I to that Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Accordingly, Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 is amended as follows:</p>

As the technical details and characteristics of the devices for electronic receipt should be kept up to date with technological developments, it is also necessary to empower the Commission to amend the technical details and characteristics of devices for electronic receipt. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making.

            <p class="oj-normal">In order to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend Annexes II and III to that Regulation and to supplement that Regulation in respect of the use of substances other than potable water to remove surface contamination from products of animal origin, in respect of amendments of the special guarantees relating to the placing of certain food of animal origin on the market in Sweden or Finland and in respect of derogations from Annexes II and III to that Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Accordingly, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 is amended as follows:</p>
