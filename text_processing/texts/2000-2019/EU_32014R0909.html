Playing an important role in the securities holding systems through which their participants report the securities holdings of investors, the securities settlement systems operated by CSDs also serve as an essential tool to control the integrity of an issue, hindering the undue creation or reduction of issued securities, and thereby play an important role in maintaining investor confidence. Moreover, securities settlement systems operated by CSDs are closely involved in securing collateral for monetary policy operations as well as in securing collateral between credit institutions and are, therefore, important actors in the collateralisation process.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The increasing number of cross-border settlements as a consequence of the development of link agreements between CSDs calls into question the resilience, in the absence of common prudential rules, of CSDs when importing the risks encountered by CSDs from other Member States. Moreover, despite the increase in cross-border settlements, market-driven changes towards a more integrated market for CSD services have proven to be very slow. An open internal market in securities settlement should allow any investor in the Union to invest in all Union securities with the same ease as in, and using the same processes as for, domestic securities. However, the settlement markets in the Union remain fragmented across national borders and cross-border settlement remains more costly, due to different national rules regulating settlement and the activities of CSDs and limited competition between CSDs. That fragmentation hinders and creates additional risks and costs for cross-border settlement. Given the systemic relevance of CSDs, competition between them should be promoted so as to enable market participants a choice of provider and reduce reliance on any one infrastructure provider. In the absence of identical obligations for market operators and common prudential standards for CSDs, divergent measures likely to be taken at national level will have a direct negative impact on the safety, efficiency and competition in the settlement markets in the Union. It is necessary to remove those significant obstacles in the functioning of the internal market and avoid distortions of competition and to prevent such obstacles and distortions from arising in the future. The creation of an integrated market for securities settlement with no distinction between national and cross-border securities transactions is needed for the proper functioning of the internal market. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation should be Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

The directly applicable rules of a regulation should ensure that all market operators and CSDs are subject to identical directly applicable obligations, standards and rules. A regulation should increase the safety and efficiency of settlement in the Union by preventing any diverging national rules as a result of the transposition of a directive. A regulation should reduce the regulatory complexity for market operators and CSDs resulting from different national rules and should allow CSDs to provide their services on a cross-border basis without having to comply with different sets of national requirements such as those concerning the authorisation, supervision, organisation or risks of CSDs. A regulation imposing identical requirements on CSDs should also contribute to eliminating competitive distortions.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">On 20 October 2010, the Financial Stability Board called for more robust core market infrastructures and asked for the revision and enhancement of the existing standards. In April 2012, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) adopted global standards for financial market infrastructures. Those standards have replaced the BIS recommendations of 2001, which were adapted through non-binding guidelines at European level in 2009 by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators. Taking into account the global nature of financial markets and the systemic importance of CSDs, it is necessary to ensure international convergence of the prudential requirements to which they are subject. This Regulation should follow the existing principles for financial market infrastructures developed by CPSS-IOSCO. The Commission and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (‘ESMA’), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc5-L_2014257EN.01000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_2014257EN.01000101-E0005"

                           <p class="oj-normal">One of the basic tasks of the ESCB is to promote the smooth operation of payment systems. In this respect, the members of the ESCB execute oversight by ensuring efficient and sound clearing and payment systems. The members of the ESCB often act as settlement agents for the cash leg of securities transactions. They are also significant clients of CSDs, which often manage the collateralisation of monetary policy operations. The members of the ESCB should be closely involved, by being consulted, in the authorisation and supervision of CSDs, the recognition of third-country CSDs and the approval of certain CSD links. To prevent the emergence of parallel sets of rules, they should also be closely involved by being consulted in the setting of regulatory and implementing technical standards as well as of guidelines and recommendations although primary responsibility for the setting of such technical standards, guidelines and recommendations should rest with the Commission and ESMA, as laid down in this Regulation. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the responsibilities of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Union and other countries. This Regulation should not prevent the members of the ESCB from accessing the information relevant for the performance of their duties, including the oversight of CSDs and other financial market infrastructures.</p>

For reasons of safety, this Regulation provides for the recording in book-entry form of all transferable securities admitted to trading or traded on the trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_2014257EN.01000101-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2014257EN.01000101-E0007"

This Regulation should not impose the type of institution that is to record securities in book-entry form upon issuance but, rather, should permit different actors, including registrars, to perform that function. However, once transactions in such securities are executed on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 or provided as collateral under the conditions laid down in Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc9-L_2014257EN.01000101-E0009" href="#ntr9-L_2014257EN.01000101-E0009"

Different durations of settlement periods across Member States hamper reconciliation and are sources of errors for issuers, investors and intermediaries. It is therefore necessary to provide a common settlement period which would facilitate the identification of the intended settlement date and facilitate the implementation of settlement discipline measures. The intended settlement date of transactions in transferable securities which are executed on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. For complex operations composed of several transactions such as securities repurchase or lending agreements, that requirement should apply to the first transaction involving a transfer of securities. Given their non-standardised character, that requirement should not apply to transactions that are negotiated privately by the relevant parties, but executed on the trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 or to transactions that are executed bilaterally, but reported to a trading venue regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. Moreover, that requirement should not apply to the first transaction where the transferable securities concerned are subject to initial recording in book-entry form.</p>

This Regulation should provide for uniform rules concerning penalties and certain aspects of the buy-in transaction for all transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, such as timing and pricing. Those rules should be adapted to the specificities of different securities markets, certain trading venues such as SME growth markets as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU and certain complex operations such as very short-term securities repurchase or lending agreements, in order to avoid adversely impacting on the liquidity and efficiency of securities markets. The rules on settlement discipline should be applied in a manner that provides an incentive for the settlement of transactions in all relevant financial instruments by their intended settlement date.</p>

In particular, market-making activities play a crucial role in providing liquidity to markets within the Union, particularly to less liquid securities. Measures to prevent and address settlement fails should be balanced against the need to maintain and protect liquidity in those securities. Cash penalties imposed on failing participants should, where possible, be credited to the non-failing clients as compensation and should not, in any event, become a source of revenue for the CSD concerned. CSDs should consult the market infrastructures in respect of which they provide CSD services on the implementation of settlement discipline measures laid down in this Regulation.</p>

However, for illiquid financial instruments it is appropriate that the period before initiating the buy-in process should be increased to a maximum of seven business days. The basis for determining when financial instruments are deemed to be illiquid should be established through regulatory technical standards, taking account of the assessments already made in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. Where such a determination is made the extension of the deadline for initiating the buy-in process should be up to seven business days.</p>

As identified in the Commission Staff Working Paper of 7 December 2011 accompanying the Commission communication entitled, ‘An action plan to improve access to finance for SMEs’, access to capital markets should be developed as an alternative to bank lending to SMEs and it is therefore appropriate to tailor the rules to better serve the needs of those SME growth markets.</p>

Member States should specifically designate the competent authorities responsible for the application of this Regulation, which should be afforded the supervisory and investigatory powers necessary for the exercise of their functions. A CSD should be subject to authorisation and supervision by the competent authority of its home Member State, which is well placed and should be empowered to examine how CSDs operate on a daily basis, to carry out regular reviews and to take appropriate action when necessary. The competent authority concerned should however consult at the earliest stage and cooperate with other relevant authorities, which include the authorities responsible for the oversight of each securities settlement system operated by the CSD, the central banks that issue the most relevant settlement currencies, where applicable, the relevant central banks that act as settlement agent for each securities settlement system, and, also, where applicable, the competent authorities of other group entities. Such cooperation also implies exchanges of information between the authorities concerned and the immediate notification of those authorities in the case of an emergency situation affecting the liquidity and stability of the financial system in any of the Member States where the CSD or any of its participants is established.</p>

Such cooperation arrangements, however, should not be considered to be colleges of supervisors as referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. No Member State or group of Member States should be discriminated against directly or indirectly, as a location for CSD and settlement services. While performing its duties under this Regulation no authority should directly or indirectly discriminate against any undertaking from another Member State.

A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs to provide their services to participants. CSDs should publicly disclose prices and fees for their services. In order to provide open and non-discriminatory access to their services and in view of the significant market power that CSDs still enjoy in the territory of their respective Member States, CSDs should not be able to diverge from their published pricing policy for their core services and should maintain separate accounts for the costs and revenues associated with each of their core services and with their ancillary services. Those participation provisions complement and reinforce the right of market participants to use a settlement system in another Member State provided for in Directive 2014/65/EU.</p>

It is particularly important that any potential risks resulting from the link arrangements such as credit, liquidity, organisational or any other relevant risks for CSDs are fully mitigated. For interoperable links, it is important that linked securities settlement systems have identical moments of entry of transfer orders into the system and irrevocability of such transfer orders and use equivalent rules concerning the moment of finality of transfers of securities and cash.

In order to remove this barrier to the smooth functioning of the Union post-trading market and to allow issuers to opt for the most efficient way of managing their securities, issuers should have the right to choose any CSD established in the Union for recording their securities and receiving any relevant CSD services. Since harmonisation of national corporate law is beyond the scope of this Regulation, such national corporate or similar law under which the securities are constituted should continue to apply and arrangements be made to ensure that the requirements of such national corporate or similar law can be met where the right of choice of CSD is exercised. Such national corporate and similar law under which the securities are constituted govern the relationship between their issuer and holders or any third parties, and their respective rights and duties attached to the securities such as voting rights, dividends and corporate actions. A refusal to provide services to an issuer should be permissible only based on a comprehensive risk assessment or if that CSD does not provide any issuance services in relation to securities constituted under the corporate or similar law of the relevant Member State. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs to provide their services to issuers.</p>

It is necessary to lay down uniform conditions for links between CSDs and of access between CSDs and other market infrastructures. In order to enable CSDs to offer their participants access to other markets, they should have a right to become a participant in another CSD or request another CSD to develop special functions for having access to the latter. Such access should be granted on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and should be refused only where it threatens the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or causes systemic risk. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of a CSD to grant access to another CSD.
