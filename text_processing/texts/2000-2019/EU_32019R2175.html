                           <p class="oj-normal">Following the financial crisis and the recommendations of a group of high-level experts led by Jacques de Larosière, the Union has made important progress in creating not only stronger, but also more harmonised rules for the financial markets in the form of the Single Rulebook. The Union has also set up the European system of financial supervision (ESFS), built on a two-pillar system which combines micro-prudential supervision, coordinated by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), and macro-prudential supervision through the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The three ESAs, namely the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2019334EN.01000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2019334EN.01000101-E0004"

Ten years after the onset of the financial crisis and the establishment of the new supervisory system, financial services and the capital markets union will be increasingly driven by two major developments: sustainable finance and technological innovation. Both have the potential to transform financial services and our system of financial supervision should be equipped for them. It is therefore crucial that the financial system plays its full part in meeting critical sustainability challenges. This will require active contribution by the ESAs to create the appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework.</p>

Therefore, it is necessary to entrust EBA, in addition to its current competences, with the power to act within the scope of Regulations (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010 insofar as such power relates to the prevention and countering of money laundering or of terrorist financing where it concerns financial sector operators and the competent authorities supervising them, which are covered by those Regulations.

A potential breach is where the competent authority has reasonable grounds to suspect that a breach has occurred, but at that stage is not in a position to finally conclude that it has occurred. However, due to the information obtained at that stage such as information from on-site inspections or off-site proceedings, it is very likely that a breach has occurred. Inappropriate or ineffective application of legal provisions is constituted by the failure of a financial sector operator to implement the requirements of those acts in a satisfactory manner. Inappropriate or ineffective application of a financial sector operator’s internal policies and procedures aiming at ensuring compliance with those acts should be considered as constituting a weakness substantially raising the risk that breaches have occurred or can occur.</p>

To that end, the activities of the competent authorities are subject to peer reviews. The ESAs should also ensure that the methodology is applied in the same manner. Such peer reviews should not only focus on the convergence of supervisory practices, but also on the capacity of competent authorities to achieve high-quality supervisory outcomes, as well as on the independence of those competent authorities. The main findings of those peer reviews should be published to encourage compliance and increase transparency, unless such publication would involve risks to financial stability.</p>

In particular, the assessment should – to the extent possible – reflect experience gained from situations where EBA requests a competent authority to: investigate possible breaches of national laws to the extent that they transpose Directives or exercise options to Member States by Union law by financial sector operators; consider imposing sanctions on that operator in respect of such breaches; or consider adopting an individual decision addressed to that financial sector operator requiring it to undertake all necessary action to comply with its obligations under national laws to the extent that they transpose Directives or exercise options granted to Member States by Union law. It should similarly reflect such experience where EBA applies national law to the extent it transposes Directives or exercises options granted to Member States by Union law. The Commission should submit that assessment as part of its report pursuant to Article 65 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, together with legislative proposals, if appropriate, to the European Parliament and to the Council by 11 January 2022. Until that assessment has been submitted, the powers granted to EBA related to preventing the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist financing in Articles 9b, 17(6) and 19(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 should be considered a provisional solution to the extent that they allow EBA to base requests to competent authorities on possible breaches of national law or allow the application of national law by EBA.</p>

Those requirements include enhanced risk disclosure to clients, better assessment of suitability of products recommended as well as an obligation to distribute financial instruments to the identified target market, taking into account factors such as the solvency of issuers.

Those benchmarks are therefore of crucial importance for the functioning of financial markets and financial stability in the Union. The supervision of a critical benchmark should therefore take a holistic view of potential impacts, not only in the Member State where the administrator is located and the Member States where its contributors are located, but across the entire Union. It is therefore appropriate that certain critical benchmarks are supervised at Union level by ESMA. To avoid duplication of tasks, administrators of critical benchmarks should be supervised only by ESMA, including any non-critical benchmarks they might administer.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The procedure to determine the Member State of reference for benchmark administrators located in third countries that apply for recognition in the Union is cumbersome and time-consuming for both applicants and national competent authorities. Applicants might try to influence that determination in the hope of having supervisory arbitrage. Those benchmark administrators might choose their legal representative strategically in a Member State where they consider supervision less strict. A harmonised approach with ESMA as the competent authority for recognising third-country benchmark administrators avoids those risks and the costs of determining the Member State of reference as well as of the subsequent supervision. Furthermore, ESMA’s role as competent authority for recognised third-country benchmark administrators establishes it as the counterpart in the Union for supervisors in third countries, making cross-border cooperation more efficient and effective.</p>
