This target for emissions reduction will help to fulfil the Paris Agreement long-term goals and all sectors of the economy should contribute to achieving it. The transport sector needs a comprehensive approach for the promotion of emission reductions and energy efficiency. Progress should be made towards low-emission mobility, inter alia, through research and through the introduction of technological advances that are already available. Drivers need to be properly trained to drive in the most efficient manner.</p>

                                    <p class="oj-normal">Compulsory periodic training courses must be organised by an approved training centre. Their duration must be of 35 hours every five years, given in periods of at least seven hours, which may be split over two consecutive days. Whenever e-learning is used, the approved training centre shall ensure that the proper quality of the training is maintained, including by selecting the subjects where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. In particular, Member States shall require reliable user identification and appropriate means of control. The maximum duration of the e-learning training shall not exceed 12 hours. At least one of the training course periods shall cover a road safety related subject. The content of the training shall take into account training needs specific to the transport operations carried out by the driver and relevant legal and technological developments and should, as far as possible, take into account specific training needs of the driver. A range of different subjects should be covered over the 35 hours, including repeat training where it is shown that the driver needs specific remedial training.</p>

However, Member States may decide that completed specific training as required under Directive 2008/68/EC for the transport of dangerous goods counts as two of the seven-hour periods, provided that this is the only other training that is taken into account in the periodic training.’.</p>
