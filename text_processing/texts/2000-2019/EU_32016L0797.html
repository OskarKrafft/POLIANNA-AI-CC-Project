                           <p class="oj-normal">In view of the extent and complexity of the Union rail system, it has proved necessary, for practical reasons, to break it down into the following subsystems: infrastructure, trackside control-command and signalling, on-board control-command and signalling, energy, rolling stock, operation and traffic management, maintenance and telematics applications for passenger and freight services. For each of those subsystems, the essential requirements need to be specified and the technical specifications determined, particularly in respect of constituents and interfaces, in order to meet those essential requirements. The same system is broken down into fixed and mobile elements comprising, on the one hand, the network, which is composed of the lines, stations, terminals, and all kinds of fixed equipment needed to ensure safe and continuous operation of the system and, on the other hand, all vehicles travelling on that network. Therefore, for the purposes of this Directive, a vehicle is composed of one subsystem (rolling stock) and where applicable other subsystems (mainly the on-board control-command and signalling subsystem). Although the system is divided into several elements, the Agency should retain an overview of the system, in order to promote interoperability and safety.</p>

In the present case, explanatory documents could have been useful to this end. The Commission regrets that the final text does not contain provisions to this effect.</p>
