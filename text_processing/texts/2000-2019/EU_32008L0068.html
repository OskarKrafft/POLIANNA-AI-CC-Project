Following use, these nominally empty cylinders and pressure drums are required to be returned to the country of origin, for refilling with the specially specified gases – they are not to be refilled within Ireland or indeed within any part of the ADR area. Though not in compliance with the ADR, they are in compliance with and accepted for the purposes of the IMDG Code. The multimodal transport, beginning from outside the ADR area, is intended to finish at the importer’s premises, from where it is intended that these cylinders and pressure drums be distributed to the final user locally within Ireland in small quantities. This carriage, within Ireland, would fall within the amended Article 6(9) of Directive 94/55/EC.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Initial reference to the national legislation: Carriage of Explosives by Road Regulations 1996, reg. 13, Schedule 3.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Comments: UK Regulations allow a maximum net mass of 5 000 kg in Type II vehicles for Compatibility Groups 1.1C, 1.1D, 1.1E and 1.1J.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Many articles of Class 1.1C, 1.1D, 1.1E and 1.1J being moved in Europe are large or bulky and exceed about 2,5 m in length. They are primarily explosive articles for military use. The limitations on the construction for EX/III vehicles (which are required to be closed vehicles) make it very difficult to load and unload such articles. Some articles would require specialist loading and unloading equipment at both ends of the journey. In practice, this equipment rarely exists. There are few EX/III vehicles in use in the UK and it would be extremely onerous on industry to require further specialist EX/III vehicles to be constructed to carry this type of explosive.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In the UK military explosives are mostly carried by commercial carriers and are thus unable to take advantage of the exemption for military vehicles in the Framework Directive. To overcome this problem, the UK has always permitted the carriage of up to 5 000 kg of such articles on EX/II vehicles. The present limit is not always sufficient because an article may contain more than 1 000 kg of explosive.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Since 1950 there have been only two incidents (both in the 1950s) involving blasting explosives with a weight above 5 000 kg. The incidents were caused by a tyre fire and a hot exhaust system setting fire to the sheeting. The fires could have occurred with a smaller load. There were no fatalities or injuries.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">There is empirical evidence to suggest that correctly packaged explosive articles would be unlikely to ignite due to impact, e.g. from vehicle collisions. Evidence from military reports and from trials data on missile impact tests shows that it needs an impact velocity in excess of that created by the 12 metre drop test to bring about the ignition of cartridges.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Present safety standards would not be affected.</p>

Experience has shown that for these vehicles the fixing of orange placards is problematic and they are difficult to retain under normal conditions of transport. The vehicles will be marked with placards identifying the contents in accordance with 5.3.1.5.2 of the ADR (and normally 5.3.1.7.4) clearly identifying the hazard. In addition, a fireproof notice carrying relevant emergency information will be attached in a clearly visible location. In practice, more safety information will be available than under the requirements of 5.3.2 of the ADR.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Comments: The scheme has been designed in such a way as to enable private citizens to present ‘small chemical waste’ at a single location. This applies to residual substances such as dye waste, for instance. The danger level is minimised by the choice of means of transport, involving, inter alia, the use of special transport elements and ‘no smoking’ notices clearly visible to members of the public.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In view of the limited quantities offered and the specialised nature of the packaging, this article excludes a number of sections of the ADR. Supplementary rules are laid down elsewhere in the scheme.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Comments: Because of the wide range of domestic hazardous waste involved, the transport operator must have a certificate of professional competence, notwithstanding the small quantities of waste presented. An additional requirement is for the transport operator to have been issued with a qualification for the transport of hazardous waste.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">One of the reasons for this is to ensure that the transport operator does not, for instance, pack acids and bases together and knows how to respond properly to incidents.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Comments: These derogations may be applied only by authorities seizing dangerous goods.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">This derogation is intended for local transport e.g. of goods that have been seized by the police, such as explosives or stolen property. The problem with these types of goods is that one can never be sure of classifications. In addition, the goods are often not packed, marked or labelled in accordance with the ADR. There are several hundred such transportations carried out by the police every year. In the case of smuggled liquor, this must be transported from the place where it is seized to a facility where evidence is stored and then on to a facility for destruction; the latter two may be quite far apart from each other. The deviations permitted are: (a) each package does not need to be labelled; and (b) approved packages do not need to be used. However, each pallet containing such packages must be correctly labelled. All other requirements must be fulfilled. There are approximately 20 such transportations each year.</p>
