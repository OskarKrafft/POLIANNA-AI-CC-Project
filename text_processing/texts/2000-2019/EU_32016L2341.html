A genuine internal market for occupational retirement provision remains crucial for economic growth and job creation in the Union and for tackling the challenge of an ageing society. That Directive, dating from 2003, has not been substantially amended to introduce a modern risk-based governance system for IORPs. Appropriate regulation and supervision at Union and national level remain important for the development of safe and secure occupational retirement provision across all Member States.</p>

This is important since social security systems are coming under increasing pressure, which means that occupational retirement pensions are increasingly relied on to complement other retirement provisions. IORPs play an important role in the long-term financing of the Union's economy and in the provision of secure retirement benefits. They are a vital part of the Union economy, holding assets worth EUR 2,5 trillion on behalf of around 75 million members and beneficiaries. Occupational retirement pensions should be improved, without, however, calling into question the major importance of social security pension systems in terms of secure, durable and effective social protection, which should guarantee a decent standard of living in old age and should therefore be at the centre of the objective of strengthening the European social models.</p>

This is all the more important as longevity and market risks are increasingly borne by members and beneficiaries rather than the IORP or the sponsoring undertaking.

Appropriate cover for biometric risks in occupational pension arrangements is an important aspect of the fight against poverty and insecurity among elderly people. When setting up a pension scheme, employers and employees, or their respective representatives, should consider the possibility of the pension scheme including provisions for the coverage of the longevity risk and occupational disability risks as well as provision for surviving dependants.</p>

Redemption of the assets held by IORPs cannot, in general, be made for any purpose other than providing retirement benefits. Furthermore, in order to protect adequately the rights of members and beneficiaries, IORPs should be able to opt for an asset allocation that suits the precise nature and duration of their liabilities. Therefore, efficient supervision is required as well as an approach to investment rules that allows IORPs sufficient flexibility to decide on the most secure and efficient investment policy and obliges them to act prudently. Compliance with the prudent person rule therefore requires an investment policy geared to the membership structure of the individual IORP.</p>

Non-listed undertakings include infrastructure projects, unlisted companies seeking growth, real estate or other assets that could be suitable for long term investment purposes. Low carbon and climate resilient infrastructure projects are often non-listed assets and rely on long term credits for project financing.</p>

IORPs should, as part of their risk management system, produce a risk assessment for their activities relating to pensions. That risk assessment should also be made available to the competent authorities and should, where relevant, include, inter alia, risks related to climate change, use of resources, the environment, social risks, and risks related to the depreciation of assets due to regulatory change (‘stranded assets’).</p>

In particular, information concerning accrued pension entitlements, projected levels of retirement benefits, risks and guarantees, and costs should be given. Where projected levels of retirement benefits are based on economic scenarios, that information should also include an unfavourable scenario, which should be extreme but plausible. Where members bear an investment risk, additional information on the investment profile, any available options and past performance are also crucial. Information should be adequate to the needs of the user and should take into account the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular as regards accessibility and access to information, as provided for in Articles 3 and 21 thereof respectively. Member States can choose to further specify by whom the information to be given to prospective members, members and beneficiaries can be provided including through pension tracking services.</p>
