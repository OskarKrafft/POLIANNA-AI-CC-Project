The purpose of such a partnership is to ensure respect for the principles of multi-level governance, and also of subsidiarity and proportionality and the specificities of the Member States' different institutional and legal frameworks as well as to ensure the ownership of planned interventions by stakeholders and build on the experience and the know-how of relevant actors. The Member States should identify the most representative relevant partners. Those partners should include institutions, organisations and groups which are capable of influencing the preparation or could be affected by the preparation and implementation of the programmes. In this context it should also be possible for Member States to identify, where appropriate, as relevant partners, umbrella organisations which are the associations, federations or confederations of relevant regional, local and urban authorities or other bodies in accordance with applicable national law and practices.</p>

That adopted delegated act should have under no circumstances and in no way of its interpretation retroactive effect or be the basis for establishing irregularities leading to financial corrections. The adopted delegated act should not specify a date of application that is earlier than the date of its adoption. The adopted delegated act should allow Member States to decide on the most appropriate detailed arrangements for implementing the partnership in accordance with their institutional and legal framework as well as their national and regional competences, provided that its objectives, as laid down in this Regulation, are achieved.</p>

The Partnership Agreement should set out arrangements to ensure alignment with the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as well as with the Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, arrangements to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the ESI Funds and arrangements for the partnership principle and an integrated approach to territorial development.

It is necessary to envisage specific arrangements for the submission and adoption of the Partnership Agreement and the programmes should the entry into force of one or more Fund-specific Regulations be delayed or be expected to be delayed. This entails establishing provisions which allow for the submission and adoption of the Partnership Agreement even in the absence of certain elements in relation to the ESI Fund or Funds affected by the delay, and the later submission of a revised Partnership Agreement after the entry into force of the delayed Fund-specific Regulation or Regulations. Since the programmes co-financed by the ESI Fund affected by the delay should in this case be submitted and adopted only after the entry into force of the Fund-specific Regulation concerned, appropriate deadlines for the submission of the affected programmes should also be laid down.</p>

Under the first strand of measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance, the Commission should be able to request amendments to the Partnership Agreement and to the programmes in order to support the implementation of relevant Council recommendations or to maximise the growth and competitiveness impact of the available ESI Funds where Member States are receiving relevant financial assistance. Reprogramming should be used only in cases where it could indeed have a direct impact on the correction of the challenges identified in the relevant Council recommendations under the economic governance mechanisms in order to avoid frequent reprogramming which would disrupt fund management predictability. Under the second strand of measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance, where a Member State fails to take effective action in the context of the economic governance process, the Commission should make a proposal to the Council to suspend part or all of the commitments or payments for the programmes of that Member State. It is necessary to establish different procedures for the suspension of commitments and payments. Nevertheless, in both cases, when making a proposal for a suspension, the Commission should take into account all relevant information and give due consideration to any elements arising from, and opinions expressed through, the structured dialogue with the European Parliament.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">The scope and level of a suspension should be proportionate and effective, and respect equality of treatment between Member States. Furthermore, a suspension should take into account the economic and social circumstances of the Member State concerned as well as the possible overall economic impact on a Member State resulting from the different steps of the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) and excessive imbalances procedure (EIP).</p>

To be sufficiently attractive to the private sector, it is essential that financial instruments are designed and implemented in a flexible manner. Managing authorities should therefore decide on the most appropriate forms for implementing financial instruments in order to address the specific needs of the target regions, in accordance with the objectives of the relevant programme, the results of the ex ante assessment and applicable State aid rules. Where applicable, such flexibility should also include the possibility to reuse part of the resources paid back during the eligibility period in order to provide for the preferential remuneration of private investors or public investors operating under the market economy principle. Such preferential remuneration should take into account market standards and ensure that any State aid complies with applicable Union and national law and is limited to the minimum amount necessary to compensate for the lack of private capital available, taking into account market failures or suboptimal investment situations.</p>

On the basis of such reports, the Commission should prepare a strategic report on progress in 2017 and 2019. In order to provide for a regular strategic policy debate on the contribution of the ESI Funds to the achievement of the Union strategy on smart sustainable and inclusive growth, and to improve the quality of spending and the effectiveness of the policy in line with the European Semester, the strategic reports should be debated in the Council. On the basis of that debate the Council should be able to provide input to the assessment made at the spring meeting of the European Council on the role of all Union policies and instruments in delivering sustainable job-creating growth across the Union.</p>

The flat rates should be based on historical data available to the Commission, the potential for cost recovery and the polluter-pays principle, where applicable. There should also be provision to extend flat rates to new sectors, introduce subsectors or review the rates for future operations when new data becomes available, by means of a delegated act. The use of flat rates could be particularly suitable for operations in the fields of information and communication technologies (ICT), RDI and energy efficiency. In addition, to ensure the application of the principle of proportionality and to take account of other regulatory and contractual provisions that could apply, it is necessary to set out the exemptions from those rules.</p>

Experience has shown that a period of five years is an appropriate minimum period to be applied, except where State aid rules provide for a different period. Nevertheless, and in line with the principle of proportionality, it is possible that a more limited period of three years would be justified where the investment concerns the maintenance of investments or jobs created by SMEs. In the case of an operation comprising investment in infrastructure or productive investment, and where the beneficiary is not an SME, such an operation should repay the contribution from the ESI Funds if, within 10 years of the final payment to the beneficiary, the productive activity is subject to relocation outside the Union. It is appropriate to exclude actions supported by the ESF and those not entailing productive investment or investment in infrastructure from the general requirement of durability, unless such requirements are derived from applicable State aid rules, and to exclude contributions to or from financial instruments. Sums unduly paid should be recovered and be subject to procedures applicable to irregularities.</p>

Therefore it is justified that operations above certain thresholds continue to be subject to specific approval procedures under this Regulation.

Nevertheless, it should be possible to carry out audits at any time where there is evidence of an irregularity or fraud, or, following closure of a completed operation, as part of an audit sample. The Commission should be able to review the audit trail of the audit authority or take part in on-the-spot audits of the audit authority. Where the Commission does not obtain the necessary assurance as to the effective functioning of the audit authority by those means, the Commission should be able to carry out a re-performance of the audit activity where this is in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. In order that the level of auditing by the Commission is proportionate to the risk, the Commission should be able to reduce its audit work in relation to operational programmes where there are no significant deficiencies or where the audit authority can be relied on. In order to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries, specific rules should be introduced to reduce the risk of overlap between audits of the same operations by various institutions, namely the European Court of Auditors, the Commission and the audit authority.</p>

Member States shall provide information on the support for climate change objectives using a methodology based on the categories of intervention, focus areas or measures, as appropriate, for each of the ESI Funds. That methodology shall consist of assigning a specific weighting to the support provided under the ESI Funds at a level which reflects the extent to which such support makes a contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. The specific weighting assigned shall be differentiated on the basis of whether the support makes a significant or a moderate contribution towards climate change objectives. Where the support does not contribute towards those objectives or the contribution is insignificant, a weighting of zero shall be assigned. In the case of the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund weightings shall be attached to categories of intervention established within the nomenclature adopted by the Commission. In the case of the EAFRD weightings shall be attached to focus areas set out in the EAFRD Regulation and in the case of the EMFF to measures set out in the EMFF Regulation.</p>
                     <p class="oj-normal">The Commission shall set out uniform conditions for each of the ESI Funds for the application of the methodology referred to in the second paragraph by means of an implementing act.

The Common Strategic Framework (CSF) shall therefore, in accordance with Article 10, and in compliance with the priorities and objectives laid down in the Fund-specific Regulations, provide strategic guiding principles in order to achieve an integrated development approach using the ESI Funds coordinated with other Union instruments and policies, in line with the policy objectives and headline targets of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and, where appropriate, the flagship initiatives, while taking into account the key territorial challenges and specific national, regional and local contexts.</p>

The capping will be applied on an annual basis, subject to adjustments necessary to accommodate the frontloading of the YEI, and will - if applicable - proportionally reduce all transfers (except for the more developed regions and European territorial cooperation goal) to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum level of transfer. For Member States which acceded to the Union before 2013 and whose average real GDP growth 2008-2010 was lower than -1 %, the maximum level of transfer will be 2,59 %.</span>
