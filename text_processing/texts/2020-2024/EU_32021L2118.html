It is also a major concern for insurance undertakings, as it constitutes an important segment of the ‘non-life’ insurance market in the Union. Motor insurance also has a significant impact on the free movement of persons, goods and vehicles, and hence on the internal market. Reinforcing and consolidating the internal market for motor insurance should therefore be a key objective of Union action in the field of financial services.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In 2017, the Commission carried out an evaluation of the functioning of Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc3-L_2021430EN.01000101-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_2021430EN.01000101-E0003"

The conclusion of the evaluation was that Directive 2009/103/EC functions well on the whole, and does not need amendment in most aspects. However, four areas were identified in respect of which targeted amendments would be appropriate: compensation of parties injured as a result of accidents where the insurance undertaking concerned is insolvent, minimum obligatory amounts of insurance cover, insurance checks of vehicles by Member States, and the use of policyholders’ claims-history statements by a new insurance undertaking. In addition to those four areas, the following, namely dispatched vehicles, accidents involving a trailer towed by a vehicle, motor insurance independent price comparison tools, and information centres and information to injured parties, have also been identified as areas in respect of which targeted amendments would be appropriate. Furthermore, the clarity of Directive 2009/103/EC should be enhanced by replacing the term ‘victim’, which is used in that Directive as a synonym of ‘injured party’, by the term ‘injured party’ or ‘party injured’, as appropriate, through appropriate amendments. Those amendments have the exclusive objective of harmonising the terminology used in that Directive and do not constitute a change of substance.</p>

Some of them are powered by a purely electrical motor, some of them by auxiliary equipment. Such vehicles should be taken into account in defining the meaning of ‘vehicle’. That definition should be based on the general characteristics of such vehicles, in particular their maximum design speeds and net weights, and should provide that only vehicles propelled exclusively by mechanical power are covered. The definition should apply independently of the number of wheels that the vehicle has. Wheelchairs intended for use by persons with physical disabilities should not be included in the definition.</p>

However, nothing in that Directive should hinder Member States from requiring, under their national law, motor insurance, subject to conditions to be set by them, in respect of any motor equipment used on land that does not fall within that Directive’s definition of ‘vehicle’, and for which consequently that Directive does not require such insurance. Nor should that Directive hinder Member States from providing, in their national laws, for the victims of accidents caused by any other motor equipment to have access to the Member State’s compensation body as determined in Chapter 4. Member States should also be able to decide that, where residents of their territory are parties injured in an accident caused by such other motor equipment in another Member State in which motor insurance is not required for that motor equipment, those residents are to have access to the compensation body as determined in Chapter 4 in the Member State where they are residing. Compensation bodies of Member States should have the possibility of entering into a mutual agreement about the ways in which they will cooperate in that kind of situation.</p>

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">6</span>)</a>, the Court of Justice clarified the meaning of the concept ‘use of vehicles’. In particular, the Court of Justice clarified that motor vehicles are intended normally to serve as a means of transport, irrespective of such vehicles’ characteristics, and that the use of such vehicles covers any use of a vehicle consistent with its normal function as a means of transport, irrespective of the terrain on which the motor vehicle is used and of whether it is stationary or in motion. Directive 2009/103/EC does not apply if, at the time of the accident, the normal function of such a vehicle is ‘use other than as a means of transport’. This could be the case if the vehicle is not being used within the meaning of Article 3, first paragraph, of that Directive, as its normal function is, for instance, ‘use as an industrial or agricultural power source’. In the interest of legal certainty, it is appropriate to reflect that case-law in Directive 2009/103/EC by introducing a definition of ‘use of a vehicle’.</p>

It would be disproportionate and not future proof to include them in the scope of Directive 2009/103/EC. Including them would also undermine the uptake of newer vehicles, such as electric bicycles that are not exclusively propelled by mechanical power, and discourage innovation. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence that such smaller vehicles could cause accidents resulting in injured parties at the same scale as other vehicles, such as cars or trucks. In line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, requirements at Union level should, therefore, cover only those vehicles that are defined as such in Directive 2009/103/EC.</p>

However, in order not to reduce the protection granted by Directive 2009/103/EC, such legal practices should be allowed only if a Member State ensures that in such cases the injured parties are compensated for such damage in a manner that is as close as possible to how they would be compensated under Directive 2009/103/EC. Unless the Member State has provided for such an alternative compensation mechanism or guarantee, ensuring compensation of injured parties for such damage in a manner that is as close as possible to how they would be compensated under Directive 2009/103/EC, such damage should be covered in accordance with that Directive.</p>

In order to simplify the verification and authentication of claims-history statements, it is important for their content and format to be the same across all Member States. In addition, insurance undertakings that take into account claims-history statements to determine motor insurance premiums should not discriminate on the basis of nationality or solely on the basis of the previous Member State of residence of the policyholder. Moreover, insurance undertakings should treat a claims-history statement from another Member State as equal to a domestic claims-history statement and apply to a client from another Member State any discounts that would be available to an otherwise identical domestic client, including those discounts that are required by the Member State’s national legislation, such as ‘bonus-malus’ discounts. Member States should remain free to adopt national legislation concerning ‘bonus-malus’ systems, since such systems are national in nature and without any cross-border element, and therefore, under the principle of subsidiarity, decision-making concerning them should remain with the Member States. To enable Member States to verify whether and how insurance undertakings treat claims-history statements, insurance undertakings should publish a general overview of their policies in respect of their use of claims history when calculating premiums.

            <p class="oj-normal">The Commission remains committed to defend a high degree of protection of victims in the context of the Motor Insurance Directive. Our objective is to ensure that victims, including in cross-border situations, are compensated as swiftly as possible and are not subject to disproportionate procedural requirements that might hamper their access to compensation. The effectiveness of compensation largely depends on whether it is done in timely manner. We note in this respect the concerns repeatedly expressed by the European Parliament as regards differences across Member States in relation to limitation periods, i.e. the relevant timespan during which an injured party may address a claim. The Commission will consider this issue carefully and examine possible remedies in order to further strengthen the protection of victims, should the evidence show that action at Union level is warranted.</p>
