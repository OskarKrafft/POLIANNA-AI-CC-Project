In its communication of 17 September 2020 entitled ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition – Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people’, the Commission proposed to increase the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to at least 55 % by 2030. That ambition was endorsed by the European Council on 11 December 2020 and the impact assessment accompanying that communication confirms that the energy mix of the future will be very different from the one of today and underpins the necessity to review and if necessary to revise the energy legislation. The current energy infrastructure investments are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure of the future. That also means infrastructure needs to be in place to support the European energy transition, including rapid electrification, scaling up of renewable and fossil fuel free electricity generation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy system integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions.</p>

Projects of common interest in electricity and gas have strongly contributed to security of supply. For gas, the infrastructure is now better connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. Regional cooperation in regional groups and through cross-border cost allocation is an important enabler for project implementation. However, in many cases the cross-border cost allocation did not result in reducing the financing gap of the projects, as intended. While the majority of permitting procedures have been shortened, in some cases the process is still long. The financial assistance from the Connecting Europe Facility, established by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_2022152EN.01004501-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2022152EN.01004501-E0007"

To achieve higher levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest, Europe will need a more integrated energy system, relying on higher levels of electrification based on additional renewable and low-carbon sources and the decarbonisation of the gas sector. The trans-European energy networks policy can ensure that the Union energy infrastructure development supports the required energy transition to climate neutrality in line with the energy efficiency first principle and technological neutrality while considering the potential for emission reduction in the end use. It can also ensure interconnections, energy security, market and system integration, and competition that benefits all Member States, as well as energy at an affordable price for households and undertakings.</p>

Therefore, among other aspects, both climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives need to be adequately reflected in the revised trans-European energy networks framework. Besides the new political context and objectives, technological development has been rapid in the past decade. That development should be taken into account in the energy infrastructure categories covered by this Regulation, the selection criteria for projects of common interest as well as the priority corridors and areas. At the same time, the provisions of this Regulation should not affect a Member State’s right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply, in accordance with Article 194 TFEU.</p>

Moreover, the Commission’s impact assessment accompanying the Commission communication of 17 September 2020 entitled ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition –Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people’ expects the consumption of natural gas to be reduced significantly because its non-abated use is not compatible with carbon neutrality. On the other hand, the consumption of biogas, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic gaseous fuels is expected to increase significantly towards 2050. For gas, the infrastructure is now better connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. The planning of energy infrastructure should reflect this changing gas landscape. However, not all Member States are yet connected sufficiently to the European gas network and island Member States in particular continue to face significant challenges in terms of security of supply and energy isolation. Although 78 % of gas projects that are projects of common interest are expected to be commissioned by the end of 2025, a number of them are experiencing significant delays, including due to permitting problems. This Regulation should therefore not negatively affect projects of common interest that have not yet been completed on the date of its entry into force. Therefore, projects of common interest included in the fifth Union list of projects of common interest established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, for which an application file has been accepted for examination by the competent authority should be able to maintain their rights and obligations as regards permitting for a period of four years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.</p>

The criteria for that category should be simplified, should include technological developments regarding innovation and digital aspects and should enable energy system integration. Furthermore, the role of projects promoters should be clarified. Given the expected significant increase in power demand from the transport sector, in particular for electric vehicles along highways and in urban areas, smart grid technologies should also help to improve energy network related support for cross-border, high-capacity recharging to support the decarbonisation of the transport sector.</p>

Such system integration starts from the point of departure of applying the energy efficiency first principle and taking a holistic approach in policy and beyond individual sectors. It also addresses the decarbonisation needs of the hard to abate sectors, such as parts of industry or certain modes of transport, where direct electrification is, currently, technically or economically challenging. Such investments include hydrogen and electrolysers, which are progressing towards commercial large-scale deployment. The Commission communication of 8 July 2020 entitled ‘A hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe’ (the ‘Hydrogen Strategy’) gives priority to hydrogen production from renewable electricity, which is the cleanest solution and is most compatible with the Union’s climate neutrality objective. In a transitional phase however, other forms of low-carbon hydrogen are needed to more rapidly decarbonise existing hydrogen production, focusing on a diverse range of clean technologies, and to kick-start an economy of scale.</p>

There is currently very limited dedicated infrastructure in place to transport and trade hydrogen across borders or to create hydrogen valleys. Such infrastructure should consist of a significant extent of assets converted from natural gas assets, complemented by new assets dedicated to hydrogen. Furthermore, the Hydrogen Strategy set a strategic goal to increase installed electrolyser capacity to 40 Gigawatts (GW) by 2030 in order to scale up the production of renewable hydrogen and facilitate the decarbonisation of fossil-fuel dependent sectors, such as industry or transport. Therefore, the trans-European energy networks policy should include new and repurposed hydrogen transmission infrastructure and storage as well as electrolyser facilities. Hydrogen transmission and storage infrastructure should also be included in the Union-wide ten-year network development plan so as to allow a comprehensive and consistent assessment of their costs and benefits for the energy system, including their contribution to sector integration and decarbonisation, with the aim of creating a hydrogen backbone for the Union.</p>

That requirement, in line with the specific needs of the internal energy market at the time, enabled development of projects of common interest which addressed only security of supply risks even if they did not demonstrate benefits in terms of sustainability. However, given the evolution of the Union’s infrastructure needs, the decarbonisation goals and the European Council conclusions adopted on 21 July 2020, according to which Union expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives and the ‘do no harm’ principle of the European Green Deal, sustainability in terms of the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as relevant, should be assessed in order to ensure that trans-European energy networks policy is coherent with the Union’s targets for energy and climate and 2050 climate neutrality objectives, taking into account the specificities of each Member State in reaching the climate neutrality objective.

Therefore, this Regulation should include in its scope projects of mutual interest where they are sustainable and able to demonstrate significant net socioeconomic benefits at Union level and at least one third country. Such projects should be eligible for inclusion in the Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest (the ‘Union list’) provided that the policy framework has a high level of convergence and is supported by enforcement mechanisms, and should demonstrate a contribution to the Union’s and the third countries’ overall energy and climate policy objectives in terms of security of supply and decarbonisation.</p>

In addition, the third country with which the Union cooperates in the development of projects of mutual interest should facilitate a similar timeline for accelerated implementation and other policy support measures, as provided for in this Regulation. Therefore, projects of mutual interest should be treated in the same manner as projects of common interest, with all provisions relative to projects of common interest applying also to projects of mutual interest, unless otherwise specified. Significant net socioeconomic benefits at Union level should be understood as improving interoperability and the functioning of the internal market, going beyond one Member State.

The existing energy infrastructure categories for electricity transmission and storage are crucial for the integration of the significant increase in renewable electricity generation in the power grid. In addition, that requires stepping up investment in offshore renewable energy with the aim of reaching at least 300 GW of offshore wind generation installed in line with the Commission’s offshore renewable energy strategy set out in the Commission communication of 19 November 2020 entitled ‘An EU Strategy to harness the potential of offshore renewable energy for a climate neutral future’. That strategy includes radial links connecting new offshore wind capacities, as well as hybrid integrated projects. Coordinating long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore electricity grids should also be addressed. In particular, offshore infrastructure planning should move away from the project-by-project approach towards a coordinated comprehensive approach ensuring the sustainable development of integrated offshore grids in line with the offshore renewable potential of each sea basin, environmental protection and other uses of the sea. There should be an approach based on voluntary cooperation between Member States. Member States should remain responsible for approving the projects of common interest which are related to their territory and the related costs.</p>

However, while the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (the ‘ENTSO for Electricity’), the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (the ‘ENTSO for Gas’) and TSOs have an important role to play in the process, more scrutiny is required, in particular as regards defining the scenarios for the future, identifying long-term infrastructure gaps and bottlenecks and assessing individual projects, to enhance trust in the process. Therefore, due to the need for independent validation, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (the ‘Agency’) and the Commission should have an increased role in the process, including in the process for drawing up the Union-wide ten-year network development plans pursuant to Regulations (EC) No 715/2009 <a id="ntc14-L_2022152EN.01004501-E0014" href="#ntr14-L_2022152EN.01004501-E0014"

                           <p class="oj-normal">In an increasingly integrated internal energy market, clear and transparent rules for cost allocation across borders are necessary in order to accelerate investment in cross-border infrastructure and in projects with a cross-border impact. It is essential to ensure a stable financing framework for the development of projects of common interest while minimising the need for financial support, and at the same time to encourage interested investors, with appropriate incentives and financial mechanisms. In deciding on cross-border cost allocation, national regulatory authorities should allocate efficiently incurred investment costs, as relevant in view of their national approaches and methodologies for similar infrastructure, across borders in their entirety and include them in the national tariffs, and, afterwards, if relevant, determine whether their impact on national tariffs could represent a disproportionate burden for consumers in their respective Member States. The national regulatory authorities should avoid the risks of double support for projects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only in so far as they relate to the projects, and are designed to cover the costs concerned.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The internal energy market legislation requires that tariffs for access to networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. However, several types of projects of common interest are likely to have externalities that might not be fully captured in, and recovered through, the regular tariff system. In applying the internal energy market legislation, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory and financial framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. That framework should apply in particular to cross-border projects, innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for the large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and energy technology and digitalisation projects, which are either likely to incur higher risks than similar projects located within one Member State or which promise higher benefits for the Union. Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.</p>

That objective should be attained by allowing projects under development or planning that have been granted the status of project of common interest under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 to maintain their status until Cyprus and Malta are interconnected to the trans-European gas network. Apart from contributing to the development of the renewable energy market, the flexibility and resilience of the energy system, and the security of supply, those projects will ensure access to future energy markets, including hydrogen, and contribute to achieving the Union’s overall energy and climate policy objectives.</p>
