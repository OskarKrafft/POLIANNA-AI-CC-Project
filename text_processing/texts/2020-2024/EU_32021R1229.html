The most vulnerable regions and people are the most exposed to the harmful effects of climate change and environmental degradation. The transition towards a climate-neutral economy is a source of new economic opportunities, with significant potential for job creation, in particular in territories that currently depend on fossil fuels. It can also contribute to enhanced energy security and resilience. However, the transition may also trigger short term social and economic costs in territories undergoing heavy decarbonisation process, and already weakened by the disruptive economic and social effects of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

The creation of a Just Transition Mechanism has also been affirmed by the conclusions of the European Council of 21 July 2020. The Just Transition Mechanism consists of three pillars: a Just Transition Fund (JTF) implemented under shared management, a dedicated Just Transition Scheme under InvestEU, and a public sector loan facility to mobilise additional investments to the regions concerned. Those three pillars provide complementary support to those regions, with a view to fostering the transition to a climate-neutral economy by 2050.</p>

By supporting investments that do not generate sufficient streams of revenues to cover their investment costs, the Facility should aim to provide public sector entities with the additional resources necessary to address the territorial, social, economic and environmental challenges that will result from the adjustment to the transition. In order to help identify investments that are eligible under the Facility and that have a high positive environmental impact, including in relation to biodiversity, the Commission should take into account, when carrying out the evaluation of the Facility, the EU taxonomy on environmentally sustainable economic activities.
