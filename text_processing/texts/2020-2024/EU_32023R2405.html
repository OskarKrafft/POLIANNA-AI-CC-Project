It has been a strong driver for economic growth, jobs, trade and tourism, as well as for connectivity and mobility for businesses and citizens alike, and one of the main connectors between outermost regions and the mainland, particularly within the Union air transport market. Growth in air transport services has significantly contributed to improving connectivity, fostering cohesion, and reducing regional disparities within the Union, in particular for peripheral, outermost, sparsely populated and insular regions, as well as with third countries, and has been a significant enabler of the Union economy.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">From 2020, air transport has been one of the hardest hit sector by the COVID-19 crisis. It is expected that air traffic will gradually resume in the coming years and recover to its pre-crisis levels. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) estimates a growth in Europe of up to 3,1 % per year until 2050 for passenger traffic, and up to 2,4 % per year for freight traffic according to its post-COVID-19 forecast in a high traffic scenario. At the same time, emissions from air transport have been increasing since 1990 and the trend of increasing emissions could return as we overcome the pandemic. Therefore, it is imperative to prepare for the future and make the necessary adjustments ensuring a well-functioning air transport sector that contributes fully to achieving the Union’s climate goals, with high levels of connectivity, affordability, safety and security. The Union has established legal obligations under Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc3-L_202302405EN.000101-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_202302405EN.000101-E0003"

In order to achieve this, all economic sectors, including the transport sector, have to take rapid steps to decarbonise. For the air transport sector, this necessitates a strong ramp-up of the production, supply and uptake of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The functioning of the Union air transport sector is determined by its cross-border nature across the Union, and by its global dimension. The aviation market is one of the most integrated sectors in the internal market, governed by uniform rules on market access and operating conditions. The Union’s external air transport policy is governed by rules established at global level at ICAO, and in comprehensive multilateral or bilateral agreements between the Union or its Member States, and third countries. It is therefore important that the Union sustains the efforts made at international, multilateral and bilateral level to promote a high level of ambition and convergence in the uptake of SAF, while providing for an international level playing field.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The air transport market is subject to strong competition between economic actors globally and across the Union, for which a level playing field is indispensable. The stability and prosperity of the air transport market and its economic actors relies on a clear and harmonised policy framework where aircraft operators, airports and other aviation actors can operate on the basis of equal rules and opportunities, leading to a vibrant sector and to job opportunities. To a large extent intra-EU flights are part of global itineraries set in a global air transport market. The same is valid for itineraries from non-EU to non-EU destinations through European airports. Where market distortions occur, aircraft operators or airports are put at risk of a disadvantage with internal or external competitors. In turn, this can result in a loss of competitiveness of the air transport industry, putting air transport businesses and jobs at risk, and a loss of air connectivity and transport choices for citizens and businesses.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In particular, it is essential to ensure a level playing field across the Union air transport market regarding aviation fuel, which accounts for a substantial share of aircraft operators’ costs while fostering the decarbonisation of air transport by promoting SAF. Variations in aviation fuel prices can affect aircraft operators’ economic performance and negatively impact competition on the market. Higher aviation fuel prices translating directly into higher end-consumer fares would reduce the connectivity of regions, the mobility of citizens and the competitiveness of the air transport sector and also mobility. Where differences in aviation fuel prices exist between Union airports or between Union and non-Union airports, this can lead aircraft operators to adapt their refuelling strategies for economic reasons. Fuel tankering increases aircraft’s fuel consumption and results in unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel tankering by aircraft operators accordingly undermines the Union’s efforts towards environmental protection. Some aircraft operators are able to use favourable aviation fuel prices at their home bases as a competitive advantage towards other aircraft operators operating similar routes. This can have detrimental effects on the competitiveness of the air transport sector, leading to market distortions and harming air connectivity. This Regulation should set up measures to prevent such practices in order to avoid unnecessary environmental damage as well as to restore and preserve the conditions for fair competition on the Union air transport market.</p>

Sustainable development of air transport requires the introduction of measures, including economic instruments, aimed at reducing the carbon emissions from aircraft departing from Union airports and developing a market for the production and supply of SAF. Such measures should contribute to meeting the Union’s climate objectives by 2030 and 2050.</p>

The decarbonisation of the air transport sector is a necessary and challenging process, especially in the short term. Technological advancements, and a clear commitment from the aviation industry, pursued in European and national research and innovation programmes have contributed to important emission reductions in the past decades. However, the global growth of air traffic has outpaced the sector’s emissions reductions. Whereas new technologies, including the development of zero-emission electric- or hydrogen-powered aircraft, are expected to help reducing short-haul aviation’s reliance on fossil energy in the next decades and can play an important role in commercial aviation in the medium and long term, SAF offer a promising solution for significant decarbonisation of all flight ranges, both in the short, and in the medium and long term. However, this potential is currently largely untapped and needs support.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">SAF are aviation fuels that comprise liquid, drop-in fuels, fully fungible with conventional aviation fuels and compatible with existing aircraft engines. Several production pathways of SAF have been certified at global level for use in civil and military aviation. SAF are technologically ready to play an important role in reducing emissions from air transport already in the very short term. They are expected to account for a major part of the aviation fuels mix in the medium and long term. Further, with the support of appropriate international fuel standards, and support for the design of those standards, SAF might contribute to lowering the aromatics content of the final aviation fuel used by an aircraft operator, thus helping to reduce other non-CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions. Other aviation fuels such as electricity or hydrogen are promising technologies and are expected to progressively contribute to the decarbonisation of air transport, beginning with short-haul flights. This Regulation has the potential to further accelerate scientific development and deployment of these technologies, as well as boost commercial innovation in respect of them, by allowing economic operators to consider these technologies when they become mature and commercially available. It will also increase market certainty and predictability and act as an incentive for the investments in these new technologies that are necessary.</p>

As aviation is a relatively small fuels market for which renewable fuels are more costly to produce in comparison to other transport modes, and operates in a highly competitive and integrated Union air transport market, the regulatory framework should be complemented with aviation-specific measures to effectively boost the deployment of SAF. Further, national law transposing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 risks creating significant fragmentation in the Union air transport market, where national rules on SAF would set out widely differing targets.

It should not apply to aircraft such as military aircraft and flights used only for operations for humanitarian, repatriation and returns, whether voluntary or enforced, including readmissions, search, rescue, disaster relief or medical purposes, as well as for customs, police and fire-fighting operations. Indeed, flights operated in such circumstances are of exceptional nature and as such cannot always be planned in the same way as standard commercial air transport flights. Due to the nature of their operations, they might not always be in a position to fulfil obligations under this Regulation, as it might represent an unnecessary burden. In order to cater for a level playing field across the Union aviation market, this Regulation should cover the largest possible share of commercial air traffic operated from airports located on Union territory. At the same time and in order to safeguard air connectivity for the benefits of the citizens, businesses and regions of the Union, it is important to avoid imposing an undue burden on air transport operations at small airports. A threshold of yearly passenger air traffic and freight traffic should be defined, below which airports would not be covered by this Regulation; however, the scope of this Regulation should cover at least 95 % of total traffic departing from airports located on the Union territory. For the same reasons, a threshold should be defined to exclude from the scope aircraft operators accountable for a very low number of departures from airports located on Union territory.However, in order to achieve a higher level of ambition, Member States should be able to decide that an airport located on its territory, which does not reach the thresholds laid down in this Regulation or which is located in an outermost region as defined in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), is subject to this Regulation. An airport located on the Union territory that does not reach the thresholds laid down in this Regulation, or located in outermost regions, should be able to request the respective competent authorities to be treated as a Union airport and be subject to this Regulation. Moreover, a person operating commercial air transport flights that does not reach the thresholds laid down in this Regulation or a person operating flights other than commercial air transport flights using aviation turbine fuels should be able to decide to be treated as an aircraft operator for the purposes of this Regulation and therefore to be subject to this Regulation or that its non-commercial air transport flights be covered by this Regulation.</p>

This should support the creation of an innovative and competitive market for SAF and ensure the sufficient supply of SAF for aviation in the short and long term to contribute to Union transport decarbonisation ambitions, while strengthening the Union’s efforts towards a high level of environmental protection. Incentives on the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin in transport granted under other Union law will have a positive impact on the uptake of such fuels in aviation. A single, clear and robust sustainability framework is necessary to provide legal certainty and continuity for the aviation and fuels industries actors, on the eligibility of SAF under this Regulation. For this purpose, all aviation biofuels which comply with the sustainability and lifecycle emissions criteria laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and are certified in accordance with that Directive, with the exception of biofuels produced from ‘food and feed crops’ and certain feedstock listed in Article 4(5) of this Regulation, synthetic aviation fuels and recycled carbon aviation fuels complying with the lifecycle emissions savings threshold referred to in that Directive should be eligible. In that respect, to ensure consistency with other related Union policies, the eligibility of aviation biofuels, synthetic aviation fuels and recycled carbon aviation fuels should be based on the sustainability criteria and thresholds established in Directive (EU) 2018/2001.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">In particular, SAF produced from feedstock listed in Part B of Annex IX to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 are essential, as currently the most commercially mature technology to decarbonise air transport in the short term. The renewable share of fuels produced through co-processing should be eligible under the definition of SAF, as long as the renewable share is produced from feedstock listed in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 with the exception of biofuels produced from ‘food and feed crops’ as defined in that Directive, and of certain feedstock listed in Article 4(5) of this Regulation, determined in line with the methodology to be set out in a Commission delegated regulation adopted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Renewable hydrogen for aviation and low-carbon aviation fuels achieving at least same level of lifecycle emissions savings as synthetic aviation fuels can play a role in substituting conventional aviation fuels and support aviation decarbonisation and therefore should also be included within the scope of this Regulation.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">For sustainability reasons, feed and food crop-based aviation biofuels, including high indirect land-use change risk biofuels, should not be eligible. In particular, indirect land-use change occurs when the cultivation of crops for biofuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes. Such additional demand increases the pressure on land and can lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stock, such as forests, wetlands and peatland, causing additional greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity concerns. Research has shown that the scale of the effect depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstock used for fuel production, the level of additional demand for feedstock triggered by the use of biofuels and the extent to which land with high-carbon stock is protected worldwide. The highest risks of indirect land-use change have been identified for biofuels, fuels produced from feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed. Therefore, feed and food crop-based fuels should not be promoted. This approach is in line Union policy and in particular with Directive (EU) 2018/2001, which limits and sets a cap on the use of such biofuels in road and rail transport, considering their lower environmental benefits, lower performance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential and broader sustainability concerns. In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions linked to indirect land-use change – which is capable of negating some or all greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels – indirect land-use change also poses risks to biodiversity.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Those risks are particularly serious in connection with a potentially large expansion of production determined by a significant increase in demand. The air transport sector has currently insignificant levels of demand for food and feed crops-based biofuels, since over 99 % of currently used aviation fuels are of fossil origin. It is therefore appropriate to avoid the creation of a potentially large demand for food and feed crops-based biofuels by promoting their use under this Regulation. The non-eligibility of crop-based biofuels under this Regulation also minimises any risk to slow down the decarbonisation of road transport, which could otherwise result from a shift of crop-based biofuels from the road to the aviation sector. It is essential to minimise such a shift, as road transport currently remains by far the most pollutant transport sector.</p>

In order to promote consumer confidence and ensure transparency and traceability, aviation fuel suppliers should be responsible to provide the correct information with regards to the characteristics of the SAF supplied, its sustainability characteristics and the origin of the feedstock used in the production of SAF. That information should be reported in the Union database established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Aviation fuel suppliers that have been proven to have provided misleading or inaccurate information regarding the characteristics or origin of the SAF they supply should be subject to a penalty. Member States should ensure that aviation fuel suppliers enter timely and accurate information in the Union database and that that information is verified and audited. In order to combat possible fraud, including as concerns feedstock needed for the production of SAF imported from outside the Union, it is necessary for Member States, in cooperation with the relevant Union bodies, to strengthen the control mechanisms for shipments, including on-site audits, in accordance with relevant Union rules. In this respect, the Commission set out implementing rules on sustainability certification in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 in order to further harmonise and strengthen the rules on reliability, transparency and independent auditing as well as on cooperation of competent authorities of the Member States in audit supervision.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The present Regulation should aim at ensuring that aircraft operators can compete on the basis of equal opportunities as regards the access to SAF. To avoid any distortions on the Union air transport market, all Union airports should be supplied with uniform minimum shares of SAF. Whereas the market is free to supply and use larger quantities of SAF, this Regulation should ensure that the mandatory minimum shares of SAF are identical across all Union airports. In order to ensure clarity and legal certainty and in doing so encourage market development and deployment of the most sustainable and innovative aviation fuel technologies with growth potential to meet future needs, this Regulation should set out gradually increasing minimum shares of SAF, including of synthetic aviation fuels over time. Setting out dedicated minimum shares on synthetic aviation fuels as part of the minimum shares of SAF is necessary in view of the significant decarbonisation potential of such aviation fuels, and in view of their current estimated production costs. When produced from renewable electricity and carbon captured directly from the air, synthetic aviation fuels can achieve as much as 100 % emissions savings compared to conventional aviation fuel. They also have notable advantages compared to other types of SAF with regards to resource efficiency (in particular for water needs) of the production process. However, synthetic aviation fuels’ production costs are currently estimated at three to six times higher than the market price of conventional aviation fuel. Therefore, this Regulation should establish dedicated minimum shares for this technology.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Lack of common methodology, criteria and indicators adequately certified, reported and monitored allows aircraft operators to claim levels of emissions performance of their flights that cannot be compared with each other. Passengers need to be able to trust the information from aircraft operators regarding the sustainability of the aviation fuels which aircraft operators use and the sustainability of their flights to make informed choices when comparing between different flight options, both for direct and indirect flights, offered by aircraft operators. In order for consumers to be able to make an informed choice, more robust, reliable, independent and harmonised information is needed on the environmental impact of flights. Therefore, it is necessary to set up the criteria and indicators used to communicate the level of the emissions performance of their flights under a voluntary common environmental label (the ‘label’). It should be possible to update them easily to keep up with technological changes and international and European standards. Since some of the data necessary to calculate the level and quality of the SAF used and other criteria to measure the sustainability performance of a flight might be commercially sensitive, it is equally necessary that an independent body centralises the reports from the aircraft operators, monitors their data, certifies their accuracy and issues a label at the appropriate level. Considering the dynamic nature of data provided by aircraft operators, the label should be subject to periodic control and validation, such as at the end of each IATA season. Whenever necessary, that data would be based on estimations such as the average load factor for a given flight, route and season. Considering that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (the ‘Agency’) has monitoring and reporting obligations under this Regulation, it is appropriate that the Agency be the Union body in charge of the implementation of the label. It is therefore appropriate to provide the conditions for the issuance of the label to measure the environmental performance of aviation and, in order to ensure compliance with those conditions, to require the Agency to review them periodically.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">With the introduction and ramping-up of SAF at Union airports, practices of fuel tankering could be exacerbated as a consequence of aviation fuel cost increases. Tankering practices are unsustainable and should be avoided as they undermine the Union’s efforts to reduce the environmental impact from transport. Those would be contrary to the aviation decarbonisation objectives as increased aircraft weight would increase fuel consumption and related emissions on a given flight. Tankering practices also put at risk the level playing field in the Union between aircraft operators, and between airports. This Regulation should therefore require aircraft operators to refuel prior to the departure from a given Union airport. The amount of fuel uplifted prior to the departure from a given Union airport should be commensurate with the amount of fuel necessary to operate the flights departing from that airport. The requirement ensures that equal conditions apply to Union and foreign aircraft operators across the Union, while ensuring a high level of environmental protection. As the Regulation does not define maximum shares of SAF in all aviation fuels, aircraft operators and aviation fuel suppliers may pursue more ambitious environmental policies with higher SAF uptake and supply in their overall network of operations, while avoiding fuel tankering. Nevertheless, this Regulation should also take into account the fact that fuel tankering at times occurs in order to comply with fuel safety rules in line with Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 <a id="ntc8-L_202302405EN.000101-E0008" href="#ntr8-L_202302405EN.000101-E0008"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">8</span>)</a> and in such cases is justified by safety reasons. This may include for example cases of fuel shortage or fuel contamination at the destination airport confirmed by a Notice to Airmen or Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM). Furthermore, fuel tankering can be the consequence of specific operational difficulties for some aircraft operators at some airports, inter alia, in terms of disproportionate longer turnaround times for aircraft or reduced airport capacity at peak times. The Commission with the Agency should therefore closely monitor, evaluate and analyse reported cases of fuel tankering and their underlying reasons and, if appropriate, submit legislative proposals to amend this Regulation. This is without prejudice of the Commission’s and the Member States competition authorities’ power under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU to investigate and sanction anticompetitive behaviour by actors on the market to protect the proper functioning of the market for SAF, in particular, where information contained in the Union database and other data reported to the competent authorities reveal anticompetitive practices.</p>

However, reducing the aromatics content in aviation fuels needs to be done while adhering to international fuel safety rules and while preserving an international level playing field.

If necessary, the competent authorities of the Member State where the Union airport is located should be able to require the Union airport managing body to provide necessary information on compliance with this Regulation for the seamless distribution and refuelling of aircraft operators with SAF. The role of the competent authorities should allow the Union airport managing bodies and aircraft operators to have a common focal point, in the event that technical clarification is necessary regarding the availability of aviation fuel infrastructure. When electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft become mature and commercially available and where appropriate, it will be necessary that Union airport managing bodies, aviation fuel suppliers and fuel handlers covered by this Regulation, take all necessary measures to cooperate and facilitate access to the appropriate infrastructure for hydrogen and electric recharging for aircraft, in accordance with the respective national policy framework for alternative fuels infrastructure.</p>

The supply of SAF should start in 2025, with the flexibility provided for in the flexibility mechanism. During the application of the flexibility mechanism, aviation fuel suppliers may supply aviation fuel containing higher shares of SAF in certain airports to compensate for aviation fuels with lower shares of SAF in other airports or for the reduced availability of conventional aviation fuel at other airports.

For this purpose, the revenues generated by the fines under this Regulation should be allocated to SAF projects. Furthermore, the setting up of a European Industrial Alliance through a voluntary collaboration of stakeholders in the value chain aims to further foster SAF supply and uptake in Europe.</p>

This could be done, inter alia, by assessing the feasibility of setting-up a system of tradable SAF supply and purchase certificates, with elements of a book and claim scheme, while guaranteeing a level playing field and a high level of environmental integrity, ensuring consistency with other Union law, including Directives 2003/87/EC and 2009/28/EC, as well as minimising the risk of fraud, irregularities or double claiming. In its analysis, the Commission should take into consideration all relevant global trends and initiatives, as well as the potential impact that such a system could have on the functioning of the market, including with regards to any market volatility, price evolution or trading behaviour of market participants.</p>
