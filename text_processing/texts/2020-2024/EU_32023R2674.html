The conversion will enable that converted data network to support the development of evidence- and performance-based policies, as well as the analysis of agricultural sectors in the Member States and in the Union as a whole, gauging progress and providing valuable guidance to policy makers. The FSDN will contribute to the analysis of the enhanced economic, environmental and social dimensions of the CAP, to the improvement of advisory services to farmers and benchmarking of farm performance, and to the transparency and fairness of the agri-food supply chain.</p>

It is appropriate to lay down in an annex to Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 the main categories of economic, environmental and social data and, within those categories, the related data topics that can be collected and compiled in the FSDN. Those data topics should be linked to the needs of the CAP and should be relevant for the assessment of the sustainability of Union agriculture and holdings. In order to take into account future sustainability challenges, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending that annex, including by modifying topics and adding new ones, while taking into consideration the relevance of the data to be collected and compiled and the administrative burden on national authorities and holdings. Moreover, when adding new topics, the Commission should provide for a minimum period of at least one year before the application of the related implementing act on variables, in order to give sufficient time to Member States to prepare the data collection. In addition, the Commission should not add new topics in the first three years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.</p>

The definition of ‘individual data’ should reflect the concept that data of both natural persons and legal persons should be protected where such data make it possible to identify, directly or indirectly, those persons.

Moreover, it is necessary to collect harmonised data and to avoid duplication of data already collected, for example, through statistics on agricultural input and output or the CAP. In order to reduce the administrative burden on farmers and data collectors, with the aim of avoiding the duplication of data requests and data collection and of enriching the FSDN dataset, the principle of ‘collect data once and re-use them multiple times’ should be applied. Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc12-L_202302674EN.000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_202302674EN.000101-E0012"

In addition, the use of digital solutions, including re-use of data and data sharing with other sources, should be promoted and should always be considered as the first-choice solution, where it is conducive to the broad participation of farmers and the accuracy of data collected. For that purpose, developing or optimising available digital tools for data collection should be explored. A possible extension of the data collection system, when it is based exclusively on farm accountancy offices, should be provided for with a view to collecting environmental and social variables.</p>

The uses of FSDN data, and of the personal data included therein, should include the possibility to analyse long-term trends based on indicators, such as on nutrient management or emissions, the evolution of which needs to be assessed over a long period of time to keep pace with natural phenomena. Therefore, analyses should be regularly performed, especially on environmental information. Other subjects that imply the use of long-term analyses include land use and prices, which provide information about structural changes in farming. It should also be possible to build such long-term analyses based on sharing of data between different datasets established through linkages at individual level. Data sharing should enhance information availability, taking into consideration challenges that Union agriculture may face in the future. Such challenges are not possible to foresee at the current time, especially with regard to the future need for retrospective studies that cannot be established with sufficient certainty. Therefore, it is not appropriate to set a time limit for the use of data, but rather to keep data for as long as they are needed to perform time series analyses.</p>
