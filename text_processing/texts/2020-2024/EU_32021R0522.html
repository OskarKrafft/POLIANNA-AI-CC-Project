Experience from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that there is a need for further action at Union level to support cooperation and coordination among the Member States. That cooperation should improve preparedness for, and the prevention and control of, the spread of severe human infections and diseases across borders in order to combat other serious cross-border threats to health and to safeguard and improve the health and well-being of all people in the Union. Preparedness is the key to improving resilience to future threats. In that regard, Member States should be given the possibility of carrying out stress tests on a voluntary basis to improve preparedness and increase resilience.</p>

The Programme should also support capacity-building actions to strengthen strategic planning, access to multisource financing and the capacity to invest in and implement actions of the Programme. In that respect, the Programme should provide country-specific tailor-made assistance to the Member States, or groups of Member States, with the greatest needs.</p>

Such actions could include building capacity for responding to health crises, preventive measures related to vaccination and immunisation, strengthened surveillance programmes, provision of health information, and platforms to share best practices. In this context, the Programme should foster Union-wide and cross-sectoral crisis prevention, preparedness and surveillance, and the management capacity and response capacity of actors at Union and Member State levels, including contingency planning and preparedness exercises, in keeping with the ‘One Health’ and ‘Health in All Policies’ approaches. The Programme should facilitate the setting up of an integrated cross-cutting risk communication framework for all phases of a health crisis, namely prevention, preparedness and response.</p>

It is also one of the non-communicable diseases that share common risk factors and the prevention and control of which would benefit the majority of citizens. Poor nutrition, physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol are risk factors common to other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, and therefore cancer prevention programmes should be implemented within the context of an integrated approach to preventing chronic diseases. Relevant measures in the ‘Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan’ set out in the communication of the Commission of 3 February 2021 should benefit from the Programme and from Horizon Europe’s mission on cancer, and should contribute to fostering an integrated approach that covers prevention, screening, early diagnosis, monitoring, treatment and care, as well as improving the quality of life of patients and survivors.</p>

The Programme should therefore encourage the production of medicinal products and medical devices within the Union. In particular, in order to address unmet medical needs, the Programme should provide support to the generation of clinical and real-world evidence to enable the development of, authorisation of, evaluation of and access to effective medicinal products, including generics and biosimilars, to medical devices and to treatment, should promote research and development with respect to new medicinal products, with particular attention to be given to antimicrobials and vaccines to tackle antimicrobial resistance and vaccine-preventable diseases, respectively, should promote incentives to boost the production capacity for antimicrobials, personalised treatment and vaccination, and should foster the digital transformation of healthcare products and platforms for monitoring and collecting information on medicinal products. The Programme should also strengthen decision-making regarding medicinal products by enabling access to and the analysis of real-world healthcare data. The Programme should also help to ensure that the best use is made of research results and facilitate the uptake, scaling-up and deployment of health innovations in healthcare systems and clinical practice.</p>
