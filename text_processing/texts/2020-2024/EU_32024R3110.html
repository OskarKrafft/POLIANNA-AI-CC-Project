In addition, feedback received in the course of the evaluation has pointed to the need of reducing the overlaps, removing contradictions and repetitive requirements, including in relation to other Union legislation, in order to provide more legal clarity and limit the administrative burden on the economic operators. It is therefore necessary to update and align legal obligations of economic operators with those provided for in other Union legislation, as well as to add new provisions including as regards market surveillance, so that legal certainty is increased and that diverging interpretations are avoided.</p>

For a cleaner and more competitive Europe’. The Council Conclusions on the Circular Economy in the Construction Sector of 28 November 2019 urged the Commission to facilitate the circularity of construction products when revising Regulation (EU) No 305/2011. In its Communication of 10 March 2020 entitled ‘A New Industrial Strategy for Europe’ the Commission emphasised the need to address the sustainability of construction products and highlighted a more sustainable built environment as essential for Europe’s transition towards climate-neutrality. In its Communication of 5 May 2021 entitled ‘Updating the 2020 New Industrial Strategy: Building a stronger Single Market for Europe’s recovery’ the Commission identified construction as one of the priority ecosystems that face the most important challenges meeting climate and sustainability goals and embracing the digital transformation, and on which the competitiveness of the construction sector depends. It is therefore appropriate to lay down rules for declaring environmental sustainability performance of construction products, including the possibility of establishing relevant threshold levels and classes. Classes of performance for the environmental performance of products should accurately reflect the diversity of products and their state of the art and should allow for the most environmentally friendly products to be accurately identified. Moreover, when referring to environmental impacts, such classes of performance should be understandable, should not be misleading, nor allow for burden shifting.</p>

The calculations should cover the life cycle of the product using the methods established through standardisation. For new products the calculated life cycles should include all stages of a product’s life, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources, to its final disposal, including potential benefits and loads outside the boundary limits. For used and remanufactured products, the calculated life cycle should start with the deinstallation from a construction work and should include all following stages until final disposal. The Commission should make available software to perform the calculation, in particular the characterisation factors applicable in accordance with European standard EN 15804 or future applicable standards. Any update of this software should be communicated and should trigger the update to the relevant calculations within one year.</p>

However, since key parts are often integrated into various construction products, ensuring safety and the protection of the environment, including climate, would be better achieved if those key parts were assessed upstream, that is if their performance and conformity were assessed beforehand and independently from the assessment of the final construction product into which they are integrated. Similarly, market surveillance would be more efficient if non-compliant key parts could be identified and targeted. Therefore, it is necessary to lay down mandatory rules applicable to key parts of construction products. The same approach should be used for parts or materials intended to be used for construction products which would benefit from the voluntary application of the Regulation.</p>

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">11</span>)</a>, Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 does not provide for the possibility to establish such product requirements. However, certain harmonised standards for construction products contain such product requirements. Those standards demonstrate that there is a practical need for such requirements on functionality, safety, and protection of environment. Article 114 TFEU as the legal basis of this Regulation also imposes the pursuit of a high level of health, safety and protection of the environment. Thus, this Regulation should reintroduce or validate product requirements. Hence, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to specify those requirements for the respective product family or product category.</p>

For the same reason, an additional mechanism of prior authorisation should be established, allowing Member States to set, based on imperative grounds of health and safety of persons or of protection of the environment, requirements other than those laid down in the harmonised technical specifications for products covered by the harmonised zone. This mechanism should give Member States the possibility, while awaiting updated harmonised technical specifications addressing their regulatory needs, to notify and seek authorisation for national measures affecting the performance of an essential characteristic not addressed by the harmonised technical specification. This mechanism should be complementary to a Member State’s possibility to notify the Commission, in accordance with Article 114 TFEU, when it deems it necessary to introduce national provisions based on new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment on grounds of a problem specific to that Member State in contradiction with harmonised technical specifications. In order to ensure that authorised national measures only remain as temporary deviations from the harmonised zone, it is important to enable swift consultations on the need to update harmonised technical specifications in light of those regulatory needs, including, where appropriate, through standardisation requests with deadlines specifically set to address the urgency at hand.</p>

If a policy need is identified horizontally within the framework of Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, the Commission should primarily use this Regulation for addressing this need in regard to construction products. Only in exceptional cases where requirements under this Regulation are insufficient and cannot be amended or complemented in a reasonable time, it should be possible to apply Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 in a complementary manner to construction products, provided the administrative cost entailed, including as a result of economic operators potentially becoming subject to two conformity assessment procedures, is shown to be reasonable. As an exception, in the case of energy-related products included in ecodesign working plans which are also construction products and for intermediate products within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, with the exception of cement, priority for the setting of sustainability requirements will be given to that Regulation. This will be the case for instance for heaters, boilers, heat pumps, water and space heating appliances, fans, cooling and ventilating systems and photovoltaic products, excluding building-integrated photovoltaic panels. This Regulation would still apply in a complementary manner where needed, mainly in relation to safety aspects also taking account of other Union legislation on products such as on gas appliances, low voltage, and machinery. In the case of a conflict with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, the relevant provisions of this Regulation should prevail. For other products, in order to avoid unnecessary burden for economic operators, the need may arise to determine the conditions under which the fulfilment of obligations under other Union law also fulfils certain obligations under this Regulation.

The administrative burden on SMEs should be further minimised through targeted simplification provisions, including sharing test results, recognition of certificates, cascading of technical documentation and declaration without assessment, permitting micro-enterprises to use the more lenient assessment and verification system and reducing the requirements for custom-made non-series products. When such products are installed in an identified single construction work exemptions from the obligation to draw up a declaration of performance and conformity should be possible. In cases where a manufacturer fulfils the criteria for both the application of a simplified procedure and an exemption from the obligation to draw up a declaration of performance and conformity, it should be given the opportunity to choose one of them, or to provide a declaration of performance and conformity without applying the simplified procedure, so as to better adapt its offer to the needs of potential customers.</p>

In order to avoid market fragmentation and misleading claims resulting from the application of different assessment methods, the CE marking should be the only marking allowed on products covered by harmonised technical specification indicating that the product in question has been assessed in relation to the essential characteristics covered by harmonised technical specifications and is compliant with the applicable product requirements. The market for construction products faces a proliferation of markings which often create confusion and distrust among market players but also mislead consumers. The use of additional markings negatively impacts the probative value of the CE marking when based on assessment methods which are different than those defined in the relevant harmonised technical specifications. In addition, SMEs cannot always benefit from such markings, creating a distortion among market players and potentially hindering market access. Those additional markings should therefore not be affixed to the products in combination with the CE marking. However, this prohibition does not prevent products which bear other markings from being placed on the single market, providing such markings do not mislead the consumer or create confusion with the CE marking. In addition, the markings should not impair the visibility, legibility or meaning of the CE marking. As such, these markings should not display any information, text or claims in relation to the product’s performance.</p>

Such long use requires adequate design, use of reliable parts, reparability of products, availability of information on repair and access to spare parts. In the event that the spare parts are not commonly available in the market, the Commission should be empowered to require from the manufacturer to ensure the availability of these spare parts at a reasonable and non-discriminatory price for a period of 10 years which may be extended if the availability for a longer period of time is expected to increase the life span of the product.</p>

Preparing for reuse, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling require certain design, namely by facilitating the separation of products, components and materials at deinstallation, deconstruction and demolition and at the later stage of recycling and, when possible, avoiding mixed, blended or intricate materials and substances of concern. As the usual instructions for use and safety information will not necessarily reach the economic operators in charge of preparing for reuse, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling, the necessary information in this regard should be made available in digital product passports accessible through data carriers and in manufacturer’s websites.</p>

In addition to measures set out in this Regulation and under relevant Union law in favour of better market surveillance, the compliance of economic operators, bodies and products with this Regulation should be facilitated by also involving third parties such as by the possibility of any natural or legal person to submit information on instances of non-compliance through a complaint portal established and maintained by the Commission. The handling of complaints adheres to the right to good administration, as outlined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In handling the complaints the Commission should take into account the relevance and substantiation of the complaint by prioritising those complaints raising issues having particularly far-reaching negative impacts for citizens or the internal market. For a complaint to be considered substantiated the Commission should particularly check if the complaint manages to set out a grievance or if the grievance sets out an issue where the Commission has adopted a clear, public and consistent position which has been communicated to the complainant. The Commission should reply to the complainant without undue delay and efficiently transmit the complaints to the relevant Member States who should handle these complaints promptly and effectively in accordance with their legal frameworks and obligations.</p>

Moreover, there are situations where there is a non-compliance other than a formal one that does not trigger a risk. For these reasons, Member States should be empowered to act in all cases of suspected non-compliance or risk, whilst the definition of ‘product presenting a risk’ has to be extended to include risk for the environment. It is necessary to offer Member States enough procedural flexibility to distinguish between high and low priority cases of non-compliance, whilst all Member States should also be informed about less important cases.</p>

In duly justified cases, contracting authorities should be able to derogate from the requirements such as when there is only one supplier, there are no suitable tenders or its application would lead to a disproportionate cost.</p>
