                           <p class="oj-normal">In response to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the Union embarked on a wide-ranging reform of the prudential framework for institutions, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_202401623EN.000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_202401623EN.000101-E0004"

One of the main elements of the reform consisted of the implementation of the international standards agreed in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), specifically the so-called ‘Basel III reform’ and the resulting Basel III standards. Thanks to that reform, the Union banking sector entered the COVID-19 crisis on a resilient footing. However, while the overall level of capital in institutions in the Union is now generally satisfactory, some of the problems that were identified in the wake of the global financial crisis have yet to be addressed.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To address those problems, provide legal certainty and signal the commitment of the Union to its international partners in the G20, it is of utmost importance to implement faithfully in Union law the outstanding elements of the Basel III reform agreed in 2017 (the ‘finalised Basel III framework’). At the same time, the implementation should avoid a significant increase in overall capital requirements for the Union banking system as a whole and take into account specificities of the Union economy. Where possible, adjustments to the international standards should be applied on a transitional basis. The implementation should help avoid competitive disadvantages for institutions in the Union, in particular in the area of trading activities, where those institutions directly compete with their international peers. Moreover, with the implementation of the finalised Basel III framework, the Union completes a decade-long process of reform. In that context, the Union should carry out an overall assessment of its banking system, taking into account all relevant dimensions. The Commission should be mandated to perform a holistic review of the framework for prudential and supervisory requirements. That review should take into consideration the various types of corporate forms, structures and business models across the Union. That review should also take into account the implementation of the output floor as part of the prudential rules on capital and liquidity, as well as its level of application. The review should assess whether the output floor and its level of application ensure an adequate level of depositor protection and safeguard financial stability in the Union, taking into account both the Union-wide and banking union developments in all its dimensions. In that regard, the Commission shall duly consider the corresponding statements and conclusions on the banking union of both the European Parliament and the European Council.</p>

Standardised approaches require institutions to calculate the own funds requirements using fixed parameters, which are based on relatively conservative assumptions and laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Internal model approaches, that are to be approved by competent authorities, allow institutions to estimate for themselves most or all of the parameters required to calculate the own funds requirements. The BCBS decided in December 2017 to introduce an aggregate output floor. That decision was based on an analysis carried out in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, which revealed that internal models tend to underestimate the risks that institutions are exposed to, especially for certain types of exposures and risks, and hence, tend to result in insufficient own funds requirements. Compared to own funds requirements calculated using the standardised approaches, internal models produce, on average, lower own funds requirements for the same exposures.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The output floor represents one of the key measures of the Basel III reform. It aims to limit the unwarranted variability in the own funds requirements produced by internal models and the excessive reduction in capital that an institution using internal models can derive relative to an institution using the standardised approaches. By setting a lower limit on the own funds requirements that are produced by institutions’ internal models of 72,5 % of the own funds requirements that would apply if standardised approaches were used by those institutions, the output floor limits the risk of excessive reductions in capital. To that end, institutions using internal models should calculate two sets of total own funds requirements, with each set aggregating all own funds requirements without any double counting. Implementing the output floor faithfully would increase the comparability of institutions’ capital ratios, restore the credibility of internal models and ensure that there is a level playing field between institutions that use different approaches to calculate their own funds requirements.</p>

In such cases, a Member State should be able to decide not to apply the output floor on an individual or sub-consolidated basis to institutions in that Member State, provided that, at the highest level of consolidation in that Member State, the parent institution of those institutions in that Member State complies with the output floor on the basis of its consolidated situation.</p>

Institutions in the Union have long-standing, strategic equity investments in financial and non-financial corporates. As the standard risk weight for equity exposures increases over a five-year transitional period, existing strategic equity holdings in corporates and certain insurance undertakings under the control or significant influence of the institution should be grandfathered to avoid disruptive effects and to preserve the role of institutions in the Union as long-standing, strategic equity investors. Given the prudential safeguards and supervisory oversight to foster integration of the financial sector, for equity holdings in other institutions within the same group or covered by the same institutional protection scheme, the current regime should be maintained. In addition, to reinforce private and public initiatives to provide long-term equity to unlisted Union companies, investments undertaken directly or indirectly, for instance through venture capital firms, should not be considered speculative where those investments are made with the firm intention of the senior management to hold them for at least three years.</p>

Compliance with those criteria should be verified by competent authorities.

In the case of a revaluation above the value at the time the loan was granted, provided that there is sufficient data, the value of the immovable property recognised for prudential purposes should therefore not exceed the average value of a comparable property measured over a sufficiently long period, unless modifications to that property unequivocally increase its value. To avoid unintended consequences for the functioning of the covered bond markets, competent authorities should be able to allow institutions to revalue immovable property on a regular basis without applying those limits to value increases. Modifications that improve the energy performance or the resilience, protection and adaptation to physical risks of buildings and housing units could be considered as increasing the value of the immovable property.</p>

The contractual arrangements of the specialised lending model provide the lender with a substantial degree of control over the assets being financed, while the primary source of repayment for the obligation is the income generated by those assets. To reflect the associated risk more accurately, that form of lending should therefore be subject to specific own funds requirements for credit risk. In line with the Basel III standards on assigning risk weights to specialised lending exposures, a dedicated specialised lending exposures class should be introduced under the SA-CR, thereby improving consistency with the already existing specific treatment of specialised lending exposures under the IRB Approach. A specific treatment for specialised lending exposures should be introduced, whereby a distinction should be made between ‘project finance’, ‘object finance’ and ‘commodity finance’ to better reflect the inherent risks of those sub-classes of the specialised lending exposures class.</p>

Due to the lack of external rating coverage of specialised lending exposures in the Union, that new treatment might also create incentives for institutions to stop financing certain projects or take on higher risks in otherwise similarly treated exposures which have different risk profiles. Whereas the specialised lending exposures are mostly financed by institutions using the IRB Approach that have in place internal models for those exposures, the impact might be particularly significant in the case of object finance exposures, which could be at risk of discontinuation of the activities, in the particular context of the application of the output floor. To avoid unintended consequences of the lack of risk sensitivity in the Basel III standards for unrated object finance exposures, object finance exposures that comply with a set of criteria capable of lowering their risk profile to high quality standards compatible with prudent and conservative management of financial risks, should benefit from a reduced risk weight on a transitional basis.

It is therefore appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which institutions should be able to continue to apply a lower credit conversion factor to their unconditionally cancellable commitments, and, afterwards, to assess whether a potential gradual increase of the applicable credit conversion factors is warranted to allow institutions to adjust their operational practices and products without hampering credit availability to institutions’ obligors.</p>

For such low-default portfolios, it is difficult for institutions to obtain reliable estimates of the loss given default (LGD), due to an insufficient number of observed defaults in those portfolios. That difficulty has resulted in an undesirable level of dispersion across institutions in the level of estimated risk. Institutions should therefore use regulatory LGD values rather than internal LGD estimates for those low-default portfolios.</p>

Such minimum values for risk parameters (‘input floors’) should constitute a safeguard to ensure that own funds requirements do not fall below prudent levels. In addition, such input floors should mitigate model risk due to factors such as incorrect model specification, measurement error and data limitations. Input floors would also improve the comparability of capital ratios across institutions.

Although such positions are generally small relative to other exposures, the introduction of the output floor could affect the economic viability of the securitisation operation because of an insufficient prudential benefit of the transfer of risk. This could occur where the development of the securitisation market is part of the action plan on the capital markets union set out in the communication of the Commission of 24 September 2020 entitled ‘A Capital Markets Union for people and businesses — new action plan’ (the ‘capital markets union action plan’) and also where originator institutions might need to use securitisation more extensively in order to manage more actively their portfolios if they become bound by the output floor. During a transitional period, institutions using the Securitisation Internal Ratings Based Approach or the Internal Assessment Approach should be able to apply a favourable treatment for the purpose of calculating their output floor to their securitisation positions that are risk weighted using either of those Approaches. EBA should report to the Commission on the need to possibly review the prudential treatment of securitisation transactions, with a view to increasing the risk sensitivity of the prudential treatment.</p>

The implementation of the final FRTB standards should therefore converge as much as possible across jurisdictions, both in terms of substance and timing. Otherwise, it would be impossible to ensure an international level playing field for those activities. The Commission should therefore monitor the implementation of the final FRTB standards in other BCBS member jurisdictions. In order to address, where necessary, potential distortions in the implementation of the final FRTB standards, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making <a id="ntc10-L_202401623EN.000101-E0010" href="#ntr10-L_202401623EN.000101-E0010"

In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. The measures introduced by means of delegated acts should remain temporary. Where it is appropriate for such measures to apply on a permanent basis, the Commission should submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p>

Under the Basel III standards, an instrument and its hedge can be netted for the purposes of that charge only if they perfectly offset. However, institutions are able to hedge in the market, to a large extent, the residual risk of some of the instruments within the scope of the residual risk add-on charge thus reducing the overall risk of their portfolios, even though those hedges might not perfectly offset the risk of the initial position. To allow institutions to continue hedging without undue disincentives and in recognition of the economic rationale of reducing the overall risk, the implementation of the residual risk add-on charge should allow on a temporary basis, under strict conditions and supervisory approval, for the hedges of those instruments that can be hedged in the market to be excluded from the residual risk add-on charge.</p>

Besides a lack of risk sensitivity in the standardised approaches, a lack of comparability arising from a wide range of internal modelling practices under the advanced measurement approach was identified. Therefore, and in order to simplify the operational risk framework, all existing approaches for estimating the own funds requirements for operational risk were replaced by a single non-model-based method, namely the new standardised approach for operational risk. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be aligned with the finalised Basel III framework to contribute to a level playing field internationally for institutions established in the Union but operating also outside the Union, and to ensure that the operational risk framework at Union level remains effective.</p>

The finalised Basel III framework envisages a degree of discretion as to how the indicator that takes into account the loss history of an institution may be implemented. Jurisdictions are able to disregard historical losses for calculating the own funds requirements for operational risk for all relevant institutions, or to take historical loss data into account even for institutions below a certain business size. To ensure a level playing field within the Union and to simplify the calculation of own funds requirements for operational risk, that discretion should be exercised in a harmonised manner for the minimum own funds requirements by disregarding historical operational loss data for all institutions.</p>

Against that background, some targeted changes should be applied to NPEs guaranteed by export credit agencies or public guarantors.

Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should reflect the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and a full understanding of the risks of exposures to activities that are linked to overall sustainability or ESG objectives. To ensure convergence across the Union and a uniform understanding of ESG factors and risks, general definitions should be laid down. ESG factors can have a positive or negative impact on the financial performance or solvency of an entity, sovereign or individual. Common examples of ESG factors include greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and water use and consumption in the environment area; human rights, and labour and workforce considerations in the social area; and rights and responsibilities of senior staff members and remuneration in the governance area. Assets or activities subject to the impact of environmental or social factors should be defined by reference to the ambition of the Union to become climate-neutral by 2050 as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc12-L_202401623EN.000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_202401623EN.000101-E0012"

                           <p class="oj-normal">Exposures to ESG risks are not necessarily proportional to an institution’s size and complexity. The levels of exposures to ESG risks across the Union are also quite heterogeneous, with some Member States showing a potential mild transitional impact and others showing a potential high transitional impact on exposures related to activities that have a significant negative impact, in particular on the environment. The transparency requirements that institutions are subject to and the disclosure requirements with regard to sustainability laid down in other existing Union legal acts will provide more granular data in a few years’ time. However, to properly assess the ESG risks that institutions might face, it is imperative that markets and competent authorities obtain adequate data from all entities exposed to those risks. Institutions should be in a position to systematically identify and ensure adequate transparency as regards their exposures to activities that are deemed to do significant harm to one of the environmental objectives within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. In order to ensure that competent authorities have at their disposal data that are granular, comprehensive and comparable for the purposes of an effective supervision, information on exposures to ESG risks should be included in the supervisory reporting of institutions. To guarantee comprehensive transparency towards the markets, disclosures of ESG risks should also be extended to all institutions. The granularity of that information should be consistent with the principle of proportionality, having regard to the size and complexity of the institution concerned and the materiality of its exposures to ESG risks. When revising the implementing technical standards as regards the disclosure of ESG risks, EBA should assess means to enhance disclosures of ESG risks of cover pools of covered bonds and consider whether information on the relevant exposures of the pools of loans underlying covered bonds issued by institutions, whether directly or through the transfer of loans to a special purpose entity, should either be included in the revised implementing technical standards or in the regulatory and disclosure framework for covered bonds.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">As the transition of the Union economy towards a sustainable economic model gains momentum, sustainability risks become more prominent and potentially require further consideration. An appropriate assessment of the availability and accessibility of reliable and consistent ESG data should form the basis for establishing a full link between ESG risk drivers and traditional categories of financial risks and sets of exposures. ESMA should also contribute to that evidence gathering by reporting on whether ESG risks are appropriately reflected in credit risk ratings of the counterparties or exposures that institutions might have. In a context of rapid and continuous developments around identification and quantification of ESG risks by both institutions and supervisors, it is also necessary to bring forward to the date of entry into force of this Regulation part of EBA’s mandate to assess and report on whether a dedicated prudential treatment of exposures related to assets or activities substantially associated with environmental or social objectives would be justified. The existing EBA mandate should be broken into a series of reports due to the length and complexity of the assessment work to be conducted. Therefore, two successive and annual follow-up EBA reports should be prepared by the end of 2024 and 2025, respectively. According to the International Energy Agency, to reach the carbon neutrality objective by 2050, no new fossil fuel exploration and expansion can take place. That means that fossil fuel exposures are prone to representing a higher risk both at the micro level, as the value of such assets is set to decrease over time, and at the macro level, as financing fossil fuel activities jeopardises the objective of limiting the increase in the global temperature to 1,5 <span class="oj-super">o</span>C above pre-industrial levels and therefore threatens financial stability. Competent authorities and market participants should, therefore, benefit from increased transparency by institutions on their exposures towards fossil fuel sector entities, including their activity in respect of renewable energy sources.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">It is essential for supervisors to have the necessary powers to assess and measure in a comprehensive manner the risks to which a banking group is exposed at a consolidated level and to have the flexibility to adapt their supervisory approaches to new sources of risk. It is important to avoid loopholes between prudential and accounting consolidation which can give rise to transactions that aim to move assets out of the scope of prudential consolidation, even though risks remain in the banking group. The lack of coherence in the definitions of ‘parent undertaking’, ‘subsidiary’ and ‘control’, and the lack of clarity in the definition of ‘ancillary services undertaking’, ‘financial holding company’ and ‘financial institution’ make it more difficult for supervisors to apply the applicable rules consistently in the Union and to detect and appropriately address risks at a consolidated level. Those definitions should therefore be amended and further clarified. In addition, it is deemed appropriate for EBA to investigate further whether those powers of the supervisors might be unintendedly constrained by any remaining discrepancies or loopholes in the regulatory provisions or in their interaction with the applicable accounting framework.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Markets in crypto-assets have grown rapidly in recent years. To address potential risks for institutions caused by their crypto-asset exposures that are not sufficiently covered by the existing prudential framework, the BCBS published in December 2022 a comprehensive standard for the prudential treatment of crypto-asset exposures. The recommended date of application of that standard is 1 January 2025, but some technical elements of the standard were being further developed at BCBS level during 2023 and 2024. In light of ongoing developments in markets in crypto-assets and acknowledging the importance of fully implementing the Basel standard on institutions’ crypto-asset exposures in Union law, the Commission should submit a legislative proposal by 30 June 2025 to implement that standard, and should specify the prudential treatment applicable to those exposures during the transitional period until the implementation of that standard. The transitional prudential treatment should take into account the legal framework introduced by Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc14-L_202401623EN.000101-E0014" href="#ntr14-L_202401623EN.000101-E0014"

Therefore, during the transitional period, tokenised traditional assets, including e-money tokens, should be recognised as entailing similar risks to traditional assets and crypto-assets compliant with that Regulation and referencing traditional assets other than a single fiat currency should benefit from a prudential treatment consistent with the requirements of that Regulation. Exposures to other crypto-assets, including tokenised derivatives on crypto-assets different from the ones that qualify for the more favourable capital treatment, should be assigned a 1 250 % risk weight.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The lack of clarity of certain aspects of the minimum haircut floor framework for securities financing transactions, developed by the BCBS as part of the finalised Basel III framework, as well as reservations about the economic justification of applying it to certain types of securities financing transactions, have raised the question of whether the prudential objectives of that framework can be attained without creating undesirable consequences. The Commission should therefore reassess the implementation of the minimum haircut floor framework for securities financing transactions in Union law. In order to provide the Commission with sufficient evidence, EBA, in close cooperation with ESMA, should report to the Commission on the impact of that framework, and on the most appropriate approach for its implementation in Union law.</p>

As a result, and given as well the introduction of the output floor, the own funds requirements calculated for those exposures could significantly increase, affecting the liquidity of debt and securities markets, including the sovereign debt markets. EBA should therefore report on the appropriateness and the impact of the credit risk standards for securities financing transactions, and specifically whether an adjustment of the SA-CR for those exposures would be warranted to reflect their short-term nature.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">When implementing the initial Basel III standards on the treatment of CVA risk in Union law, certain transactions were exempted from the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk. Those exemptions were agreed in order to prevent a potentially excessive increase in the cost of some derivative transactions triggered by the introduction of the own funds requirements for CVA risk, particularly when institutions could not mitigate the CVA risk of certain clients that were unable to exchange collateral. According to the estimated impact calculated by EBA, the own funds requirements for CVA risk under the revised Basel III standards would remain unduly high for exempted transactions with those clients. To ensure that those clients continue hedging their financial risks via derivative transactions, the exemptions should be maintained when implementing the revised Basel III standards.</p>

If those risks materialise, the institutions concerned could suffer significant losses. As EBA highlighted in its report on CVA of 25 February 2015, the CVA risk of the exempted transactions raises prudential concerns that are not addressed in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. To help supervisors monitor the CVA risk arising from the exempted transactions, institutions should report the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk of the exempted transactions that would be required if those transactions were not exempted. In addition, EBA should develop guidelines to help supervisors identify excessive CVA risk and to improve the harmonisation of supervisory actions in that area across the Union.</p>

In such cases of a reduction of risk sensitivities, EBA may consider proposing a downward recalibration of the non-neutrality factors for transactions for which a significant risk transfer has been recognised. EBA shall also assess the appropriateness of the non-neutrality factors under both the SEC-SA and the SEC-IRBA, taking into account the historic credit performance of securitisation transactions in the Union and the reduced model and agency risks of the securitisation framework.</p>
