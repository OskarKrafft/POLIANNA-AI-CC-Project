The Commission’s Communication of 22 November 2016 entitled ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future: European action for sustainability’ links the SDGs to the Union policy framework to ensure that all Union actions and policy initiatives, both within the Union and globally, take the SDGs on board at the outset. The European Council conclusions of 22 and 23 June 2017 confirmed the commitment of the Union and the Member States to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in a full, coherent, comprehensive, integrated and effective manner and in close cooperation with partners and other stakeholders. In addition, the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment has, at the time of adoption of this Regulation, more than 5 300 signatories representing over EUR 120 trillion of assets under management. On 11 December 2019, the Commission published its communication entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ (the ‘European Green Deal’). On 30 June 2021, the European Climate Law was adopted as Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc3-L_202403005EN.000101-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_202403005EN.000101-E0003"

It is necessary to fully exploit the potential of the internal market for the achievement of those objectives. In that context, it is crucial to remove obstacles to the efficient movement of capital towards sustainable investments in the internal market, to prevent such obstacles from emerging, and to set rules and standards to, on the one hand, promote sustainable finance and, on the other, disincentivise investments that can adversely impact the achievement of the objectives of the SDGs.</p>

That study provided an inventory and classification of market actors, sustainability products and services available in the market and an analysis of the use and perceived quality of sustainability-related products and services by market participants. The study highlighted the existence of conflicts of interest, the lack of transparency and accuracy of environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings methodologies and the lack of clarity over the terminology and the operations of ESG rating providers.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">ESG ratings play an important role in global capital markets, as investors, borrowers and issuers increasingly use ESG ratings as part of the process of making informed decisions relating to sustainable investment and financing. Credit institutions, investment firms, insurance undertakings, assurance undertakings and reinsurance undertakings, amongst others, often use ESG ratings as a reference for the sustainability performance or the sustainability risks and opportunities in their investment activity. Consequently, ESG ratings have a significant impact on the operation of markets and on the trust and confidence of investors and consumers. To ensure that ESG ratings used in the Union are independent, comparable where possible, impartial, systematic and of adequate quality, it is important that ESG rating activities are conducted in accordance with the principles of integrity, transparency, responsibility and good governance, while contributing to the sustainable finance agenda of the Union. Better comparability and increased reliability of ESG ratings would enhance the efficiency of that fast-growing market, thereby facilitating progress towards the objectives of the European Green Deal.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">It is necessary to acknowledge the various business models of the ESG rating market. A first business model is the user-paid model, where users of ESG ratings are mainly investors that purchase ESG ratings for the purpose of making investment decisions. A second business model is the issuer-paid model, where undertakings purchase ESG ratings for the purpose of assessing risks and opportunities within their operations. In order to ensure greater reliability of ESG ratings provided in the Union, rated items or, in the case of a financial instrument or a financial product, issuers of rated items should have the possibility of verifying the data used by an ESG rating provider and of highlighting any factual errors in the dataset used that could potentially impact the quality of future ratings. To that end, a rated item or an issuer of a rated item should be able to access, upon request, the dataset used to issue the ESG rating. The possibility of verifying that dataset should be a pure fact-checking tool and rated items or issuers of rated items should under no circumstances be able to influence in any manner the rating methodologies or rating outcome. The requirement for an ESG rating provider to notify the rated item or the issuer of a rated item before the issuance of the ESG rating should only apply before the first issuance of the rating and not to any following updates. That requirement serves as a means to inform the rated item or the issuer of a rated item that it is going to be rated by the ESG rating provider.</p>

Given the existing divergences, lack of transparency and absence of common rules, it is likely that Member States would adopt diverging measures and approaches impeding alignment with the objectives of the SDGs and the European Green Deal. Those diverging measures and approaches would have a direct negative impact on, and create obstacles to, the proper functioning of the internal market and be detrimental to the ESG rating market. ESG rating providers issuing ESG ratings for the use of financial institutions and undertakings in the Union would be subject to different rules in different Member States. Divergent standards and market practices would make it difficult to have clarity over the construction of ESG ratings and to compare them, thus creating uneven market conditions for users of ESG ratings. That would cause additional barriers within the internal market and would risk distorting investment decisions.</p>

Other regulated financial undertakings in the Union should disclose the same information, taking into account the various types of financial products, their characteristics and the differences between them, as well as the need to avoid any duplication of information already published pursuant to other applicable regulatory requirements. In general, any duplication of applicable disclosure requirements should be avoided. With that same objective, regulated financial undertakings in the Union that issue ESG ratings and incorporate those ratings in the financial products or services that they offer to third parties should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.</p>

Those rules would apply to overall ESG ratings capturing environmental, social and governance factors, and to ratings that only assess a single environmental, social or governance factor or a sub-component of such a factor. Separate environmental (E), social (S) and governance (G) ratings should be provided rather than a single ESG rating that aggregates E, S and G factors.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Given the use of ESG ratings from providers established outside the Union, and in order to ensure market integrity, investor protection and proper enforcement of this Regulation, it is necessary to introduce requirements based on which ESG rating providers established outside the Union may offer their services in the Union. Therefore, three possible regimes are proposed for ESG rating providers established outside the Union: equivalence, endorsement and recognition. As a rule, supervision and regulation in a third country should be equivalent to Union supervision and regulation of ESG ratings. Therefore, ESG ratings provided by an ESG rating provider established outside the Union and authorised or registered as such in a third country should only be offered in the Union where a positive decision on equivalence of the third-country regime has been taken by the Commission. However, to avoid any adverse impact resulting from a possible abrupt cessation of the offering in the Union of ESG ratings provided by an ESG rating provider established outside the Union, it is necessary to provide for certain other regimes, namely of endorsement and recognition. Any ESG rating provider with a group structure should be able to use the endorsement regime for ESG ratings developed outside the Union. To do so, it should establish, within the group structure, an authorised ESG rating provider in the Union. That authorised ESG rating provider should ensure that the issuance and distribution of endorsed ESG ratings fulfils requirements which are at least as stringent as the requirements of this Regulation. Additionally, the ESG rating provider established in the Union should possess the necessary expertise to effectively monitor the issuance and distribution of ESG ratings provided by the ESG rating provider established outside the Union and there should be an objective reason why the endorsed ratings are issued by a provider established outside the Union. The requirement to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation should not be proven for each individual endorsed ESG rating but rather for the overall methodologies and procedures implemented by the ESG rating provider. For their part, ESG rating providers that are categorised as small undertakings or small groups according to the criteria laid down in Directive 2013/34/EU (‘small ESG rating providers’) should be able to benefit from the recognition regime. Where an ESG provider established outside the Union is subject to supervision in a third country, appropriate cooperation arrangements should be put in place in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information with the relevant third-country competent authority.</p>

ESG rating providers should also clearly disclose whether the rating addresses other dimensions. For the same reason, ESG rating providers should provide more detailed information on the methodologies, models and key rating assumptions to users of ESG ratings. That information should enable users of ESG ratings to perform their own due diligence when assessing whether to rely on those ESG ratings. Disclosure of information concerning methodologies, models and key rating assumptions should however not reveal sensitive business information or impede innovation.

                           <p class="oj-normal">ESG rating providers should ensure that they provide ESG ratings that are independent, impartial, systematic and of adequate quality. It is important to introduce organisational requirements ensuring the prevention and mitigation of potential conflicts of interest. To ensure their independence, ESG rating providers should avoid situations of conflict of interest and manage such conflicts adequately where they are unavoidable. ESG rating providers should disclose conflicts of interest in a timely manner. They should also keep records of all significant threats to their independence and that of their employees and other persons involved in the rating process, and of the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats. In addition, to avoid potential conflicts of interest, ESG rating providers should not be allowed to offer from within the same entity a number of other activities including consulting services, credit ratings, benchmarks, investment activities, auditing, activities of credit institutions or insurance and reinsurance activities. Finally, to prevent, identify, eliminate or manage and disclose any conflicts of interest and ensure at all times the quality, integrity and thoroughness of the ESG rating and review process, ESG rating providers should establish appropriate internal policies and procedures in relation to employees and other persons involved in the rating process. Such policies and procedures should, in particular, include internal control mechanisms and an oversight function.</p>

However, some of those activities could be offered from within the same legal entity where the ESG rating provider concerned has sufficient measures and procedures in place to ensure that each activity is exercised autonomously and to avoid creating potential risks of conflicts of interest in decision-making within its ESG rating activities. Such derogation should not be possible for credit rating activities and for auditing and consulting activities. Consulting activities include developing sustainability strategies and strategies to manage sustainability risks or impacts. With respect to the activity of the provision of benchmarks, ESMA should assess whether the measures proposed by the ESG rating provider are appropriate and sufficient regarding the potential risks of conflict of interest. Such an assessment should take into account whether the benchmark administrator offers benchmarks that pursue sustainability objectives and in particular EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc14-L_202403005EN.000101-E0014" href="#ntr14-L_202403005EN.000101-E0014"

                           <p class="oj-normal">It is necessary to have in place a number of measures supporting small ESG rating providers to enable them to continue their activities, or to enter the market after the date of application of this Regulation. Against that background, a temporary regime should be introduced to facilitate the market entry of small ESG rating providers and support the development of existing small ESG rating providers already operating in the Union before the entry into force of this Regulation. Under that temporary regime, small ESG rating providers should register with ESMA, without the need to obtain authorisation to operate in the Union, and should only be subject to the provisions of this Regulation regarding organisational and transparency requirements. ESMA should be empowered to request information and to conduct general investigations and on-site inspections, as well as to adopt administrative measures. ESMA should ensure that risks of circumvention of this Regulation are avoided, particularly by preventing small undertakings within medium-sized or large groups according to the criteria laid down in Directive 2013/34/EU from benefitting from the temporary regime. Once the temporary regime comes to an end, small ESG rating providers should apply for authorisation to operate in the Union and benefit from proportionate governance requirements and supervisory fees proportionate to the annual net turnover of the ESG rating provider concerned.</p>
