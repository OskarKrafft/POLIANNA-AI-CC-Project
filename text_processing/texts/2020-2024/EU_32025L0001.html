                           <p class="oj-normal">The global financial crisis of 2008 exposed the vulnerabilities of the financial sector and its interconnectedness. Causes of distress and failure appeared to be linked to, inter alia, the evolution of financial markets and the intrinsic nature of insurance or reinsurance activities. In that regard, underwriting risks, that is under-provisioned claims, mispricing, that is underestimated premiums, asset-liability mismanagement and investment losses are often referred to as main sources of concern for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. In that context, taxpayer money has been used to restore the deteriorated financial conditions of several insurance undertakings. Although Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc3-L_202500001EN.000101-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_202500001EN.000101-E0003"

High market volatilities and prolonged low levels of interest rates could be particularly harmful for the profitability and solvency position of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. The sensitivity of insurance and reinsurance undertakings to market and economic developments therefore calls for particular caution and an adequate framework to manage, including in a pre-emptive manner, potential deteriorations of the financial position of such undertakings. Some recent failures and near-failures, in particular of a cross-border nature, illustrated weaknesses of the current framework that need to be addressed to organise adequately the orderly exit from the market of insurance or reinsurance undertakings.</p>

Such activities, services or operations can be critical at Union, national or regional level. The continuity of insurance or reinsurance protection is often preferable to the winding down of a failing undertaking as such continuity delivers the most favourable outcome for policy holders, beneficiaries or injured parties. It is therefore crucial that adequate tools be available to prevent failures and, where failures occur, to minimise negative repercussions by preserving the continuity of those critical functions.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Ensuring effective resolution of failing insurance and reinsurance undertakings within the Union is an essential element in the completion of the internal market. The failure of such undertakings has an impact not only on policy holders and possibly the real economy and financial stability of the markets on which those insurance and reinsurance undertakings operate directly, but also on the trust in the internal market for insurance. The completion of the internal market in financial services has reinforced the interplay between the different national financial systems. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are active on financial markets to manage their investment portfolio and the risks related to their activities. In that context, the inability of Member States to address the failure of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking and resolve it in a way that is predictable and harmonised and would effectively prevent broader systemic damage, can undermine the stability of financial markets and, consequently, the internal market in the field of financial services.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The global financial crisis of 2008 highlighted the need to develop an appropriate recovery and resolution framework for insurance and reinsurance undertakings. At international level, the Financial Stability Board published in October 2011, and updated in October 2014, the document ‘Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions’, encompassing considerations on the resolution of any insurance undertaking that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails. In June 2016, the Financial Stability Board released complementary guidance on developing effective resolution strategies and plans for systemically important insurers. In parallel, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors adopted in November 2019 ‘Insurance Core Principles’ for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings, a ‘Common Framework for Internationally Active Insurance Groups’ detailing standards for pre-emptive recovery planning, and actions that authorities are expected to take towards an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that would exit the market and enter into resolution. Those developments should be taken into account when laying down a framework for the recovery and resolution of failing insurance and reinsurance undertakings.</p>

Such framework should ensure that shareholders bear losses first and that creditors bear losses after shareholders, provided that no creditor incurs greater losses than they would have incurred if the insurance or reinsurance undertaking had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings in accordance with the principle that no creditor should be worse off than under normal insolvency proceedings (the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle). In order to ensure that the treatment that affected shareholders, policy holders, beneficiaries, claimants and other creditors would have received if the undertaking under resolution had entered into normal insolvency proceedings is accurately reflected, all the relevant occurrences that would be triggered either by or before the opening of normal insolvency proceedings as well as all the relevant occurrences related to the opening of such proceedings, including those linked to the protection of injured parties under Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_202500001EN.000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_202500001EN.000101-E0004"

Those objectives should help avoid unnecessary losses or social hardship falling on policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, mitigate negative impacts on the real economy, minimise negative effects on financial markets and minimise the costs for taxpayers.</p>

Nevertheless, despite a sound and robust prudential framework, situations of financial distress cannot be completely excluded. Member States should therefore be prepared and have adequate recovery and resolution tools in place to handle situations involving both systemic crises and failures of individual undertakings. Such tools should include mechanisms that enable authorities to deal effectively with undertakings that are failing or likely to fail. The use of such tools and the exercise of such powers should take into account the circumstances in which the failure occurs.</p>

However, the absence of common conditions, powers and processes for the recovery and resolution of insurance or reinsurance undertakings across the Union is likely to constitute a barrier to the smooth operation of the internal market and hinder cooperation between national authorities when dealing with distressed or failing cross-border groups of undertakings. That is particularly true where different approaches mean that national authorities do not have the same level of control or the same ability to resolve insurance or reinsurance undertakings. Those differences in recovery and resolution regimes might affect the level playing field and potentially create distortions of competition between undertakings. That barrier should be eliminated and rules should be adopted to ensure that the internal market is not undermined. To that end, rules governing the pre-emptive recovery and resolution of insurance or reinsurance undertakings should be made subject to common minimum harmonisation rules. In order to ensure consistency with existing Union legislation in the area of insurance services, the pre-emptive recovery and resolution regime should apply to insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are subject to the prudential requirements laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC.</p>

It is therefore necessary to have in place group pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning requirements.

The pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning and resolvability requirements and the resolution regime should therefore also apply to parent undertakings, holding companies and other group entities, including branches of insurance and reinsurance undertakings that are established outside the Union.</p>

The timescale of a resolution in an insurance and reinsurance context is different from a resolution in a banking context. In order to prevent a bank run, the Single Resolution Board and national banking resolution authorities typically need to act swiftly. Insurance and reinsurance resolution authorities, on the other hand, often have the benefit of having more time to find the proper solutions that are most beneficial for policy holders. An event similar to a bank run is less likely to happen in the insurance and reinsurance sector, and the consequences of such an event would be different than in the banking sector.</p>

To foster trust in the insurance and reinsurance single market and to foster a level playing field, a minimum degree of preparedness should be achieved through laying down a minimum market coverage level for the life insurance and reinsurance market and for the non-life insurance and reinsurance market. Regarding the scope of the resolution planning requirements, authorities should determine for which undertakings it is more likely relative to other undertakings under their remit that resolution action would be in the public interest in the event of failure or which undertakings carry out critical functions.</p>

Such indicators should help insurance and reinsurance undertakings to take remedial actions in the best interest of their policy holders in line with the undertakings’ risk management systems and should not lay down new regulatory prudential requirements. This Directive should, therefore, neither preclude undertakings from including in their pre-emptive recovery plans nor require undertakings to include in their pre-emptive recovery plans points of deterioration of the capital position that would precede non-compliance with the Solvency Capital Requirement laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, of Directive 2009/138/EC. Pre-emptive recovery plans covering all material legal entities within the group should be detailed and should be based on realistic assumptions that are applicable in a range of robust and severe scenarios. Those pre-emptive recovery plans should be an integral part of an undertaking’s system of governance. Existing tools may be taken into account when preparing such pre-emptive recovery plans, including the own risk and solvency assessment, contingency plans or liquidity risk management plans. The requirement to prepare a pre-emptive recovery plan should, however, be applied proportionately and should be without prejudice to the development and submission of a realistic recovery plan as required by Article 138(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC. Where relevant, the elements of the pre-emptive recovery plan could inform or serve as a basis to develop the recovery plan required by Article 138(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC.</p>

For the same reasons, each resolution authority responsible for a subsidiary undertaking should, for the subsidiary undertakings under its jurisdiction, draw up and keep updated a resolution plan.

In particular, the power of the resolution authorities to transfer the shares or all or part of the assets of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking to a private purchaser without the consent of shareholders affects the property rights of shareholders. In addition, the power to decide which liabilities to transfer out of a failing undertaking to ensure the continuity of services and to avoid adverse effects on policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties, the real economy or financial stability as a whole might affect the equal treatment of creditors. Any resolution tool should therefore be applied only to those insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are failing or likely to fail, and only where it is necessary and proportionate to pursue the resolution objectives in the general interest giving due consideration to the objective of protection of the collective interest of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants.

Insurance guarantee schemes applicable to an undertaking that meets the conditions for insolvency proceedings or resolution should be taken into account when determining if the application of resolution tools is necessary in the public interest. Any interference with the rights of shareholders and creditors that results from resolution action should be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). In particular, where creditors within the same class are treated differently in the context of resolution action, such distinctions should be justified in the public interest and be proportionate to the risks being addressed and should be neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of nationality.</p>

There could be extreme cases, however, where the resolution of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking requires the intervention of specific national schemes, in particular an insurance guarantee scheme or a resolution fund, to provide for complementary loss-absorbing and restructuring resources or, as a last resort, extraordinary public financing. The safeguards necessary to protect creditors should also reflect the existence of such specific national schemes, which in turn have to comply with the Union State aid framework.

That ‘no creditor worse off’ principle is a reflection of the fundamental right to property protected by Article 17 of the Charter. That right should be protected in the administrative resolution procedure by ensuring that any affected shareholder, policy holder, beneficiary, claimant or other creditor is not worse off than under normal insolvency proceedings. The valuation of the treatment that policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties would have received in such a case should include any payment that policy holders, beneficiaries and injured parties would have received from insurance guarantee schemes, where applicable, and from compensation bodies under Directive 2009/103/EC. In the event of a partial transfer of assets and liabilities of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking under resolution to a private purchaser or to a bridge undertaking, the residual part of the undertaking under resolution should be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings. Shareholders and creditors who are left in the winding-up proceedings of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking should be entitled to receive in payment of, or compensation for, their claims in the winding-up proceedings not less than what they would have recovered if the whole insurance or reinsurance undertaking had been wound up under normal insolvency proceedings.</p>

It is therefore necessary to lay down that, before any resolution action is taken, a fair and realistic valuation of the assets and liabilities of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is carried out. Such a valuation should be subject to a right of appeal. However, due to the nature of resolution action and its close link with the valuation, such appeal should only be possible where it is simultaneously directed against the resolution decision.

In cases where an undertaking is wound up under normal insolvency proceedings, a change of contract could entail replacement costs for policy holders. Especially for long term insurance contracts, market conditions and the policy holders’ own characteristics as well as additional costs such as brokerage and closing fees could lead to significant costs for policy holders having to replace their contracts. When estimating such replacement costs in the context of the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle, one has to assume that the conclusion of a new insurance contract with comparable cover available in the market against prevailing market rates takes place within a reasonable time from the date of resolution action.</p>

The valuation of assets and liabilities of failing insurance or reinsurance undertakings should be based on fair, prudent and realistic assumptions at the moment that resolution tools are applied. The value of liabilities should, however, not be affected in the valuation by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s financial state. Valuations for the purpose of informing the choice and the design of resolution actions should be consistent with the applicable prudential regulatory framework, but in the context of resolution targeted modifications to the principles underlying this framework could be made, in particular where the assumption that the undertaking will pursue its business as a going concern is not met. It should be possible, in exceptional cases of urgency, that resolution authorities make a rapid valuation of the assets or the liabilities of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. That valuation should be provisional and should apply until an independent valuation is carried out. EIOPA should establish a framework of principles to be used in conducting such valuations and should allow for different specific methodologies to be applied by resolution authorities and independent valuers, as appropriate.</p>

Financing arrangements should be available to satisfy claims of shareholders and other creditors under the ‘no creditor worse off’ principle if that is necessary to avoid reliance on public funds. Those claims should be calculated in accordance with the creditor hierarchy in normal insolvency proceedings in order to prevent shareholders or other creditors from being compensated before policy holders, beneficiaries or claimants are fully compensated. While directly absorbing the losses of an insurance company should be avoided, it should be possible to use such financing arrangements to finance other costs associated with the use of resolution tools as a last resort, to the extent necessary to achieve the resolution objectives and insofar as the resolution principles are fully respected. Member States should be able to decide that financing arrangements could be used to absorb losses of policy holders, beneficiaries and claimants. In such a case, the failing undertaking would exit the market and all or part of the portfolios of insurance contracts would be transferred as part of the sale-of-business tool or to a bridge undertaking, or maintained in the undertaking under resolution if it is placed in solvent run-off. In any case, shareholders should have been written down before resolution financing arrangements could be used to absorb losses. Acknowledging the diversity in insurance markets, Member States should be given some flexibility in relation to the precise arrangements of external financing as long as the availability of sufficient liquidity to guarantee compensation within a reasonable timeframe is ensured. A Member State should impose a contribution obligation only to insurance and reinsurance undertakings authorised in that Member State and to Union branches of a third-country undertaking which are established in its territory.</p>

Nevertheless, it is appropriate to exclude certain kinds of unsecured liabilities from the scope of application of the write-down or conversion tool.

To honour pension entitlements and pension amounts owed or owing to pension trusts and pension trustees, the write-down or conversion tool should not be applied to a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s liabilities to a pension scheme. To reduce the risk of systemic contagion, the write-down or conversion tool should neither be applied to liabilities arising from a participation in payment systems which have a remaining maturity of less than seven days, or to liabilities to insurance or reinsurance undertakings, credit institutions and investment firms, with the exception of entities that are part of the same group, with an original maturity of less than seven days.</p>

For that purpose, the point of non-viability should be understood as either the point at which the resolution authority concerned determines that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking meets the conditions for resolution, or the point at which the resolution authority concerned decides that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking would cease to be viable if those capital instruments were not written down or converted.

Such restrictions should allow resolution authorities to obtain a true picture of the balance sheet of the failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking without the changes in value and scope that an extensive exercise of termination rights would entail, and should help to avoid creating market instability. Interference with the contractual rights of counterparties should however be restricted to the minimum extent necessary. Any restrictions on termination rights imposed by resolution authorities should therefore only apply in relation to crisis management measures or events directly linked to the application of such measures.

It is therefore appropriate to lay down safeguards to prevent the splitting of linked liabilities or linked rights and contracts, including contracts with the same counterparty covered by security arrangements, title transfer financial collateral arrangements, set-off arrangements, close out netting agreements, and structured finance arrangements. Where such safeguards apply, resolution authorities should be bound to transfer all linked contracts within a protected arrangement, or leave them all with the residual failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Those safeguards should ensure that the regulatory capital treatment of exposures subject to a netting agreement for the purposes of Directive 2009/138/EC is not affected.</p>

Such a moratorium and the ensuing financial stability for the undertaking concerned should provide the resolution authorities with sufficient time to valuate those undertakings and to assess which resolution tools should be applied. Such a moratorium should also ensure equal treatment of policy holders, and thus avoid potential adverse financial impacts on policy holders that would not be among the first to surrender their policy. Because one of the objectives of resolution is the continuation of insurance cover, policy holders should continue to make any obligatory payments under the insurance or reinsurance contracts concerned, including in the case of annuities.</p>

Further action, however, is necessary to promote cooperation and prevent fragmented national responses. To agree to a group resolution scheme when resolving group entities, resolution authorities should therefore be required to consult each other and cooperate in resolution colleges. To provide for a forum for discussion and reaching such agreement, resolution colleges should be established around the core of the existing colleges of supervisors through the inclusion of resolution authorities and the involvement of competent ministries, EIOPA and, where appropriate, authorities responsible for the insurance guarantee schemes. Resolution colleges should not be decision-making bodies, but platforms facilitating decision-making by national authorities, while it should be for the national authorities concerned to take the joint decisions.</p>

That report should at least: assess the state of play of insurance guarantee schemes in Member States (coverage level, types of insurance covered, triggers); discuss policy options, including the different policy options, such as using insurance guarantee schemes to continue or to liquidate insurance policies, thereby taking due account of the differences in insurance products in various Member States; assess the necessity of introducing and, where appropriate, outline the steps necessary to introduce a minimum baseline for insurance guarantee schemes across the Union.
