The escalation of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine since February 2022 has led to unprecedented price increases. Those price increases are likely to fundamentally change the incentives to fill underground gas storage facilities in the Union. In the current geopolitical situation, further disruptions of gas supplies cannot be excluded. Such supply disruptions could severely harm citizens and the economy of the Union because the Union is still, to a significant extent, dependent on external gas supplies, which can be affected by the conflict.</p>

That response should prioritise measures that can reinforce the security of gas supply at Union level, in particular gas supplies to protected customers. Energy savings and energy efficiency are key contributors to that objective. It is therefore crucial that the Union acts in a coordinated manner to avoid potential risks resulting from possible gas supply disruptions, without prejudice to Member States’ right to choose between different energy sources and the general structure of their energy supply in accordance with Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p>

Some Member States that have significant underground storage capacity would be disproportionately affected by the obligation to meet the filling target for the underground gas storage facilities on their territory. In order to reflect that situation, the obligation to fill their underground gas storage facilities should be reduced to 35 % of their average annual gas consumption over the preceding five years. This should be without prejudice to the obligation of other Member States to contribute to the filling of the underground gas storage facilities concerned. Member States should be able to decide, subject to conditions, to partially meet the filling target by counting liquefied natural gas (LNG) stocks stored in LNG facilities. The filling targets are necessary to ensure that consumers in the Union are adequately protected against gas supply shortages. For 2022, a lower filling target of 80 % and a reduced number of intermediate targets should apply, taking into account the fact that this Regulation is to enter into force after the start of the storage filling season and that Member States will have limited time to implement it.</p>

In the event of such a substantial and sustained deviation from the filling trajectory or of a deviation from the filling target, the Commission should be empowered to take effective measures to avoid security of gas supply problems resulting from unfilled storage facilities. When deciding upon such effective measures, the Commission should take into account the specific situation of the Member State concerned, such as the size of the underground gas storage facilities in relation to domestic gas consumption, the importance of the underground gas storage facilities for security of gas supply in the region and any existing LNG storage facilities. As this Regulation is to enter into force after the start of the storage filling season in 2022, any measures taken by the Commission to address deviations from the filling trajectory for 2022 should take into account the limited time available for the implementation of this Regulation at national level. The Commission should ensure that the measures do not go beyond what is necessary to safeguard the security of gas supply, without putting a disproportionate burden on Member States, gas market participants, storage system operators or consumers.</p>

In so doing, they should aim to use market-based measures as a first recourse, where possible, so as to avoid unnecessary market disruption. Member States should be free to set a higher filling target, so that the Union could strive to reach collectively the filling of 85 % of the capacity of the underground gas storage facilities in the Union for 2022. Given the various regulatory regimes already in place in many Member States to support the filling of storage facilities, no specific instrument to meet the filling trajectories or the filling target should be imposed. Member States should remain free to decide which instrument is most appropriate for their national systems, provided that certain conditions are met. Member States or competent regulatory authorities should therefore have the possibility to determine which market participants are to be required to ensure the filling of the underground gas storage facilities. They should also be able to decide whether regulatory means, such as measures to oblige capacity holders to free up unused capacity, which are possible under existing Union market rules are sufficient to ensure that the filling targets are met, or whether financial incentives or storage tariff rebates are necessary. If a Member State imposes an obligation on suppliers of gas to protected customers on its territory to store gas in underground gas storage facilities, the amount of gas to be stored should be determined on the basis of the amount of natural gas supplied to those protected customers. Member States should coordinate with each other and use instruments such as platforms for the purchase of LNG in order to maximise the utilisation of LNG to fill storage facilities. In addition, Member States should reduce infrastructure and regulatory barriers to the shared use of LNG to fill storage facilities.</p>

For that purpose, the risk-based approach to assessing the security of gas supply and the establishment of preventive and mitigating measures should also take into account scenarios in which there is a total disruption of a single supply source. To ensure maximum preparedness in order to avoid a disruption of gas supply and to mitigate the effects of such a disruption, the common risk assessment and the national risk assessments should be carried out by taking into account such scenarios. This would enable the coordination of measures to mitigate the effects of an emergency and the optimisation of resources to guarantee a continued supply, in the event of a total disruption of supply.</p>

Member States should ensure that each storage system operator, including storage system operators that are controlled by transmission system operators, is certified by the national regulatory authority or by another competent authority designated by the Member State, in order to ensure that the security of energy supply or any other essential security interest in the Union or any Member State is not endangered by the influence over the storage system operator. For the analysis of possible security of energy supply risks, coordination between Member States in carrying out the security of supply assessment is important. That assessment should not discriminate between market participants but should fully comply with the principles of a well-functioning internal market. In order to quickly alleviate the risk resulting from low filling levels, that certification should be prioritised and carried out faster for larger underground storage facilities which have recently been filled at consistently low levels, so as to ensure that potential security of gas supply problems resulting from control over such large storage facilities can be excluded or, if possible, rectified. Considering the average filling level of the preceding six years of all Union underground storage facilities on 31 March being 35 % of their maximum capacity, the threshold for the definition of an unusually low filling level in March 2021 and March 2022 should be set at 30 %.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">National regulatory authorities or another competent authority designated by the Member States concerned (in either case, ‘certifying authority’) should refuse certification where they conclude that a person who directly or indirectly controls or exercises any right over the storage system operator could endanger the security of energy supply or any other essential security interest at national, regional or Union level. In making that assessment, the certifying authority should take into account commercial relationships that could negatively affect the incentives and ability of the storage system operator to fill the underground gas storage facility, as well as the international obligations of the Union and any other specific facts and circumstances of the case. To ensure the consistent application of certification rules across the Union, the observance of the international obligations of the Union and solidarity and energy security within the Union, the certifying authority should take the utmost account of the Commission’s opinion when it takes decisions on certification, including by revising its draft decision, where appropriate. Where a certifying authority refuses certification, it should have the power to require any person to dispose of the shareholding or rights they have over the storage system owner or storage system operator and to set a time limit for such disposal, to order any other appropriate measure to ensure that that person is not able to exercise any control or right over that storage system owner or storage system operator, and to decide on appropriate compensatory measures. Any measure taken in the certification decision to address security of gas supply risks or other essential security interests should be necessary, clearly defined, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory.</p>

They shall be based on an assessment of the general security of gas supply situation and the development of gas demand and supply in the Union and individual Member States, and set in a manner that safeguards the security of gas supply, while avoiding unnecessary burdens on Member States, gas market participants, storage system operators or customers and not unduly distorting competition between storage facilities located in neighbouring Member States.</p>
