In its communication of 9 March 2021 entitled ‘2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade’, the Commission underlined the need to speed up the digitalisation of public services by 2030, including by ensuring interoperability across all levels of administration and across public services. Moreover, Decision (EU) 2022/2481 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_202400903EN.000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_202400903EN.000101-E0004"

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic increased the speed of digitalisation, pushing public administrations to adapt to the online paradigm, including for cross-border digital public services, as well as for the smarter and greener use of technologies in accordance with the climate and energy targets set in the European Green Deal and in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc5-L_202400903EN.000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_202400903EN.000101-E0005"

This Regulation aims to significantly contribute to those Union objectives by creating a structured cooperation framework on cross-border interoperability among Member States and between the Commission and Member States to support the setup of digital public services, helping to reduce costs and save time for citizens, businesses and the public sector.</p>

A comprehensive and sustainable ecosystem of digital infrastructures, with adequate financial support, is equally important to achieving the objectives set out in Decision (EU) 2022/2481. In line with the communication of the Commission of 30 June 2021 entitled ‘A long-term Vision for the EU’s Rural Areas – Towards stronger, connected, resilient and prosperous rural areas by 2040’, particular attention should be paid to extending connectivity to rural and remote areas within the Union, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps such as islands, cross-border and mountain regions, ensuring that the benefits of digital transformation align with and support established Union initiatives for enhanced regional inclusivity and connectivity.</p>

As a catalyst for the development of organisational, semantic and technical interoperability, legal interoperability facilitates reaping the benefits of cross-border interoperability generally, including swift access for citizens and businesses to information, faster procedures and services and the reduction of administrative obstacles. Furthermore, as the language barrier is one of the obstacles to interoperability, to the reuse of solutions and to the establishment of cross border services, semantic interoperability is key to facilitating effective communication in diverse multi-linguistic environments, including at regional and local level.</p>

Trans-European digital public services should include, inter alia, the key public services as defined in Decision (EU) 2022/2481, covering essential services that are relevant for major life events for natural persons, such as finding a job or studies, and for legal persons in their professional life-cycle. Key public services with trans-European relevance are intended to give rise to major benefits for citizens where they become interoperable across borders. Examples of trans-European digital public services are services that, by means of cross-border exchanges of data, allow for the mutual recognition of academic diplomas or professional qualifications, exchanges of vehicle data for road safety, access to social security and health data, including pandemic and vaccination certificates, access to single window systems, the exchange of information related to taxation, customs, public tender accreditation, digital driving licenses or commercial registers, and in general all those services that implement the ‘once-only’ principle to access and exchange cross-border data.</p>

This entails the need for trust between public administrations, allowing for data exchange between local administrations in different Member States without necessarily going through national nodes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop common interoperability solutions that are reusable across all administrative levels. Interoperability solutions encompass different forms ranging from higher-level tools like conceptual frameworks and guidelines to more technical solutions such as reference architectures, technical specifications or standards. Moreover, concrete services and applications, as well as documented technical components such as source code, including artefacts and artificial intelligence models can be interoperability solutions, if they address legal, organisational, semantic, or technical aspects of cross-border interoperability. Needs for cross-border digital interactions are increasing, which requires solutions that can fulfil those needs. This Regulation intends to facilitate and encourage exchanges at all levels of administration, overcoming cross-border barriers and administrative burdens, thereby increasing the efficiency of public services across the Union.</p>

However, a single sector interoperability perspective is associated with the risk that the adoption of different or incompatible solutions at national or sectoral levels will give rise to new electronic barriers that impede the proper functioning of the internal market and the associated freedoms of movement. Furthermore, it risks undermining the openness and competitiveness of markets and the delivery of services of general interest to citizens and business. Therefore, this Regulation should also facilitate, encourage and apply to cross-sector interoperability, thereby supporting the removal of barriers, incompatibilities and the fragmentation of digital public services.</p>

In some circumstances, it can be reasonable and economical for the subject of an interoperability assessment to be broader than a single project, including where public sector bodies intend to establish a common application or processing platform. In such cases, the interoperability assessment should be strongly encouraged to go beyond the achievement of the Interoperable Europe objectives towards the full implementation of interoperability. Similarly, the requirements for interoperability assessments conducted at the level of single project implementation, such as in a local authority, should be pragmatic and allow for a narrow focus, taking into account the fact that the wider benefits of interoperability assessments are generally harvested at the early stages of policy design and the development of reference architecture, specifications and standards. Where the Board adopts guidelines on the content of the interoperability assessment, it should take into account, inter alia, the capacity of regional and local public sector bodies and avoid excessive administrative burden.</p>

A standardised output of reporting in a machine-readable format could be used for monitoring purposes. Such a tool should also facilitate automated translation and should be integrated in the Interoperable Europe portal. To foster interoperability and seamless integration, the online tool should also adopt and comply with an open data model derived from the common checklist for interoperability assessment reports. The provision of an application programming interface is crucial, allowing the integration of the tool into existing reporting platforms, thereby maximising utility and efficiency for all stakeholders. While the use of the online tool should be voluntary, by submitting the necessary data and by allowing for its publication on the Interoperable Europe portal, the obligation of a Union entity or a public sector body to publish a report presenting the outcome of the interoperability assessment in a public location should be considered to be fulfilled.</p>

Interoperability is a condition for avoiding technological lock-in, enabling technical developments, and fostering innovation, which should boost the global competitiveness, resilience and open strategic autonomy of the Union.</p>

That mechanism should focus on the interoperable digital implementation of policies once they have been adopted in the form of legal acts and should serve to develop interoperability solutions on a needs-driven basis. The mechanism should support public sector bodies. Policy implementation support projects to support public sector bodies should be proposed by the Board to the Commission who should decide whether to set up the support projects, with due regard to the potential need for non- authoritative, machine-executable versions of the policy, such as reference implementation models or code, reusable at all levels of administration.</p>

To ensure a legal framework that is innovation-friendly, future-proof and resilient to disruption, it should be made possible to run such projects in interoperability regulatory sandboxes. Interoperability regulatory sandboxes should consist of controlled test environments that facilitate the development and testing of innovative solutions before such solutions are integrated in the network and information systems of the public sector. The establishment of interoperability regulatory sandboxes should aim to foster interoperability through innovative solutions by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment with a view to ensuring the alignment of those solutions with this Regulation and other relevant Union and national law, to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities and to increase the understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impact of the new solutions. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and to achieve economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the implementation of the interoperability regulatory sandboxes. The European Data Protection Supervisor has the power to impose administrative fines on Union entities in the context of interoperability regulatory sandboxes, in accordance with Article 58(2), point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>

The evaluation should be based on the following five criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and value added, with a specific focus on the impact of this Regulation on the cross-border interoperability of trans-European digital public services as an enabler for seamless and accessible digital public services, the reduction of administrative burdens and the need for any additional measures and policies at Union level. The evaluation should also be the basis for impact assessments for possible further measures. Furthermore, the Commission should, after consulting the Board, prepare the methodology, process, and indicators for monitoring. The monitoring mechanism should be designed to minimise the administrative burden on Member States by reusing, to the extent feasible, existing data sources and by creating synergies with existing monitoring mechanisms, such as the Digital Economy and Society Index, the eGovernment Benchmark and the trajectories of the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 established by Decision (EU) 2022/2481.</p>
