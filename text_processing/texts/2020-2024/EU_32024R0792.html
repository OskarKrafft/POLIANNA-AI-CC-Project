The Facility should therefore promote reconstruction in a way that modernises and improves Ukraine’s economy, building on Union rules and standards, investing in the transition of Ukraine towards a sustainable green, digital and inclusive economy, thereby benefitting society as a whole, with particular attention to the needs of vulnerable groups. Reconstruction of cultural heritage should be based on national, international and European practices, on standard-setting texts, principles, such as New European Bauhaus, and lessons learned, and be consistent with the European quality principles for Union-funded interventions which have a potential impact on cultural heritage. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring the sustainability of and adequate protection for activities financed under the Facility in light of cybersecurity risks and the overall threat landscape.</p>

It is also appropriate to derogate from Article 220(5), point (e), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and to allow the Union the possibility to cover, for the period from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2027, the interest rate costs (cost of funding and cost of liquidity management) and to waive the administrative costs (cost of service for administrative overheads) that would otherwise be borne by Ukraine.
