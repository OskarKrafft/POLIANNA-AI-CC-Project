They also have the potential to accelerate the advancement of knowledge by making it more reliable, efficient and accurate, more easily understood by society and responsive to societal challenges. Provisions should be laid down to ensure that beneficiaries provide open access to peer-reviewed scientific publications. Likewise, it should be ensured that beneficiaries provide open access to research data following the principle 'as open as possible, as closed as necessary', while ensuring the possibility of exceptions taking into account the legitimate interests of the beneficiaries. More emphasis should in particular be given to the responsible management of research data, which should comply with the principles of 'findability', 'accessibility', 'interoperability' and 'reusability' (the 'FAIR principles'), in particular through the mainstreaming of data management plans. Where appropriate, beneficiaries should make use of the possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the European Data Infrastructure and adhere to further open science principles and practices. Reciprocity in open science should be encouraged in all association and cooperation agreements with third countries.</p>

Those recommendations include the proposal of measures to promote brain circulation and facilitate openness of R&amp;I networks to invest more ambitiously in order to reach critical mass and maximise impact; to support breakthrough innovation; to prioritise Union R&amp;I investments in areas of high added value, in particular through mission-orientation, full, well-informed and timely citizen involvement and wide communication; to rationalise the Union funding landscape in order to fully use the R&amp;I potential, including research infrastructures across the Union, such as by streamlining the range of European Partnership initiatives and co-funding schemes; to develop more and concrete synergies between different Union funding instruments, in particular by overcoming non-complementary intervention logics and complexity of the various funding and other regulations also with the aim of helping to mobilise under-exploited R&amp;I potential across the Union; to strengthen international cooperation and reinforce openness to third countries' participation; and to continue simplification based on implementation experiences of Horizon 2020.</p>

With a view to avoiding duplication or overlaps, to increasing the leverage of Union funding and to decreasing the administrative burden for applicants and beneficiaries, it should be possible to promote synergies, in particular by alternative, combined, cumulative funding and transfers of resources.</p>

Support schemes provided by the EIT should benefit EIC beneficiaries, while start-ups emerging from the EIT's KICs should have simplified and thereby faster access to EIC actions. While the EIT's focus on innovation ecosystems should make it naturally fit within the pillar 'Innovative Europe', it should also support the other pillars, as appropriate.

                        <p class="oj-normal">As the report of the High Level Group on maximising the impact of Union R&amp;I (the Lamy High Level Group) clearly states, the way forward is 'to educate for the future and invest in people who will make the change'. In particular, European higher education institutions are called to stimulate entrepreneurship, tear down disciplinary borders and institutionalise strong inter-disciplinary academia-industry collaborations. According to recent surveys, access to talented people is by far the most important factor influencing the location choices of European founders of start-ups. Entrepreneurship education, training opportunities and the development of creative skills play a key role in cultivating future innovators and in developing the abilities of existing ones to grow their business to greater levels of success. Access to entrepreneurial talent, together with access to professional services, capital and markets on the Union level, and bringing key innovation actors together around a common goal are key ingredients for nurturing an innovation ecosystem. There is a need to coordinate efforts across the Union in order to create a critical mass of interconnected Union-wide entrepreneurial clusters and ecosystems.</p>
                        <p class="oj-normal">The EIT is today's Europe's largest integrated innovation ecosystem which brings together partners from business, research, education and beyond. The EIT continues to support its KICs, which are large-scale European Partnerships addressing specific global challenges, and strengthen the innovation ecosystems around them. It does so by fostering the integration of education, R&amp;I of the highest standards, thereby creating environments conducive to innovation, and by promoting and supporting a new generation of entrepreneurs and stimulating the creation of innovative companies in close synergy and complementarity with the EIC.</p>
                        <p class="oj-normal">Throughout Europe, efforts are still needed to develop ecosystems where researchers, innovators, industries and governments can easily interact. Innovation ecosystems, in fact, still do not work optimally due to a number of reasons such as:</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Impact pathways, and related key impact pathway indicators, shall structure the monitoring of the Programme's progress towards its objectives as referred to in Article 3. The impact pathways shall be time-sensitive and reflect three complementary impact categories reflecting the non-linear nature of R&amp;I investments: scientific, societal and technological or economic. For each of those impact categories, proxy indicators are used to track progress distinguishing between the short, medium and longer terms, including beyond the Programme's duration, with possibilities for breakdowns, including by Member States and associated countries. Those indicators shall be compiled using quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Individual Programme parts contribute to those indicators to a different degree and through different mechanisms. Additional indicators can be used to monitor individual Programme parts, where relevant.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The micro-data behind the key impact pathway indicators are collected for all parts of the Programme and for all delivery mechanisms in a centrally managed and harmonised way and at the appropriate level of granularity with minimal reporting burden on the beneficiaries.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In addition and beyond key impact pathways indicators, data on the optimised delivery of the Programme for strengthening the ERA, fostering the excellence-based participations from all Member States in the Programme as well as facilitating collaborative links in European R&amp;I are collected and reported in close to real-time as part of implementation and management data, referred to in Article 50. This includes the monitoring of collaborative links, of network analytics, of data on proposals, applications, participations, projects, applicants and participants (including data on the type of organisation, such as civil society organisations, SMEs and private sector), country (such as a specific classification for country groups such as Member States, associated countries and third countries), gender, role in project, scientific discipline or sector, including SSH), and the monitoring of the level of climate mainstreaming and related expenditures.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Scientific impact pathway indicators</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Programme is expected to have scientific impact by creating high-quality new knowledge, strengthening human capital in R&amp;I, and fostering diffusion of knowledge and open science. Progress towards this impact is monitored through proxy indicators set along the following three key impact pathways.</p>
