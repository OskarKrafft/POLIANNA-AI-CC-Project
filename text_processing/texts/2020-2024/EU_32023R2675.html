That Declaration also provides, in relation to the principle concerning the duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind, which reflects customary international law and is thus binding in the relations between third countries, on the one part, and the Union and its Member States, on the other. Moreover, rules of customary international law on State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts are reflected in the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), adopted in 2001 by the United Nations’ International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, and taken note of by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 56/83.

This is particularly the case where third countries interfere in the legitimate sovereign choices of the Union or a Member State by applying or threatening to apply measures affecting trade or investment in order to prevent or obtain the cessation, modification or adoption of a particular act by the Union or a Member State, including an expression of a position by an institution, body, office or agency of the Union or a Member State. Such measures affecting trade or investment include not only actions taken on, and having effects within, the territory of the third country concerned, but also actions taken by the third country, including through entities controlled or directed by the third country and that are present in the Union, that cause harm to economic activities in the Union. The term ‘third country’ should be understood to include not only a third State, but also a separate customs territory or other subject of international law because such entities are also capable of economic coercion. The use of that term and the application of this Regulation do not have any implication regarding sovereignty. Moreover, this Regulation should be applied in conformity with the Union’s position in relation to the third country concerned.</p>

Given the exclusive competence conferred on the Union by Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), only the Union is permitted to act. Moreover, it is possible that Member States, as distinct actors under international law, are not entitled to counteract economic coercion of the Union by third countries. Therefore, it is necessary that the means for effectively achieving those objectives are created at Union level. This Regulation is without prejudice to the division of competences between the Union and its Member States.</p>

The Union response measures should be preceded by an examination of the facts, a determination of the existence of economic coercion, and, wherever possible and provided that the third country also engages in good faith, efforts to find a solution in cooperation with the third country concerned. Any measures imposed by the Union should be proportionate and not exceed the injury to the Union. The criteria for selecting and designing the Union response measures should take into account, in particular, the effectiveness of the Union response measures in inducing the cessation of the economic coercion and, where requested, reparation of the injury to the Union, and the need to avoid or minimise collateral effects, disproportionate administrative complexity and burdens and costs imposed, in particular, on Union economic operators, as well as the Union interest. Therefore, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with Article 5(4) TEU.</p>

Accordingly, Union response measures could consist, as necessary, not only in measures consistent with the Union’s international obligations, but also in the non-performance of international obligations towards the third country concerned insofar as the economic coercion by the third country constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Under international law, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, countermeasures are to be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question. In that respect, injury to the Union or a Member State is understood under international law to include injury to Union economic operators.</p>

The Commission and the Council should take into account qualitative and quantitative criteria that help in determining whether the third country interferes in the legitimate sovereign choices of the Union or a Member State and whether its action constitutes economic coercion which requires a Union response. Among those criteria, there should be elements that characterise, both qualitatively and quantitatively, notably the form, the effects and the aim of the measures which the third country is deploying. Applying those criteria would ensure that only economic coercion with a sufficiently serious impact or, where the economic coercion consists in a threat, that only a credible threat, falls under this Regulation. In addition, the Commission and the Council should examine closely whether the third country pursues a legitimate cause, because its objective is to uphold a concern that is internationally recognised, such as, among other things, the maintenance of international peace and security, the protection of human rights, the protection of the environment, or the fight against climate change.</p>
