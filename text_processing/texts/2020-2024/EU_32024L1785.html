In addition, the Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Circular Economy Action Plan and the Farm to Fork Strategy also call for the improvement of resource efficiency and reuse while reducing pollutant emissions at source, including sources not currently within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU. Addressing pollution from certain agro-industrial activities, while promoting sustainable agricultural practices that have multiple co-benefits for the environmental and climate objectives of the European Green Deal, requires their inclusion within the scope of that Directive.</p>

Metals are of strategic importance for the digital and green transition, the energy, materials and circular economy transformation as well as for the strengthening of the Union’s economic resilience and autonomy. In order to achieve those objectives, sustainable domestic capacities and supply need to be further developed, especially in light of the growing global demand, the vulnerability of supply chains and geopolitical tensions. This requires effective, tailored and harmonised measures to ensure that the best available techniques are established and employed, thus applying processes that are both the most efficient and have the lowest possible impacts on human health and the environment. The governance mechanisms of Directive 2010/75/EU, which closely associate industry experts with the development of consensual and tailored environmental requirements, will support the sustainable growth of those activities in the Union. The development and availability of commonly agreed standards will level the Union’s playing field while ensuring a high level of protection of human health and the environment. It is therefore appropriate to include those activities within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU, without prejudice to the Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_202401785EN.000101-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_202401785EN.000101-E0007"

The Industrial Emissions Directive will help in meeting the targets for the streamlined permit granting process of the Critical Raw Materials Act by supporting Member States as regards the setting of operating permit conditions and the rapid granting of permits.</p>

To reduce those emissions, including ammonia, methane, nitrates and greenhouse gas and thereby improve air, water and soil quality, it is necessary to lower the threshold above which pig and poultry installations are included within the scope of Directive 2010/75/EU. Therefore, the Commission should assess, and report to the European Parliament and the Council on the need for Union action to comprehensively address the emissions from the rearing of livestock, in particular cattle, taking into account the range of instruments available and the specificities of the sector. In parallel, the Commission should also assess and report to the European Parliament and the Council, based on evidence, on the need for Union action to achieve the objective of global environmental protection with regard to products placed on the internal market through the prevention and control of emissions from livestock farming, in a manner consistent with the international obligations of the Union.</p>

The environmental performance levels associated with BAT and the benchmarks could include consumption levels, resource efficiency levels and reuse levels covering materials, water and energy resources, and waste and other levels obtained under specified reference conditions. Environmental performance levels and benchmarks should be established taking account of the resources needed for the transformation of installations that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as demand-driven variations of resource needs for specific products, such as variations of water consumption. The competent authority should set in the permit, binding ranges for environmental performance as laid down in BAT conclusions, as well as binding environmental performance limit values concerning water and indicative environmental performance levels concerning waste and resources other than water, which are not environmentally less strict than the binding ranges, provided that the lower performing end of the mandatory range is ensured.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Providing a high level of protection of human health and the environment as a whole requires, inter alia, the establishment in permits of emission limit values at a level that ensures compliance with the applicable emission levels associated with the best available techniques set out in the BAT conclusions. Emission levels associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AELs) are usually expressed as ranges, rather than as single values, to reflect the differences within a given type of installation that result in variations in the environmental performances achieved when applying BAT. For example, a given BAT will not deliver the same performance for different installations, some BATs might not be suitable for use in certain installations, or a combination of BATs could be more effective for some pollutants or environmental media than others. The achievement of a high level of protection of human health and the environment as a whole has been jeopardised by the practice of setting emission limit values at the laxest end of the range of emission levels associated with the best available techniques, without considering the potential of a given installation to achieve lower emission levels through the application of best available techniques. Such practice discourages frontrunners from implementing more effective techniques, and hinders the achievement of a level playing field which ensures a high level of protection of human health and the environment. In order for the emissions to be decreased, the competent authority should set emission limit values at the strictest achievable level for the specific installation, taking into account the entire range of the BAT AELs as well as cross-media effects. The emission limit values should be based on an assessment by the operator analysing the feasibility of meeting the strictest end of the BAT AEL range and aiming at the best environmental performance possible for the specific installations; unless the operator demonstrates that applying best available techniques as described in the BAT conclusions only allows the installation concerned to meet less strict emission limit values. In order to support the setting of emission limit values in permits and the adoption of general binding rules, BAT conclusions should contain information on the circumstances allowing the achievement of lower emissions levels within the range of BAT-AELs set for categories of installations having similar characteristics. When setting emission limit values within the range of the BAT AELs, the derogation procedure should not be applicable.</p>

Those crises have suddenly and directly affected the supply of energy and of societally-critical resources, materials or equipment, leading to severe shortages and disruption to which it is necessary to react swiftly. Where crises require such reaction, it could be necessary to set emission limit values and environmental performance limit values that are less strict than the levels in the BAT conclusions, in order to maintain energy production or the production of other equipment of critical importance or to allow the continuity of the operations of critical installations. The need to set less strict emission limit values or environmental performance limit values is to be balanced with the need to protect the environment and human health as well as to ensure the level playing field and the integrity of the internal market. Consequently, less strict limits may be set only as a last resort, when all measures resulting in less pollution have been exhausted. The competent authority should ensure that no significant pollution is caused due to emissions from the installation. In order to supervise the impact on the environment and public health, the emissions should be monitored. In order to ensure there is a level playing field and protect the internal market, the Commission should be able to provide strict guidance regarding the exceptional crisis situations and their circumstances that could be taken into account. The Commission should verify that such derogations granted by the Member States are justified and formulate objections where it concludes that a derogation is not justified, in which case the Member State should revise the derogation without delay.</p>

Without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology, it is therefore appropriate to facilitate the testing and deployment of emerging techniques with improved environmental performance, to facilitate cooperation with researchers and industries in publicly funded research projects subject to the conditions provided for in the relevant European and national funding instruments, as well as to set up a dedicated centre to support innovation by collecting and analysing information on emerging techniques, relevant to activities within the scope of that Directive, including the rearing of poultry and pigs, and to characterise their level of development from research to deployment using the technology readiness level (‘TRL’) scale and assess the level of the environmental performance of those techniques, while taking into account any potential limitation with regard to the availability of data and its robustness. This will also inform the exchange of information on drawing up, reviewing and updating BAT reference documents. Emerging techniques to be analysed by the centre should be at least at the level of TRL 6-7, namely technology demonstrated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies) or system prototype demonstration in operation environment.</p>

The first priority should be the transformation of energy-intensive activities listed in Annex I. Therefore, the operators of energy-intensive installations should produce transformation plans by 30 June 2030. Operators of installations carrying out other activities listed in Annex I should be required to produce transformation plans as part of the permit reconsideration and update following the publication of decisions on BAT conclusions published after 1 January 2030. Operators should be allowed to produce a single transformation plan covering all installations under their control in a Member State and, where elements of the transformation plans have already been developed in other documents and are compliant with the requirements of Directive 2010/75/EU, operators should be allowed to include in the transformation plan a reference to the relevant documents. Whilst the transformation plans should remain indicative documents prepared under the responsibility of the operators, the conformity assessment body or the environmental verifier contracted by the operators as part of their environmental management systems should check that they contain the minimum information required pursuant to a delegated act to be adopted by the Commission, and the operators should make the transformation plans public.</p>

The Member States concerned should establish a plan for compliance covering combustion plants being part of a small isolated system that sets out the measures to ensure compliance with the emission limit values at the latest by 31 December 2029. The plan should describe the measures to ensure compliance with this Directive, and measures to minimise the magnitude and duration of the pollutant emissions during the period covered by the plan and include information on demand management measures and possibilities for cleaner fuel switching possibilities or cleaner alternatives such as the deployment of renewables and interconnection with the mainland grids or the grid of another Member State. Member States concerned should communicate their Compliance Plan to the Commission. Member States should update the plan in case the Commission raises objections. Member States concerned should report annually on progress towards compliance.</p>

To ensure legal certainty there is a need to have a fixed date by when the provisions should be complied with at the absolute latest. With regard to the Seville process and the number of BAT reference documents that need to be reviewed, this date should be set to 12 years for existing activities and 10 years for new activities. This does not prevent BAT conclusions to be adopted and implemented earlier, which is expected for most activities covered by this directive. Existing installations should comply with the provisions in Directive 2010/75/EU in the version in force on 3 August 2024, until there are new BAT conclusions or there is a permit update.</p>
