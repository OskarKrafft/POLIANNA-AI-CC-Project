While facing a continuous inflow of persons fleeing Russian aggression, many Member States are also affected by shortages of labour, supply chain difficulties and rising prices and energy costs. On the one hand, this generates challenges for public budgets and, on the other, delays the implementation of investments. Such circumstances have created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed with specific, well-targeted measures, in order not to require changes in the multiannual financial framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments set out in Annex I to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 <a id="ntc2-L_2022275EN.01002301-E0002" href="#ntr2-L_2022275EN.01002301-E0002"

In addition, it is appropriate to extend the simplified monitoring requirements set out in Article 98(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to operations supported by the ESF which address migratory challenges, where these operations are programmed in a priority axis which only addresses those challenges. Furthermore, the possibility should be introduced that priorities promoting the socioeconomic integration of third country nationals, including those dedicated to operations addressing migratory challenges resulting from the Russian aggression, benefit from a co-financing rate of up to 100 % in both programming periods, in order to support Member States in addressing displaced persons both now and in the future. In the same vein, the amount for the unit cost to facilitate the financing of basic needs and the support of refugees should be increased and its application in time extended.</p>

It is therefore appropriate to exceptionally allow for the selection of such operations prior to the approval of a related programme amendment and for the eligibility of expenditure for such operations which are physically completed or fully implemented, also extending these flexibilities to operations supported by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) which address the consequences on the fishery and aquaculture sector resulting from the Russian aggression. Furthermore, taking into account the limited funding available in the regions most affected, it should be possible to support such operations beyond the limits of the programme area within a given Member State, given that the situation of persons fleeing Russian aggression and moving within and across Member States poses a challenge to the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union as a whole. Such operations should therefore be eligible irrespective of where they are implemented within a given Member State, as their location is ultimately not a decisive criterion when addressing the immediate needs.</p>

Again with a view to alleviating the burden on national budgets, pre-financing payments for programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal should be increased. Furthermore, given the challenges posed by the displacement of people and the integrated responses required from Member States, where a Member State dedicates a priority under one of its 2021–2027 cohesion programmes to supporting operations that promote the socioeconomic integration of third country nationals, a co-financing rate of up to 100 % for that priority should be possible until 30 June 2024, provided that an appropriate level of support is directed to local authorities and civil society organisations operating in local communities and that the total amount programmed under such priorities in a Member State does not exceed 5 % of the initial national allocation of that Member State from the ERDF and the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) combined. This is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to programme additional amounts for such priorities with regular co-financing rates. Also, taking into account disruptions to the end of the 2014–2020 programming period caused by the military aggression by the Russian Federation, on top of the long-lasting consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on project implementation and continuing disruptions of value chains, additional flexibility should also be provided to enable the direct granting of support and completion of operations for which implementation had started in accordance with the 2014–2020 legislative framework before the date of the legislative proposal for this Regulation, even where such operations would not fall within the scope of the Fund concerned under the 2021–2027 programming period, with the exception of cases where the Funds were used under Article 98(4), first and second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. To ensure that such operations can be attributed to types of interventions, Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_2022275EN.01002301-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2022275EN.01002301-E0007"
