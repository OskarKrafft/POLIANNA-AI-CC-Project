In that report, the Court of Justice took the view that there was no need, at that time, to propose changes as regards the manner of dealing with requests for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU. Nevertheless, in that same report, it pointed out that a subsequent transfer of jurisdiction to the General Court to give preliminary rulings in certain specific areas could not be ruled out if the number and complexity of requests for a preliminary ruling submitted to the Court of Justice were to be such that the proper administration of justice required it. Furthermore, such a transfer is in line with the intentions of the authors of the Treaty of Nice, who sought to strengthen the efficiency of the judicial system of the Union by providing for the possibility of the General Court being involved in dealing with those requests.</p>

As requests for a preliminary ruling have to be dealt with expeditiously in order to enable national courts to guarantee the right to an effective remedy, the current situation should be addressed. That situation is attributable not only to the high number of requests for a preliminary ruling of which the Court of Justice is seised each year, but also to the great complexity and particularly sensitive nature of a growing number of questions put to that court. In order to allow the Court of Justice to continue to fulfil its mission of safeguarding and strengthening the unity and consistency of Union law, and to ensure that the decisions of the Court of Justice are of the highest quality, it is necessary, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, to make use of the possibility provided for in Article 256(3), first subparagraph, TFEU and to transfer to the General Court jurisdiction to hear and determine questions referred for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU, in specific areas laid down by the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘the Statute’).</p>
