In addition, some Member States have established a road circulation speed limit for non-road mobile machinery of 40 km/h.

This Regulation should therefore not apply to mobile machinery with a maximum design speed not exceeding 6 km/h or exceeding 40 km/h.</p>

In order to ensure a high level of harmonisation for non-road mobile machinery across the Union, it is important that Member States only prohibit the circulation on public roads of a limited number of machines.

The technical requirements should take into account synergies between the machinery function and the on-road use function of the non-road mobile machinery.

It also leads to more efficient use of scarce resources at national level. For this purpose, an advisory forum for exchange of information on enforcement should be established for Member States and the Commission with the objective of promoting best practices, exchanging information and coordinating activities related to the enforcement of this Regulation. Given the establishment of such a forum and considering its tasks, it should not be necessary to establish a separate administrative cooperation group as required by Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. However, the forum should be considered as an administrative cooperation group for the purposes of the Union Product Compliance Network referred to in Article 29 of that Regulation.</p>
