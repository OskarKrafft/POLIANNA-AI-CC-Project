Article 46
Validity of national individual vehicle approvals
1.   The validity of a national individual vehicle approval shall be restricted to the territory of the Member State that granted the individual vehicle approval.
2.   At the request of an applicant who wishes to make available on the market, register or enter into service in another Member State a vehicle with a national individual vehicle approval, the Member State that granted the approval shall provide the applicant with a statement of the technical requirements on the basis of which the vehicle has been approved.
3.   A Member State shall permit a vehicle for which another Member State has granted a national individual vehicle approval in accordance with Article 45 to be made available on the market, be registered or enter into service in its territory, unless that Member State has reasonable grounds to believe that the relevant alternative requirements on the basis of which the vehicle has been approved are not equivalent to its own or that the vehicle does not comply with those requirements.
4.   This Article applies to vehicles that have been type-approved in accordance with this Regulation and that have been modified before their first registration or entry into service.
