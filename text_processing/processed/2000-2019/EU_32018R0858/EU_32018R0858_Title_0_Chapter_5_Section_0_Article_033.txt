Article 33
General provisions on amendments of EU type-approvals
1.   The manufacturer shall inform the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval without delay of any change in the particulars recorded in the information package referred to in Article 26(4), including any change in the extended documentation package under the regulatory acts listed in Annex II.
The approval authority shall decide whether that change requires an amendment, in the form of either a revision or an extension of the EU type-approval in accordance with Article 34, or whether that change requires a new EU type-approval.
2.   An application for an amendment shall only be submitted to the approval authority that granted the existing EU type-approval.
3.   Where an approval authority finds that an amendment requires the repetition of inspections or tests, it shall inform the manufacturer accordingly.
4.   Where an approval authority finds on the basis of the inspections or tests referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article that the requirements for the EU type-approval continue to be fulfilled, the procedures referred to in Article 34 shall apply.
5.   Where the approval authority finds that the changes in the particulars recorded in the information package cannot be covered by an extension of the existing type-approval, it shall refuse to amend the EU type-approval and shall request the manufacturer to apply for a new EU type-approval.
