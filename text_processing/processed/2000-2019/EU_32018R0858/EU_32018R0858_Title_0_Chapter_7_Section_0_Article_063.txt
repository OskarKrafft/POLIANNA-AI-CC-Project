Article 63
Fees for access to vehicle repair and maintenance information
1.   The manufacturer may charge reasonable and proportionate fees for access to vehicle repair and maintenance information other than the records referred to in Article 61(10). Those fees shall not discourage access to such information by failing to take into account the extent to which the independent operator uses it. Access to vehicle repair and maintenance information shall be offered free of charge to national authorities, the Commission and technical services.
2.   The manufacturer shall make available vehicle repair and maintenance information, including transactional services such as reprogramming or technical assistance, on an hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly basis, with fees for access to such information varying in accordance with the respective periods of time for which access is granted.
In addition to time-based access, manufacturers may offer transaction-based access for which fees are charged per transaction and not based on the duration for which access is granted.
Where the manufacturer offers both systems of access, independent repairers shall choose systems of access, which may be either time-based or transaction-based.
