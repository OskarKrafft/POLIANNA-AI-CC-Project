Article 29
Specific provisions concerning EU type-approvals for systems, components and separate technical units
1.   An EU type-approval shall be granted in respect of a system, component or separate technical unit that conforms to the particulars in the information folder referred to in Article 24 and that meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex II.
2.   Where components or separate technical units, whether or not intended for repair, servicing or maintenance, are also covered by a system type-approval with respect to a vehicle, no additional component or separate technical unit type-approval shall be required unless such type-approval is provided for under the relevant regulatory acts listed in Annex II.
3.   Where a component or separate technical unit fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle, thereby making it possible to verify compliance only where the component or separate technical unit operates in conjunction with those other vehicle parts, the scope of the EU type-approval of the component or the separate technical unit shall be restricted accordingly.
In such cases, the EU type-approval certificate shall specify any restrictions on the use of the component or the separate technical unit, and shall indicate the special conditions for fitting that component or separate technical unit in a vehicle.
Where that component or separate technical unit is fitted in a vehicle, the approval authority shall verify, at the time of the approval of the vehicle, that the component or separate technical unit complies with all applicable restrictions on the use or conditions for fitting.
