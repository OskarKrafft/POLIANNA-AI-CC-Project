Article 7
Obligations of approval authorities
1.   Approval authorities shall only approve vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units that comply with this Regulation.
2.   Approval authorities shall carry out their duties independently and impartially. They shall observe confidentiality in order to protect commercial secrets, subject to the obligation laid down in Article 9(4) to make information available to the Commission and to other applicable disclosure requirements laid down in Union law in order to protect the interests of users in the Union.
Approval authorities shall cooperate efficiently and effectively, and shall share information relevant to their role and functions.
3.   For the purpose of enabling market surveillance authorities to carry out checks, approval authorities shall make available to market surveillance authorities the necessary information related to the type-approval of the vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units that are subject to compliance verification checks. That information shall include at least the information included in the EU type-approval certificate and its attachments referred to in Article 28(1). Approval authorities shall provide that information to the market surveillance authorities without undue delay.
4.   Where an approval authority has been informed in accordance with Chapter XI that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit is suspected of presenting a serious risk or of being in non-compliance, it shall take all necessary measures to review the type-approval granted and, where appropriate, correct or withdraw the type-approval depending on the reasons and the seriousness of the deviations demonstrated.
