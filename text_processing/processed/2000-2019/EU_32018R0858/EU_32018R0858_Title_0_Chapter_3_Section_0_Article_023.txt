Article 23
Application for EU type-approval
1.   The manufacturer shall submit to the approval authority an application for EU type-approval and the information folder referred to in Article 24.
2.   Only one application shall be submitted in respect of a particular type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit. That single application shall be submitted in only one Member State and to only one approval authority therein.
A new application may not be submitted in another Member State in respect of the same type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit where:
(a)
an approval authority has refused to grant a type-approval of that type;
(b)
an approval authority has withdrawn type-approval of that type; or
(c)
the manufacturer has revoked an application for a type-approval of that type.
The approval authority shall reject an application for a type-approval of a different type designation or of a modification with respect to a previous application where the changes are not sufficient to constitute a new type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit.
3.   An application for an EU type-approval of a particular type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit shall include a declaration by the manufacturer certifying, in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 that:
(a)
the manufacturer has not applied for an EU type-approval for the same type to any other approval authority, and no other approval authority granted the manufacturer such an approval;
(b)
no approval authority has refused to grant type-approval of that type;
(c)
no approval authority has withdrawn type-approval of that type; and
(d)
the manufacturer has not revoked an application for a type-approval of that type.
4.   A separate application shall be submitted for each type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit to be approved.
