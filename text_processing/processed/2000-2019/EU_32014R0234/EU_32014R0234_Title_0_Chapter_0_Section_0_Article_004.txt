Article 4
Programming and indicative allocation of funds
1.   Multi-annual indicative programmes (MIPs) shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014.
2.   MIPs shall set out the Union's strategic and/or mutual interests and priorities, the specific objectives and expected results. For countries or regions for which a joint framework document, laying down a comprehensive Union strategy, has been established, the MIPs shall be based on that document.
3.   MIPs shall also set out the priority areas selected for financing by the Union and shall outline the indicative allocation of funds, in overall terms, per priority area and per partner country or group of partner countries, for the period concerned, including the participation in global initiatives. Those amounts may, where appropriate, be expressed in the form of a range.
4.   MIPs may provide for an amount of funds, not exceeding 5 % of the total amount, that is not allocated to a priority area or partner country or group of countries. Those funds shall be committed in accordance with Article 2(2), (3) and (5) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014.
5.   The procedure referred to in Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 may be applied for the purpose of modifying MIPs on duly justified imperative grounds of urgency.
6.   With regard to attaining the objectives set out in Article 1, the Commission may take into account the geographic proximity of the Union's outermost regions and overseas countries and territories in the Union's cooperation with third countries.
7.   Any programming or review of programmes taking place after the publication of the mid-term review report referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 (the ‘mid-term review report’) shall take into account the results, findings and conclusions of that report.
