In accordance with the programmes mentioned in paragraph 1, Member States shall continue to comply with the emission ceilings and with the corresponding percentage reductions laid down for sulphur dioxide in Annex I, columns 1 to 6, and for oxides of nitrogen in Annex II, columns 1 to 4, by the dates specified in those Annexes, until the implementation of the provisions of Article 4 that apply to existing plants.
3. When the programmes are being carried out, Member States shall also determine the total annual emissions in accordance with Annex VIII(C).
4. 4. If a substantial and unexpected change in energy demand or in the availability of certain fuels or certain generating installations creates serious technical difficulties for the implementation by a Member State of its programme drawn up under paragraph 1, the Commission shall, at the request of the Member State concerned and taking into account the terms of the request, take a decision to modify, for that Member State, the emission ceilings and/or the dates set out in Annexes I and II and communicate its decision to the Council and to the Member States. Any Member State may within three months refer the decision of the Commission to the Council. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may within three months take a different decision.
