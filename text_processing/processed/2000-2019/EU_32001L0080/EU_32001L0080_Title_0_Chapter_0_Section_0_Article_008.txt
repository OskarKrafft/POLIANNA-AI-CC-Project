Article 8
1. In the case of plants with a multi-firing unit involving the simultaneous use of two or more fuels, when granting the licence referred to in Articles 4(1) or 4(2), and in the case of such plants covered by Articles 4(3) or 10, the competent authority shall set the emission limit values as follows:
(a) firstly by taking the emission limit value relevant for each individual fuel and pollutant corresponding to the rated thermal input of the combustion plant as given in Annexes III to VII,
(b) secondly by determining fuel-weighted emission limit values, which are obtained by multiplying the above individual emission limit value by the thermal input delivered by each fuel, the product of multiplication being divided by the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels,
(c) thirdly by aggregating the fuel-weighted limit values.
2. In multi-firing units using the distillation and conversion residues from crude-oil refining for own consumption, alone or with other fuels, the provisions for the fuel with the highest emission limit value (determinative fuel) shall apply, notwithstanding paragraph 1 above, if during the operation of the combustion plant the proportion contributed by that fuel to the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels is at least 50 %.
Where the proportion of the determinative fuel is lower than 50 %, the emission limit value is determined on a pro rata basis of the heat input supplied by the individual fuels in relation to the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels as follows:
(a) firstly by taking the emission limit value relevant for each individual fuel and pollutant corresponding to the rated heat input of the combustion plant as given in Annexes III to VII,
(b) secondly by calculating the emission limit value of the determinative fuel (fuel with the highest emission limit value according to Annexes III to VII and, in the case of two fuels having the same emission limit value, the fuel with the higher thermal input); this value is obtained by multiplying the emission limit value laid down in Annexes III to VII for that fuel by a factor of two, and subtracting from this product the emission limit value of the fuel with the lowest emission limit value,
(c) thirdly by determining the fuel-weighted emission limit values, which are obtained by multiplying the calculated fuel emission limit value by the thermal input of the determinative fuel and the other individual emission limit values by the thermal input delivered by each fuel, the product of multiplication being divided by the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels,
(d) fourthly by aggregating the fuel-weighted emission limit values.
3. As an alternative to paragraph 2, the following average emission limit values for sulphur dioxide may be applied (irrespective of the fuel combination used):
(a) for plants referred to in Article 4(1) and (3): 1000 mg/Nm3, averaged over all such plants within the refinery;
(b) for new plants referred to in Article 4(2): 600 mg/Nm3, averaged over all such plants within the refinery, with the exception of gas turbines.
The competent authorities shall ensure that the application of this provision does not lead to an increase in emissions from existing plants.
4. In the case of plants with a multi-firing unit involving the alternative use of two or more fuels, when granting the licence referred to in Article 4(1) and (2), and in the case of such plants covered by Articles 4(3) or 10, the emission limit values set out in Annexes III to VII corresponding to each fuel used shall be applied.
