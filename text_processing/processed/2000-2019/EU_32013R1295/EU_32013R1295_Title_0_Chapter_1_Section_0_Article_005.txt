Article 5
European added value
1.   Recognising the intrinsic and economic value of culture, the Programme shall support actions and activities with a European added value in the cultural and creative sectors. It shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and its flagship initiatives.
2.   European added value shall be ensured through one or more of the following:
(a)
the transnational character of actions and activities which complement regional, national, international and other Union programmes and policies, and the impact of such actions and activities on the cultural and creative sectors as well as on citizens and on their knowledge of cultures other than their own;
(b)
the development and promotion of transnational cooperation between cultural and creative players, including artists, audiovisual professionals, cultural and creative organisations and audiovisual operators, focused on stimulating more comprehensive, rapid, effective and long-term responses to global challenges;
(c)
the economies of scale and critical mass which Union support fosters, creating a leverage effect for additional funds;
(d)
ensuring a more level playing field in the European cultural and creative sectors by taking account of low production capacity countries and/or countries or regions with a restricted geographical and/or linguistic area.
