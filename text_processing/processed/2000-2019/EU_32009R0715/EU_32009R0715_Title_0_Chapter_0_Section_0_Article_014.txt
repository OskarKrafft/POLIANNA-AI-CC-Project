Article 14
Third-party access services concerning transmission system operators
1.   Transmission system operators shall:
(a)
ensure that they offer services on a non-discriminatory basis to all network users;
(b)
provide both firm and interruptible third-party access services. The price of interruptible capacity shall reflect the probability of interruption;
(c)
offer to network users both long and short-term services.
In regard to point (a) of the first subparagraph, where a transmission system operator offers the same service to different customers, it shall do so under equivalent contractual terms and conditions, either using harmonised transport contracts or a common network code approved by the competent authority in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Directive 2009/73/EC.
2.   Transport contracts signed with non-standard start dates or with a shorter duration than a standard annual transport contract shall not result in arbitrarily higher or lower tariffs that do not reflect the market value of the service, in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 13(1).
3.   Where appropriate, third-party access services may be granted subject to appropriate guarantees from network users with respect to the creditworthiness of such users. Such guarantees shall not constitute undue market-entry barriers and shall be non-discriminatory, transparent and proportionate.
