Article 12
Regional cooperation of transmission system operators
1.   Transmission system operators shall establish regional cooperation within the ENTSO for Gas to contribute to the tasks referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3). In particular, they shall publish a regional investment plan every two years, and may take investment decisions based on that regional investment plan.
2.   Transmission system operators shall promote operational arrangements in order to ensure the optimum management of the network and shall promote the development of energy exchanges, the coordinated allocation of cross-border capacity through non-discriminatory market-based solutions, paying due attention to the specific merits of implicit auctions for short-term allocations and the integration of balancing mechanisms.
3.   For the purposes of achieving the goals set in paragraphs 1 and 2, the geographical area covered by each regional cooperation structure may be defined by the Commission, taking into account existing regional cooperation structures. Each Member State shall be allowed to promote cooperation in more than one geographical area. The measure referred to in the first sentence, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 28(2).
For that purpose, the Commission shall consult the Agency and the ENTSO for Gas.
