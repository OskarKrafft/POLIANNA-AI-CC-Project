Article 7
Amendments of network codes
1.   Draft amendments to any network code adopted under Article 6 may be proposed to the Agency by persons who are likely to have an interest in that network code, including the ENTSO for Gas, transmission system operators, network users and consumers. The Agency may also propose amendments of its own initiative.
2.   The Agency shall consult all stakeholders in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 713/2009. Following this process, the Agency may make reasoned proposals for amendments to the Commission, explaining how such proposals are consistent with the objectives of the network codes set out in Article 6(2) of this Regulation.
3.   The Commission may adopt, taking account of the Agency's proposals, amendments to any network code adopted under Article 6. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 28(2).
4.   Consideration of proposed amendments under the procedure set out in Article 28(2) shall be limited to consideration of the aspects related to the proposed amendment. Those proposed amendments are without prejudice to other amendments which the Commission may propose.
