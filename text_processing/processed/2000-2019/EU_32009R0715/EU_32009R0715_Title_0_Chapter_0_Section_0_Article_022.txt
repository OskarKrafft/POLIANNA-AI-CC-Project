ArticleÂ 22
Trading of capacity rights
Each transmission, storage and LNG system operator shall take reasonable steps to allow capacity rights to be freely tradable and to facilitate such trade in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner. Every such operator shall develop harmonised transport, LNG facility and storage contracts and procedures on the primary market to facilitate secondary trade of capacity and shall recognise the transfer of primary capacity rights where notified by system users.
The harmonised transport, LNG facility and storage contracts and procedures shall be notified to the regulatory authorities.
