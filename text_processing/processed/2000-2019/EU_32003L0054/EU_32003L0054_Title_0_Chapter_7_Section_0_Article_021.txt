Article 21
Market opening and reciprocity
1. Member States shall ensure that the eligible customers are:
(a) until 1 July 2004, the eligible customers as specified in Article 19(1) to (3) of Directive 96/92/EC. Member States shall publish by 31 January each year the criteria for the definition of these eligible customers;
(b) from 1 July 2004, at the latest, all non-household customers;
(c) from 1 July 2007, all customers.
2. To avoid imbalance in the opening of electricity markets:
(a) contracts for the supply of electricity with an eligible customer in the system of another Member State shall not be prohibited if the customer is considered as eligible in both systems involved;
(b) in cases where transactions as described in point (a) are refused because of the customer being eligible only in one of the two systems, the Commission may oblige, taking into account the situation in the market and the common interest, the refusing party to execute the requested supply at the request of the Member State where the eligible customer is located.
