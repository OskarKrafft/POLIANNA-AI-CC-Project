Article 14
Tasks of Distribution System Operators
1. The distribution system operator shall maintain a secure, reliable and efficient electricity distribution system in its area with due regard for the environment.
2. In any event, it must not discriminate between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings.
3. The distribution system operator shall provide system users with the information they need for efficient access to the system.
4. A Member State may require the distribution system operator, when dispatching generating installations, to give priority to generating installations using renewable energy sources or waste or producing combined heat and power.
5. Distribution system operators shall procure the energy they use to cover energy losses and reserve capacity in their system according to transparent, non-discriminatory and market based procedures, whenever they have this function. This requirement shall be without prejudice to using electricity acquired under contracts concluded before 1 January 2002.
6. Where distribution system operators are responsible for balancing the electricity distribution system, rules adopted by them for that purpose shall be objective, transparent and non discriminatory, including rules for the charging of system users of their networks for energy imbalance. Terms and conditions, including rules and tariffs, for the provision of such services by distribution system operators shall be established in accordance with Article 23(2) in a non discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published.
7. When planning the development of the distribution network, energy efficiency/demand-side management measures and/or distributed generation that might supplant the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity shall be considered by the distribution system operator.
