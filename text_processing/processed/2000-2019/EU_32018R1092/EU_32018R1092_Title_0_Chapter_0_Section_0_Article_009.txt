Article 9
Consortium
1.   Where the Union's financial assistance is provided by means of a grant, the members of any consortium wishing to participate in an action shall appoint one of its members to act as coordinator. The coordinator shall be identified in the grant agreement. The coordinator shall be the principal point of contact between the members of the consortium in relations with the Commission or the relevant funding body, unless specified otherwise in the grant agreement or in the event of non-compliance with its obligations under the grant agreement.
2.   The members of a consortium participating in an action shall conclude an internal agreement establishing their rights and obligations with respect to the carrying out of the action in accordance with the grant agreement, except in duly justified cases provided for in the work programme or in the call for proposals. The internal agreement shall also include arrangements regarding the intellectual property rights relating to the products and technologies developed.
