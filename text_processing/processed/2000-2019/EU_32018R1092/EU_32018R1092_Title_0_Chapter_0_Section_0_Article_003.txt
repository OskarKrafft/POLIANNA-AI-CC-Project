Article 3
Objectives
The Programme shall have the following objectives:
(a)
to foster the competitiveness, efficiency and innovation capacity of the defence industry throughout the Union, which contributes to the Union's strategic autonomy, by supporting actions in their development phase;
(b)
to support and leverage cooperation, including across borders, between undertakings, including SMEs and mid-caps, throughout the Union, and collaboration between Member States, in the development of defence products or technologies, while strengthening and improving the agility of defence supply and value chains, and fostering the standardisation of defence systems and their interoperability.
Such cooperation shall take place in line with defence capability priorities agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and particularly in the context of the Capability Development Plan.
In that context, regional and international priorities, when they serve the Union's security and defence interests as determined under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and taking into account the need to avoid unnecessary duplication, may also be taken into account, where appropriate, wherever they do not exclude the possibility of participation of any Member State;
(c)
to foster better exploitation of the results of defence research and contribute to development after the research phase, thereby supporting the competitiveness of the European defence industry on the internal market and the global marketplace, including by consolidation, where appropriate.
