Article 17
Verification of non-conformity
If a Member State finds that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units accompanied by an EC certificate of conformity or bearing an EC type-approval mark do not conform to the approved type, it may ask the Member State which granted the EC type-approval to verify that the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced conform to the approved type.
Such action shall be taken as soon as possible, and in any case within six months of the date of the request.
