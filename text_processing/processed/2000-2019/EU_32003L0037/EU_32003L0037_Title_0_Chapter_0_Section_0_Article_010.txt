Article 10
End-of-series vehicles
1. For end-of-series vehicles, Member States may, at the request of the manufacturer, within the quantitative limits set out in Annex V, Section B, and for the limited period specified in the third subparagraph, register and permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles that conform to a type of vehicle the approval of which is no longer valid.
The first subparagraph shall apply solely to vehicles which:
(a) are on Community territory, and
(b) are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued when the EC type-approval of the vehicle in question was still valid, but which was not registered or placed in service before the said approval lost its validity.
This option shall be restricted to a period of 24 months for complete vehicles and 30 months for completed vehicles from the date of expiry of the EC type-approval.
2. In order to apply paragraph 1 to one or more types of vehicles in a specific category, their manufacturer must submit a request to the competent authorities in each Member State affected by the entry into service of that type of vehicle. The request must specify the technical and/or economic grounds on which it is based.
Within three months, these Member States shall decide whether or not to authorise the registration of the type of vehicle in question in their territory, and if so for how many vehicles.
Each Member State affected by the entry into service of these types of vehicles shall be responsible for ensuring that their manufacturer complies with Annex V, Section B.
