Article 21
Notification of the EC type-approval authorities and technical services
1. The Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of the names and addresses of:
(a) the EC type-approval authorities and, where appropriate, the fields for which they are responsible, and
(b) the technical services which they have appointed, specifying for which test procedures each of these bodies has been appointed.
The technical services notified must meet the harmonised standard on the operation of testing laboratories (EN - ISO/IEC 17025:2000) subject to the following conditions:
(i) a manufacturer may be appointed as a technical service only where this is expressly provided for by separate directives or alternative regulations;
(ii) the use of outside equipment by a technical service, with the agreement of the EC type-approval authority, is authorised.
2. A notified technical service shall be presumed to meet the harmonised standard referred to in paragraph 1(b).
However, where appropriate, the Commission may ask the Member States to provide supporting evidence.
3. Services in third countries may be notified as appointed technical services only where this is provided for in a bilateral or multilateral agreement between the Community and the third country in question.
