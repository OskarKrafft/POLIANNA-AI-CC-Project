Article 9
Vehicles produced in small series
For vehicles produced in small series, the number of vehicles registered, offered for sale or put into service each year in each Member State shall be limited to the maximum number of units indicated in Annex V, Section A.
Every year, the Member States shall send the Commission a list of the EC type-approvals of these vehicles. The Member State granting such an EC type-approval shall send a copy of the information documents and the EC type-approval certificate and all its attachments to the approval authorities in the other Member States designated by the manufacturer, stating the nature of the exemptions which have been granted. Within three months, these Member States shall decide whether they accept the EC type-approval for vehicles to be registered within their territory and, if so, for how many vehicles.
