Article 11
Incompatibility of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units
For vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units designed in accordance with techniques or principles that are incompatible with one or more of the requirements of one or more of the separate directives:
(a) a Member State may grant a provisional EC type-approval. In this case, it must, within one month, send a copy of the EC type-approval certificate and its attachments to the approval authorities in the other Member States and to the Commission. At the same time, it shall send the Commission a request for authorisation to grant EC type-approval under this Directive.
That request must be accompanied by a file containing the following information:
(i) the reasons for which the techniques or principles at issue make the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit incompatible with the requirements of one or more of the relevant separate directives;
(ii) a description of the safety, environmental protection or occupational safety issues raised and of the action taken;
(iii) a description of the tests, together with their results, which show that the level of safety, environmental protection and occupational safety guaranteed is at least equivalent to that guaranteed by the requirements of one or more of the relevant separate directives;
(b) within three months of receipt of the complete file, the Commission shall submit a draft decision to the committee referred to in Article 20(1). In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 20(2), the Commission shall decide whether or not to authorise the Member State to grant an EC type-approval under this Directive.
Only the request for an authorisation and the draft decision shall be sent to the Member States in their national language(s);
(c) if the request is approved, the Member State may grant an EC type-approval under this Directive. In this case, the decision must also state whether restrictions are to be imposed on the validity of such EC type-approvals. In no case shall the period of validity of the EC type-approval be less than 36 months;
(d) where the separate directives have been adapted to technical progress in such a way that the types of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units approved under this Article comply with the amended directives, the Member States shall convert those EC type-approvals into EC type-approvals which comply with this Directive, allowing the time needed for the necessary changes to components or separate technical units, in particular, the removal of any references to restrictions or exemptions;
(e) if the action needed to adapt the specific separate directives has not been taken, the validity of the EC type-approvals granted under this Article may be extended, at the request of the Member State having granted the EC type-approval, by means of another Commission decision;
(f) an exemption granted for the first time under this Article can serve as a reference for the Committee referred to in Article 20(1) for further, identical requests.
