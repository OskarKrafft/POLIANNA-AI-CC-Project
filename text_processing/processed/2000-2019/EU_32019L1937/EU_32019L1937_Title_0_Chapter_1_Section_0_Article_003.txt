Article 3
Relationship with other Union acts and national provisions
1.   Where specific rules on the reporting of breaches are provided for in the sector-specific Union acts listed in Part II of the Annex, those rules shall apply. The provisions of this Directive shall be applicable to the extent that a matter is not mandatorily regulated in those sector-specific Union acts.
2.   This Directive shall not affect the responsibility of Member States to ensure national security or their power to protect their essential security interests. In particular, it shall not apply to reports of breaches of the procurement rules involving defence or security aspects unless they are covered by the relevant acts of the Union.
3.   This Directive shall not affect the application of Union or national law relating to any of the following:
(a)
the protection of classified information;
(b)
the protection of legal and medical professional privilege;
(c)
the secrecy of judicial deliberations;
(d)
rules on criminal procedure.
4.   This Directive shall not affect national rules on the exercise by workers of their rights to consult their representatives or trade unions, and on protection against any unjustified detrimental measure prompted by such consultations as well as on the autonomy of the social partners and their right to enter into collective agreements. This is without prejudice to the level of protection granted by this Directive.
