Article 8
Sustainable urban development
In addition to the activities listed in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation, in the case of action involving sustainable urban development as referred to in Article 37(4)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, the ERDF may, where appropriate, support the development of participative, integrated and sustainable strategies to tackle the high concentration of economic, environmental and social problems affecting urban areas.
These strategies shall promote sustainable urban development through activities such as: strengthening economic growth, the rehabilitation of the physical environment, brownfield redevelopment, the preservation and development of natural and cultural heritage, the promotion of entrepreneurship, local employment and community development, and the provision of services to the population taking account of changing demographic structures.
By way of derogation from Article 34(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, and where these activities are implemented through a specific operational programme or priority axis within an operational programme, the ERDF funding of measures under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 may be raised to 15 % of the programme or priority axis concerned.
