by encouraging and improving the joint protection and management of natural and cultural resources, as well as the prevention of natural and technological risks;
(c)
by supporting links between urban and rural areas;
(d)
by reducing isolation through improved access to transport, information and communication networks and services, and cross-border water, waste and energy systems and facilities;
(e)
by developing collaboration, capacity and joint use of infrastructures, in particular in sectors such as health, culture, tourism and education.
In addition, the ERDF may contribute to promoting legal and administrative cooperation, the integration of cross-border labour markets, local employment initiatives, gender equality and equal opportunities, training and social inclusion, and sharing of human resources and facilities for R&TD.
