Article 54
Transitional provisions
1.   Third-country firms shall be able to continue to provide services and activities in Member States, in accordance with national regimes until three years after the adoption by the Commission of a decision in relation to the relevant third country in accordance with Article 47.
2.   If the Commission assesses that there is not a need to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of Articles 35 and 36 in accordance with Article 52(12), a CCP or a trading venue may, before the entry into application of this Regulation, apply to its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The competent authority, taking into account the risks resulting from the application of the access rights under Article 35 or 36 as regards exchange-traded derivatives to the orderly functioning of the relevant CCP or trading venue, may decide that Article 35 or 36 would not apply to the relevant CCP or trading venue, respectively, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives, for a transitional period until 3 July 2019. Where such a transitional period is approved, the CCP or trading venue cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or 36, as regards exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of that transitional period. The competent authority shall notify ESMA, and in the case of a CCP the college of competent authorities for that CCP, when a transitional period is approved.
Where a CCP which has been approved for the transitional arrangements, is connected by close links to one or more trading venues, those trading venues shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or 36 for exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of that transitional period.
Where a trading venue, which has been approved for the transitional arrangements, is connected by close links to one or more CCPs, those CCPs shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or 36 for exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of that transitional period.
