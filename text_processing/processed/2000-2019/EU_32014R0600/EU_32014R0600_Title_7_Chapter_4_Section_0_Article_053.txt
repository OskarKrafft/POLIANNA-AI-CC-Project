(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   A CCP that has been authorised to clear OTC derivative contracts shall accept clearing such contracts on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis, including as regards collateral requirements and fees related to access, regardless of the trading venue. This in particular shall ensure that a trading venue has the right to non-discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts traded on that trading venue are treated in terms of:
(a)
collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent contracts, where the inclusion of such contracts in the close-out and other netting procedures of a CCP based on the applicable insolvency law would not endanger the smooth and orderly functioning, the validity or enforceability of such procedures; and
(b)
cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP under a risk model that complies with Article 41.
A CCP may require that a trading venue comply with the operational and technical requirements established by the CCP, including the risk-management requirements.’;

‘6.   The conditions laid down in paragraph 1 regarding non-discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts traded on that trading venue are treated in terms of collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent contracts and cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP shall be further specified by the technical standards adopted pursuant to Article 35(6)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (*2).’;
