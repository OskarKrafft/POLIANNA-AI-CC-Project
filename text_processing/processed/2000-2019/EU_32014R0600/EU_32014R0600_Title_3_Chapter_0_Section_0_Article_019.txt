Article 19
Monitoring by ESMA
1.   Competent authorities and ESMA shall monitor the application of Article 18 regarding the sizes at which quotes are made available to clients of the investment firm and to other market participants relative to other trading activity of the firm, and the degree to which the quotes reflect prevailing market conditions in relation to transactions in the same or similar financial instruments on a trading venue. By 3 January 2019, ESMA shall submit a report to the Commission on the application of Article 18.

2.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 50 specifying the sizes referred to in Article 18(6) at which a firm shall enter into transactions with any other client to whom the quote is made available. The size specific to the financial instrument shall be determined in accordance with the criteria set in Article 9(5)(d).
3.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 50 clarifying what constitutes a reasonable commercial basis to make quotes public as referred to in Article 18(8).
