Article 5
Types of intervention
1.   Community funding may take the following legal forms:
(a)
grant agreements;
(b)
public procurement contracts.
2.   Community grants may be provided in specific forms, such as framework partnership agreements, participation in financial mechanisms and funds, or co-funding of operating or action grants. Operating grants to bodies pursuing objectives of general European interest shall not be subject to the degressivity provisions of the Financial Regulation.
3.   For action grants, the maximum rate of co-financing shall be 50 % of eligible costs. However, by way of exception, the maximum co-financing rate for LIFE+ Nature and Biodiversity may be up to 75 % of eligible costs in the case of projects concerning priority habitats or species for the implementation of Directive 92/43/EEC or the species of birds considered as a priority for funding by the committee set up pursuant to Article 16 of Directive 79/409/EEC when this is necessary to achieve the conservation objective.
4.   In the case of public procurement contracts, Community funds may cover the costs of purchase of services and goods. These costs may include expenditure on information and communication, preparation, implementation, monitoring, checking and evaluation of projects, policies, programmes and legislation.
5.   Civil servants' salary costs may be funded only to the extent that they relate to the cost of project implementation activities that the relevant public authority would not have carried out had the project concerned not been undertaken. The staff in question must be specifically seconded to a project and they must represent an additional cost with respect to existing permanent staff.
6.   The Commission shall implement this Regulation in accordance with the Financial Regulation.
