Article 6
Programming and project selection
1.   At least 78 % of the budgetary resources for LIFE+ shall be used for action grants for projects.
2.   The Commission shall ensure a proportionate distribution of projects by establishing indicative annual national allocations for the periods 2007-2010 and 2011-2013, based on the following criteria:
(a)
population:
(i)
the total population of each Member State. A weighting of 50 % shall be applied to this criterion;
and
(ii)
the population density of each Member State, up to a limit of twice the EU's average population density. A weighting of 5 % shall be applied to this criterion;
(b)
nature and biodiversity:
(i)
the total area of sites of Community importance for each Member State, expressed as a proportion of the total area of sites of Community importance. A weighting of 25 % shall be applied to this criterion;
and
(ii)
the proportion of a Member State's territory covered by sites of Community importance in relation to the proportion of Community territory covered by sites of Community importance. A weighting of 20 % shall be applied to this criterion.
As soon as relevant data are available for all Member States, the Commission shall make the calculations for nature and biodiversity on the basis of both sites of Community importance and special protection areas, while avoiding double counting.
In addition, the Commission may make additional allocations to land-locked Member States. The total amount of such allocations shall not exceed 3 % of the total budgetary resources dedicated to action grants for projects.
However, the Commission shall ensure that no Member State's allocation is less than an appropriate minimum allocation of between EUR 1 and 3 million per year, taking into account population density, environmental expenditure, environmental need and absorption capacity.
3.   The multi-annual strategic programme set out in Annex II specifies the priority areas of action for Community funding in relation to the objectives and criteria set out in Articles 1, 3 and 4.
Member States may, for the part of the budget to be used for action grants for projects, submit to the Commission national annual priorities selected from Annex II that, as appropriate:
(a)
identify priority areas and types of projects, taking account of identified long-term needs;
and
(b)
outline specific national objectives.
If a Member State decides to submit national annual priorities to the Commission, it may include transnational priorities.
4.   If a Member State decides to submit national annual priorities to the Commission, it shall do so as soon as possible, and no later than the date specified in accordance with Article 14(2)(a). No such priorities shall be submitted with respect to the annual call for proposals for the 2007 budget.
5.   The Commission shall make an annual call for proposals for the components listed in Article 4(1), having regard, in particular, to the multi-annual strategic programme set out in Annex II and any national annual priorities submitted in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.
6.   Member States shall forward all proposals for projects to be financed to the Commission. In the case of transnational projects, the Member State in which the beneficiary is registered shall forward the proposal. The project shall count proportionately towards the indicative national allocations of the Member States involved.
Member States may provide written comments on individual project proposals. They may comment, in particular, on whether a proposal corresponds to the national annual priorities selected from Annex II.
7.   The Commission shall select projects on the basis of the objectives and criteria set out in Articles 1, 3 and 4 and in Annexes I and II.
When compiling the list of projects considered for financial support in accordance with the indicative national allocations established pursuant to paragraph 2, the Commission shall give priority to those projects that make the greatest contribution to the achievement of Community objectives, taking into account:
(a)
national priorities submitted in accordance with paragraph 4;
and
(b)
comments from Member States on individual project proposals pursuant to paragraph 6.
The Commission shall have special regard to transnational projects when transnational cooperation is essential to guarantee environmental protection, in particular species conservation, and shall endeavour to ensure that at least 15 % of the budgetary resources dedicated to action grants for projects are allocated to transnational projects.
8.   If the sum of co-financing necessary for projects on the list compiled in accordance with paragraph 7 with respect to a given Member State is less than the indicative allocation for that Member State based on the criteria set out in paragraph 2, the Commission shall use the balance to co-finance those projects submitted by other Member States that make the greatest contribution to the achievement of the Community objectives set out in Articles 1, 3 and 4 and Annexes I and II.
9.   When proposing the list of projects to be co-financed to the Committee referred to in Article 13(1), the Commission shall provide a written explanation of how it had regard to the allocation criteria established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article and national annual priorities and comments submitted in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 6 of this Article, while respecting the objectives and criteria set out in Articles 1, 3 and 4.
10.   The Commission shall regularly publish lists of projects financed through LIFE+, including a short description of objectives and results achieved and a summary of funds expended. It shall do so using appropriate media and technologies, including the Internet.
