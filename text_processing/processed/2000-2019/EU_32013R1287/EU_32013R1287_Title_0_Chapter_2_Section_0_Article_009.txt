Article 9
Actions to improve access to markets
1.   To continue improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises, the Commission may support actions to improve SME access to the internal market, such as information provision (including through digital services) and awareness-raising in relation to, among others, Union programmes, law and standards.
2.   Specific measures shall aim to facilitate SME access to markets outside the Union. Such measures may include providing information on existing barriers to market entry and business opportunities, public procurement and customs procedures, and improving support services in terms of standards and intellectual property rights in priority third countries. Those measures shall complement but not duplicate the core trade promotion activities of Member States.
3.   Actions under the COSME programme may aim to foster international cooperation, including industrial and regulatory dialogues with third countries. Specific measures may aim to reduce differences between the Union and other countries in terms of regulatory frameworks for products, to contribute to the development of enterprise and industrial policy and to contribute to the improvement of the business environment.
