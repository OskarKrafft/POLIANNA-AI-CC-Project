Article 8
Actions to improve access to finance for SMEs
1.   The Commission shall support actions which aim to facilitate and improve access to finance for SMEs in their start-up, growth and transfer phases, being complementary to the Member States' use of financial instruments for SMEs at national and regional level. In order to ensure complementarity, such actions shall be closely coordinated with those undertaken in the framework of cohesion policy, the Horizon 2020 programme and at national or regional level. Such actions shall aim to stimulate the take-up and supply of both equity and debt finance, which may include seed funding, angel funding and quasi-equity financing subject to market demand but excluding asset stripping.
2.   In addition to the actions referred to in paragraph 1, Union support may also be given to actions to improve cross-border and multi-country financing, subject to market demand, thereby assisting SMEs to internationalise their activities in compliance with Union law.
The Commission may also examine the possibility of developing innovative financial mechanisms, such as crowdfunding, subject to market demand.
3.   Details of the actions referred to in paragraph 1 are laid down in Article 17.
