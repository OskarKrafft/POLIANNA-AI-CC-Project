Article 13
Replacement of Union inland navigation certificates
Each Member State shall lay down the conditions under which a valid Union inland navigation certificate which has been lost or damaged may be replaced. Those conditions shall require craft applying for replacement, in the case of loss, to provide a declaration of the loss of the certificate, or in the case of damage, to return the damaged certificate. The replacement certificate shall state that it is a duplicate.
