Article 21
Recognition of classification societies
1.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in order to recognise a classification society which meets the criteria listed in Annex VI, or to withdraw recognition, in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
2.   An application for recognition shall be submitted to the Commission by the Member State in which the classification society has its headquarters or a subsidiary authorised to issue attestations that a craft satisfies the requirements referred to in Annexes II and V in accordance with this Directive. This application shall be accompanied by all information and documentation needed to check that the criteria for recognition are met.
3.   Any Member State may submit to the Commission a request to withdraw the recognition if it considers that a classification society no longer meets the criteria set out in Annex VI. The request for withdrawal shall be accompanied by documentary evidence.
4.   The classification societies which, by 6 October 2016, have been granted recognition in accordance with Directive 2006/87/EC shall retain their recognition.
5.   The Commission shall publish for the first time by 7 October 2017, and shall keep updated on an appropriate website, a list of the classification societies recognised in accordance with this Article. Member States shall communicate to the Commission any changes relating to the names or addresses of the classification societies for which they have applied for recognition.
