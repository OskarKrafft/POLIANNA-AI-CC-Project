Article 29
Craft excluded from the scope of Directive 82/714/EEC
1.   The Union inland navigation certificate shall be issued to craft excluded from the scope of Council Directive 82/714/EEC (12), but covered by this Directive in accordance with Article 2(1) of this Directive, following a technical inspection to check whether the craft comply with the technical requirements referred to in Annexes II and V to this Directive. That technical inspection shall be carried out upon the expiry of the craft's current certificate, and in any event no later than 30 December 2018.
2.   Any failure to meet the technical requirements referred to in Annexes II and V shall be specified in the Union inland navigation certificate. Provided that the competent authorities consider that these shortcomings do not constitute a manifest danger, the craft referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may continue to operate until such time as those components or areas of the craft which have been certified as not meeting those requirements are replaced or altered, following which those components or areas shall meet the technical requirements referred to in Annexes II and V.
3.   The replacement of existing parts with identical parts or parts of an equivalent technology and design during routine repairs and maintenance shall not be considered to be a replacement or an alteration within the meaning of paragraph 2.
4.   Manifest danger within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article shall be presumed in particular when requirements concerning the structural soundness, navigation or manoeuvrability or special features of the craft in accordance with the technical requirements referred to in Annexes II and V are affected. Derogations that are provided for in the technical requirements referred to in Annexes II and V shall not be identified as shortcomings which constitute a manifest danger.
