Review
The Commission shall submit, before 7 October 2021, a report to the European Parliament and to the Council reviewing the effectiveness of the measures introduced by this Directive, particularly as regards the harmonisation of technical requirements and the development of technical standards for inland navigation. The report shall also review the mechanisms for cooperation with international organisations competent for inland navigation. The report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal to further streamline cooperation and coordination in establishing standards to which reference can be made in legal acts of the Union. The Commission shall submit a similar report following any major developments in inland waterway transport.
