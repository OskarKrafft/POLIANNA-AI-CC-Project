Article 90
Termination of contracts
Member States shall ensure that contracting entities have the possibility, at least under the following circumstances and under the conditions determined by the applicable national law, to terminate a works, supply or service contract during its term, where:
(a)
the contract has been subject to a substantial modification which would have required a new procurement procedure pursuant to Article 89;
(b)
the contractor has, at the time of contract award, been in one of the situations referred to in Article 57(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU and should therefore have been excluded from the procurement procedure pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 80(1) of this Directive;
(c)
the contract should not have been awarded to the contractor in view of a serious infringement of the obligations under the Treaties and this Directive that has been declared by the Court of Justice of the European Union in a procedure under Article 258 TFEU.
