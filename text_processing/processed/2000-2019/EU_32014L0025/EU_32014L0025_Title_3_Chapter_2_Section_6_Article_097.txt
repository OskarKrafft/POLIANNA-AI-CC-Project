Article 97
Rules on the organisation of design contests, the selection of participants and the jury
1.   When organising design contests, contracting entities shall apply procedures which are adapted to Title I and this Chapter.
2.   The admission of participants to design contests shall not be limited:
(a)
by reference to the territory or part of the territory of a Member State;
(b)
on the grounds that, under the law of the Member State in which the contest is organised, they would be required to be either natural or legal persons.
3.   Where design contests are restricted to a limited number of participants, contracting entities shall establish clear and non-discriminatory selection criteria. In any event, the number of candidates invited to participate shall be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
4.   The jury shall be composed exclusively of natural persons who are independent of participants in the contest. Where a particular professional qualification is required of participants in a contest, at least a third of the jury members shall have that qualification or an equivalent qualification.
