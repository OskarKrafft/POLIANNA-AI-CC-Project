Article 26
Procurement covering several activities and involving defence or security aspects
1.   In the case of contracts intended to cover several activities, contracting entities may choose to award separate contracts for the purposes of each separate activity or to award a single contract. Where contracting entities choose to award separate contracts for separate parts, the decision of which legal regime applies to any one of such separate contracts shall be taken on the basis of the characteristics of the separate activity concerned.
Where contracting entities choose to award a single contract, paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply. The choice between awarding a single contract and awarding a number of separate contracts shall not be made with the objective of excluding the contract or contracts from the scope of this Directive or Directive 2009/81/EC.
2.   In the case of contracts intended to cover an activity which is subject to this Directive and another which is:
(a)
subject to Directive 2009/81/EC, or
(b)
covered by Article 346 TFEU,
the contract may be awarded in accordance with Directive 2009/81/EC in the cases set out under point (a) and may be awarded without applying this Directive in the cases set out under point (b). This subparagraph is without prejudice to the thresholds and exclusions for which Directive 2009/81/EC provides.
Contracts as set out under point (a) of the first subparagraph, which in addition include procurement or other elements which are covered by Article 346 TFEU, may be awarded without applying this Directive.
However, it is a condition for the application of the first and second subparagraph that the award of a single contract is justified for objective reasons and the decision to award a single contract is not taken for the purpose of excluding contracts from the application of this Directive.
