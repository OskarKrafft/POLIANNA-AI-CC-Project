Article 108
Review
The Commission shall review the economic effects on the internal market, in particular in terms of factors such as the cross-border award of contracts and transaction costs, resulting from the application of the thresholds set in Article 15 and report thereon to the European Parliament and the Council by 18 April 2019.
The Commission shall, where possible and appropriate, consider suggesting an increase of the threshold amounts applicable under the GPA during the next round of negotiations. In the event of any change to the threshold amounts applicable under the GPA, the report shall, if appropriate, be followed by a legislative proposal amending the thresholds set out in this Directive.
