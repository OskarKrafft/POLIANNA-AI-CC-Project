Article 9
Electricity
1.   As far as electricity is concerned, this Directive shall apply to the following activities:
(a)
the provision or operation of fixed networks intended to provide a service to the public in connection with the production, transport or distribution of electricity;
(b)
the supply of electricity to such networks.
2.   The supply, by a contracting entity other than a contracting authority, of electricity to fixed networks which provide a service to the public shall not be considered to be a relevant activity within the meaning of paragraph 1 where all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the production of electricity by that contracting entity takes place because its consumption is necessary for carrying out an activity other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or in Articles 8, 10 and 11;
(b)
supply to the public network depends only on that contracting entity’s own consumption and has not exceeded 30 % of that contracting entity’s total production of energy, on the basis of the average for the preceding three years, including the current year.
