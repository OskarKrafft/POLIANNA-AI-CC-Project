Article 101
National reporting and statistical information
1.   The Commission shall review the quality and completeness of data that can be extracted from the notices, referred to in Articles 67 to 71, 92 and 96, which are published in accordance with Annex IX.
Where the quality and completeness of the data referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is not compliant with the obligations stipulated in Articles 67(1), Article 68(1), Article 69, Article 70(1), Article 92(3) and Article 96(2), the Commission shall request complementary information from the Member State concerned. Within a reasonable time, the Member State concerned shall supply the missing statistical information requested by the Commission.
2.   By 18 April 2017 and every three years thereafter, Member States shall forward to the Commission a statistical report for procurement which would have been covered by this Directive if its value had exceeded the relevant threshold laid down in Article 15, indicating an estimation of the aggregated total value of such procurement during the period concerned. That estimation may, in particular, be based on data available under national publication requirements or on sample-based estimates.
That report may be included in the report referred to in Article 99(3).
