Article 7
Derogations from the rules of eligibility and origin
1.   In duly substantiated exceptional cases, the Commission may extend eligibility to legal persons from a country not eligible under Article 3.
2.   In duly substantiated exceptional cases, the Commission may allow the purchase of supplies and materials originating from a country not eligible under Article 3.
3.   Derogations as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 may be justified on the basis of the unavailability of products and services in the markets of the countries concerned, for reasons of extreme urgency, or if the eligibility rules would make the realisation of a project, a programme or an action impossible or exceedingly difficult.
