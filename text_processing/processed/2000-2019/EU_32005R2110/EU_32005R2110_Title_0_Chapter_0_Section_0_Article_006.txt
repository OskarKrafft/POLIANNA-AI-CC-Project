Article 6
Reciprocity with third countries
1.   Reciprocal access to the Community’s external assistance shall be granted for a country falling within the scope of Article 3(4), whenever such country grants eligibility on equal terms to the Member States and to the recipient country concerned.
2.   The granting of reciprocal access to the Community’s external assistance shall be based on a comparison between the EU and other donors and shall proceed at sectoral level, as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee categories, or at country level, regardless of whether the country concerned is a donor or a recipient country. The decision to grant such reciprocity to a donor country shall be based on the transparency, consistency and proportionality of the aid provided by that donor, including its qualitative and quantitative nature.
3.   Reciprocal access to the Community’s external assistance shall be established by means of a specific decision concerning a given country or a given regional group of countries. Such a decision shall be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (7) under the procedures and relevant committee associated with the act concerned. The right of the European Parliament to be regularly informed pursuant to Article 7(3) of that Decision shall be fully respected. Such a decision shall run for a minimum period of one year.
4.   Reciprocal access to the Community’s external assistance in the least developed countries as listed in Annex II shall be automatically granted to the third countries listed in Annex III.
5.   The recipient countries shall be consulted as part of the procedure described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
