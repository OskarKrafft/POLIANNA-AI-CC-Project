Article 23
Issue of permits
1.   Member States shall require any establishment or undertaking intending to carry out waste treatment to obtain a permit from the competent authority.
Such permits shall specify at least the following:
(a)
the types and quantities of waste that may be treated;
(b)
for each type of operation permitted, the technical and any other requirements relevant to the site concerned;
(c)
the safety and precautionary measures to be taken;
(d)
the method to be used for each type of operation;
(e)
such monitoring and control operations as may be necessary;
(f)
such closure and after-care provisions as may be necessary.
2.   Permits may be granted for a specified period and may be renewable.
3.   Where the competent authority considers that the intended method of treatment is unacceptable from the point of view of environmental protection, in particular when the method is not in accordance with Article 13, it shall refuse to issue the permit.
4.   It shall be a condition of any permit covering incineration or co-incineration with energy recovery that the recovery of energy take place with a high level of energy efficiency.
5.   Provided that the requirements of this Article are complied with, any permit produced pursuant to other national or Community legislation may be combined with the permit required under paragraph 1 to form a single permit, where such a format obviates the unnecessary duplication of information and the repetition of work by the operator or the competent authority.
