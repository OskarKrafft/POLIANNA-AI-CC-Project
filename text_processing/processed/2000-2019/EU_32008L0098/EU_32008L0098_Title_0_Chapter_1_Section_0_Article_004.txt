Article 4
Waste hierarchy
1.   The following waste hierarchy shall apply as a priority order in waste prevention and management legislation and policy:
(a)
prevention;
(b)
preparing for re-use;
(c)
recycling;
(d)
other recovery, e.g. energy recovery; and
(e)
disposal.
2.   When applying the waste hierarchy referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall take measures to encourage the options that deliver the best overall environmental outcome. This may require specific waste streams departing from the hierarchy where this is justified by life-cycle thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste.
Member States shall ensure that the development of waste legislation and policy is a fully transparent process, observing existing national rules about the consultation and involvement of citizens and stakeholders.
Member States shall take into account the general environmental protection principles of precaution and sustainability, technical feasibility and economic viability, protection of resources as well as the overall environmental, human health, economic and social impacts, in accordance with Articles 1 and 13.
