Article 3
Eligibility of projects and applications for Community financial aid
1.   Only projects of common interest shall be eligible to receive Community financial aid under this Regulation.
The eligibility of applications for Community financial aid for such projects is conditional on compliance with Community law.
2.   In the field of transport only, eligibility shall also be subject to a commitment by the applicant for Community financial aid and, where appropriate, by the Member States concerned, to make a financial contribution to the project submitted, mobilising private funds if necessary.
3.   Transport-related projects involving a cross-border section or a part of such a section shall be eligible to receive Community financial aid if there is a written agreement between the Member States concerned or between the Member States and third countries concerned relating to the completion of the cross-border section. Exceptionally, when a project is necessary to link to the network of a neighbouring Member State or a third country but does not actually cross the border, the written agreement referred to above shall not be required.
