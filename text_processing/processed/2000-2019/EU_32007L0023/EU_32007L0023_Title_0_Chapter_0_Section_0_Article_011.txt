Article 11
Obligation to affix the CE marking
1.   After having successfully completed the conformity assessment in accordance with Article 9, manufacturers shall visibly, legibly and indelibly affix the CE marking to the pyrotechnic articles themselves or, if this is not possible, to an identification plate attached thereto or to the packaging. The identification plate must be so designed as to make its reuse impossible.
The model to be used for the CE marking shall be in accordance with Decision 93/465/EEC.
2.   No marking or inscription which may confuse third persons as to the meaning and form of the CE marking may be affixed to pyrotechnic articles. Any other marking may be affixed to pyrotechnic articles provided the visibility and legibility of the CE marking is not impaired.
3.   Where pyrotechnic articles are subject to other Community legislation which covers other aspects of, and prescribes the affixing of, the CE marking, this marking shall indicate that those articles are also presumed to conform to the provisions of the other legislation which applies to them.
