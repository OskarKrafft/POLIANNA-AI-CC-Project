Article 8
Harmonised standards
1.   The Commission may, in accordance with the procedures laid down by Directive 98/34/EC, request the European standardisation bodies to draw up or revise European standards in support of this Directive or encourage the relevant international bodies to draw up or revise international standards.
2.   The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union the references of such harmonised standards.
3.   Member States shall ensure that the harmonised standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union are acknowledged and adopted. Member States shall consider pyrotechnic articles falling within the scope of this Directive which comply with the relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standards published in the Official Journal of the European Union to be in conformity with the essential safety requirements set out in Annex I. Member States shall publish the references of the national standards transposing those harmonised standards.
When Member States adopt national transpositions of the harmonised standards they shall publish the reference numbers of those transpositions.
4.   Where a Member State or the Commission considers that the harmonised standards referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article do not fully satisfy the essential safety requirements set out in Annex I, the Commission or the Member State concerned shall refer the matter to the Standing Committee set up by Directive 98/34/EC, giving its reasons. The Standing Committee shall deliver its opinion within six months of such referral. In the light of the Standing Committee's opinion the Commission shall inform the Member States of the measures to be taken regarding the harmonised standards and the publication referred to in paragraph 2.
