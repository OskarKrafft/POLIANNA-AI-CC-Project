Article 17
Measures entailing refusal or restriction
1.   Any measure taken pursuant to this Directive,
(a)
to prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of a product; or
(b)
to withdraw a product from the market,
shall state the exact grounds on which it is based. Such measures shall be notified without delay to the party concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to him under the national law of the Member State concerned, and of the time limits to which such remedies are subject.
2.   In the event of a measure referred to in paragraph 1, the party concerned shall have an opportunity to put forward his views in advance, unless such consultation is not possible because of the urgency of the measure to be taken, as justified in particular by public health or safety requirements.
