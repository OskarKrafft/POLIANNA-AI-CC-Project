5.   The EIB shall use the EU guarantee for supporting investment platforms or funds and national promotional banks or institutions that invest in operations meeting the requirements of this Regulation (eligible vehicles), after approval by the Investment Committee.
The Steering Board shall specify policies, in accordance with Article 7(2), regarding eligible vehicles referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.

In addition, the EIB may use the EU guarantee to meet the relevant share of any recovery costs, unless deducted from recovery proceeds, and any costs linked to liquidity management.
In the event that the EIB provides funding or guarantees to the EIF on behalf of the EFSI which are backed by the EU guarantee in accordance with Article 11(3), fees of the EIF may be met by the general budget of the Union to the extent that they are not deducted from the remuneration referred to in Article 4(2)(c)(ii) or from revenues, recoveries or other payments received by the EIF.

The Commission shall, as appropriate, provide guidance on combining the use of Union instruments with EIB financing under the EU guarantee, so as to ensure coordination, complementarity and synergies.
