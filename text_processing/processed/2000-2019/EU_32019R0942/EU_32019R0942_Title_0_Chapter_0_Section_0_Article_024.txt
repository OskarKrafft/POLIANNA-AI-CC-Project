Before submitting draft opinions, recommendations or decisions to a vote by the Board of Regulators, the Director shall submit proposals for the draft opinions, recommendations or decisions to the relevant working group for consultation sufficiently in advance.
The Director:

shall take the comments and amendments of the Board of Regulators into account and shall resubmit the revised draft opinion, recommendation or decision to the Board of Regulators for a favourable opinion;

may withdraw submitted draft opinions, recommendations or decisions provided that the Director submits a duly justified written explanation where the Director disagrees with the amendments submitted by the Board of Regulators;
