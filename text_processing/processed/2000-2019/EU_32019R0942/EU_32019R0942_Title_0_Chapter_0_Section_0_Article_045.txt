Article 45
Evaluation
1.   By 5 July 2024, and every five years thereafter, the Commission, with the assistance of an independent external expert, shall carry out an evaluation to assess ACER's performance in relation to its objectives, mandate and tasks. The evaluation shall in particular address the possible need to modify ACER's mandate, and the financial implications of any such modification.
2.   Where the Commission considers that the continued existence of ACER is no longer justified with regard to its assigned objectives, mandate and tasks, it may propose that this Regulation be amended accordingly or repealed after carrying out an appropriate consultation of stakeholders and of the Board of Regulators.
3.   The Commission shall submit the evaluation findings referred to in paragraph 1 together with its conclusions to the European Parliament, to the Council and to ACER's Board of Regulators. The findings of the evaluation should be made public.
4.   By 31 October 2025, and at least every five years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report evaluating this Regulation and, in particular, ACER's tasks involving individual decisions. That reports shall, as appropriate, take into account the results of the assessment pursuant to Article 69(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943.
The Commission, where appropriate, shall submit a legislative proposal together with its report.
