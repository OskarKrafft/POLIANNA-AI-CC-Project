Article 32
Fees
1.   Fees shall be due to ACER for the following:
(a)
requesting an exemption decision pursuant to Article 10 of this Regulation and for decisions on cross-border cost allocation provided by ACER pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013;
(b)
collecting, handling, processing and analysing of information reported by market participants or by entities reporting on their behalf pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011.
2.   The fees referred to in paragraph 1, and the way in which they are to be paid, shall be set by the Commission after carrying out a public consultation and after consulting the Administrative Board and the Board of Regulators. The fees shall be proportionate to the costs of the relevant services as provided in a cost-effective way and shall be sufficient to cover those costs. Those fees shall be set at such a level as to ensure that they are non-discriminatory and that they avoid placing an undue financial or administrative burden on market participants or entities acting on their behalf.
The Commission shall regularly examine the level of those fees on the basis of an evaluation and, if necessary, shall adapt the level of those fees and the way in which they are to be paid.
