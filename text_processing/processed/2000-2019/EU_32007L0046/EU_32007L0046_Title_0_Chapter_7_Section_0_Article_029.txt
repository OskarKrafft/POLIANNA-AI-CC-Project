Article 29
Vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units in compliance with this Directive
1.   If a Member State finds that new vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, albeit in compliance with the applicable requirements or properly marked, present a serious risk to road safety, or seriously harm the environment or public health, that Member State may, for a maximum period of six months, refuse to register such vehicles or to permit the sale or entry into service in its territory of such vehicles, components or separate technical units.
In such cases, the Member State concerned shall immediately notify the manufacturer, the other Member States and the Commission accordingly, stating the reasons on which its decision is based and, in particular, whether it is the result of:
—
shortcomings in the relevant regulatory acts, or
—
incorrect application of the relevant requirements.
2.   The Commission shall consult the parties concerned as soon as possible and, in particular, the approval authority that granted the type-approval in order to prepare the decision.
3.   Where the measures referred to in paragraph 1 are attributed to shortcomings in the relevant regulatory acts, the appropriate measures shall be taken as follows:
—
where separate directives or regulations listed in Part I of Annex IV are concerned, the Commission shall amend them in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 40(2),
—
where UNECE Regulations are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary draft amendments to the relevant UNECE Regulations in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.
4.   Where the measures referred to in paragraph 1 are attributed to incorrect application of the relevant requirements, the Commission shall take the appropriate measures to ensure compliance with such requirements.
