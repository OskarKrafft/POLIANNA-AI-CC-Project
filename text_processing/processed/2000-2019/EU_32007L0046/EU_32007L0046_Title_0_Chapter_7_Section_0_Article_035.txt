Article 35
Equivalence of UNECE Regulations with directives or regulations
1.   The UNECE Regulations listed in Part II of Annex IV are recognised as being equivalent to the corresponding separate directives or regulations in as much as they share the same scope and subject matter.
The approval authorities of the Member States shall accept approvals granted in accordance with those UNECE Regulations and, where applicable, the pertaining approval marks, in lieu of the corresponding approvals and approval marks granted in accordance with the equivalent separate directive or regulation.
2.   Where the Community has decided to apply, for the purposes of paragraph 1, a new UNECE Regulation or a UNECE Regulation as amended, Part II of Annex IV shall be amended as appropriate. These measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 40(2).
