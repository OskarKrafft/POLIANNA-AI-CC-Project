Action required
1.   Where the Commission finds that there are sound grounds for granting an exemption pursuant to Article 20, it shall immediately take the necessary steps to adapt the separate directives or regulations concerned to technological developments. These measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of the separate directives or regulations listed in Part I of Annex IV shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 40(2).
Where the exemption pursuant to Article 20 relates to a UNECE Regulation, the Commission shall propose an amendment to the relevant UNECE Regulation in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.
2.   As soon as the relevant regulatory acts have been amended, any restriction attaching to the exemption shall be lifted immediately.
If the necessary steps to adapt the regulatory acts have not been taken, the validity of an exemption may be extended, at the request of the Member State which granted the approval, by another decision adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 40(3).
