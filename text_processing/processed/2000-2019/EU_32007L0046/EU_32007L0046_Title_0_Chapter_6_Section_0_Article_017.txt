Article 17
Termination of validity
1.   An EC type-approval of a vehicle shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases:
(a)
new requirements in any regulatory act applicable to the approved vehicle become mandatory for the registration, sale or entry into service of new vehicles, and it is not possible to update the approval accordingly;
(b)
production of the approved vehicle is definitively discontinued voluntarily;
(c)
the validity of the approval expires by virtue of a special restriction.
2.   Where only one variant within a type or one version within a variant becomes invalid, the EC type-approval of the vehicle in question shall lose validity only in so far as the particular variant or version is concerned.
3.   When production of a particular type of vehicle is definitively discontinued, the manufacturer shall notify the approval authority that granted the EC type-approval for that vehicle. Upon receiving such notification, that authority shall inform the approval authorities of the other Member States accordingly within 20 working days.
Article 27 shall apply only to discontinuation in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1(a) of this Article.
4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3, in cases where an EC type-approval of a vehicle is due to become invalid, the manufacturer shall notify the approval authority that granted the EC type-approval.
The approval authority shall without unjustified delay communicate all relevant information to the approval authorities of the other Member States so as to enable the application, where appropriate, of Article 27. That communication shall specify, in particular, the date of production and the vehicle identification number of the last vehicle produced.
