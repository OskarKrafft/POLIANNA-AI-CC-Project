Article 12
Conformity of production arrangements
1.   The Member State which grants an EC type-approval shall take the necessary measures in accordance with Annex X to verify, if need be in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that production vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, as the case may be, conform to the approved type.
2.   The Member State which has granted an EC type-approval shall take the necessary measures in accordance with Annex X in relation to that approval to verify, if need be in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be adequate and that production vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, as the case may be, continue to conform to the approved type.
Verification to ensure that products conform to the approved type shall be limited to the procedures set out in Annex X and in those regulatory acts that contain specific requirements. To that end, the approval authority of the Member State which has granted the EC type-approval may carry out any of the checks or tests prescribed in any of the regulatory acts listed in Annex IV or Annex XI on samples taken in the premises of the manufacturer, including production facilities.
3.   When a Member State which has granted an EC type-approval establishes that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 are not being applied, deviate significantly from the arrangements and control plans agreed, or have ceased to be applied, although production is not discontinued, that Member State shall take the necessary measures, including the withdrawal of the type-approval, to ensure that the conformity of production procedure is followed correctly.
