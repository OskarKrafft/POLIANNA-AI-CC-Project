Article 38
Information intended for manufacturers of components or separate technical units
1.   The vehicle manufacturer shall make available to the manufacturers of components or separate technical units all those particulars including, as the case may be, drawings specifically listed in the annex or appendix to a regulatory act that are necessary for EC type-approval of components or separate technical units, or necessary to obtain an authorisation under Article 31.
The vehicle manufacturer may impose a binding agreement on the manufacturers of components or separate technical units to protect the confidentiality of any information that is not in the public domain, including what is related to intellectual property rights.
2.   The manufacturer of components or separate technical units, in his capacity as the holder of an EC type-approval certificate which, in accordance with Article 10(4), includes restrictions on use or special mounting conditions or both, shall provide all the detailed information thereon to the vehicle manufacturer.
Where a regulatory act makes provision for so doing, the manufacturer of components or separate technical units shall provide, together with the components or separate technical units produced, instructions regarding restrictions on use or special mounting conditions or both.
