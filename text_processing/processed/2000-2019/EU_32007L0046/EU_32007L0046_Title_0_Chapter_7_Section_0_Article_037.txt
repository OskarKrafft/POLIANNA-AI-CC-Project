Article 37
Information intended for users
1.   The manufacturer may not supply any technical information related to the particulars provided for in this Directive or in the regulatory acts listed in Annex IV which diverges from the particulars approved by the approval authority.
2.   Where a regulatory act makes specific provisions for so doing, the manufacturer shall make available to users all relevant information and necessary instructions describing any special conditions or restrictions attaching to the use of a vehicle, a component or a separate technical unit.
That information shall be supplied in the official languages of the Community. It shall be provided, in agreement with the approval authority, in an appropriate supporting document, such as the owner’s manual or the maintenance book.
