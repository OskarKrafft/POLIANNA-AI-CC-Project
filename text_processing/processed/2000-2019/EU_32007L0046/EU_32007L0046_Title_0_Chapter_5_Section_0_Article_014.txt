Article 14
Specific provisions concerning vehicles
1.   If particulars recorded in the information package have changed, the amendment shall be designated a ‘revision’.
In such cases, the approval authority shall issue the revised page of the information package as necessary, marking each revised pages to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of re-issue. A consolidated, updated version of the information package, accompanied by a detailed description of the changes, shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
2.   The revision shall be designated an ‘extension’ if, in addition to the provisions of paragraph 1:
(a)
further inspections or fresh tests are required;
(b)
any information on the EC type-approval certificate, with the exception of its attachments, has changed;
(c)
new requirements under any of the regulatory acts applicable to the approved vehicle type enter into force.
In such cases, the approval authority shall issue a revised EC type-approval certificate denoted by an extension number, incremented in accordance with the number of successive extensions already granted.
The approval certificate shall show clearly the reason for the extension and the date of re-issue.
3.   Whenever amended pages or a consolidated, updated version are issued, the index to the information package attached to the approval certificate shall be amended accordingly to show the date of the most recent extension or revision, or the date of the most recent consolidation of the updated version.
4.   No amendment to the approval of a type of vehicle shall be required if the new requirements referred to in paragraph 2(c) are, from a technical point of view, irrelevant to that type of vehicle or concern categories of vehicle other than the category to which it belongs.
