Article 13
General provisions
1.   The manufacturer shall inform without delay the Member State that granted the EC type-approval of any change in the particulars recorded in the information package. That Member State shall decide, in accordance with the rules laid down in this Chapter, which procedure is to be followed. Where necessary, the Member State may decide, in consultation with the manufacturer, that a new EC type-approval is to be granted.
2.   An application for the amendment of an EC type-approval shall be submitted exclusively to the Member State that granted the original EC type-approval.
3.   If the Member State finds that, for the purposes of making an amendment, fresh inspections or fresh tests are necessary, it shall inform the manufacturer accordingly. The procedures referred to in Articles 14 and 15 shall apply only after the requisite fresh inspections or fresh tests have been successfully carried out.
