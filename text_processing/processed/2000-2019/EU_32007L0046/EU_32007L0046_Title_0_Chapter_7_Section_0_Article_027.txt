Article 27
Registration, sale and entry into service of end-of-series vehicles
1.   Subject to the limits specified in Section B of Annex XII, and in respect only of a limited period of time, Member States may register and permit the sale or entry into service of vehicles conforming to a type of vehicle whose EC type-approval is no longer valid.
The first subparagraph shall apply only to vehicles within the territory of the Community which were covered by a valid EC type-approval at the time of their production, but which had not been registered or put into service before that EC type-approval lost its validity.
2.   The option provided for in paragraph 1 shall be available, in the case of complete vehicles, for a period of twelve months from the date on which validity of the EC type-approval expired and, in the case of completed vehicles, for a period of eighteen months from that date.
3.   A manufacturer who wishes to benefit from the provisions of paragraph 1 shall submit a request to the competent authority of each Member State concerned by the entry into service of the vehicles in question. The request must specify any technical or economic reasons preventing those vehicles from complying with the new technical requirements.
The Member States concerned shall decide, within three months of receiving such a request, whether and in what number to permit the registration of those vehicles within their territory.
4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to vehicles which were covered by a national type-approval but which had not been registered or put into service before that approval ceased to be valid, in application of Article 45, owing to the compulsory enforcement of the EC type-approval procedure.
5.   Member States shall apply appropriate measures to ensure that the number of vehicles to be registered or put into service in the framework of the procedure set out in this Article is effectively monitored.
