Article 10
Specific provisions concerning systems, components or separate technical units
1.   Member States shall grant an EC type-approval in respect of a system which conforms to the particulars in the information folder and which meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant separate directive or regulation, as prescribed in Annex IV or Annex XI.
2.   Member States shall grant a component or separate technical unit EC type-approval in respect of a component or separate technical unit which conforms to the particulars in the information folder and which meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant separate directive or regulation, as prescribed in Annex IV.
3.   Where components or separate technical units, whether or not intended for repair, servicing or maintenance, are also covered by a system type-approval with respect to a vehicle, no additional component or separate technical unit approval shall be required unless provided for under the relevant regulatory act.
4.   Where a component or separate technical unit fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle, thereby making it possible to verify compliance with the requirements only when the component or separate technical unit is operating in conjunction with those other vehicle parts, the scope of the EC type-approval of the component or the separate technical unit shall be restricted accordingly. In such cases, the EC type-approval certificate shall specify any restriction on its use and shall indicate the special conditions for its mounting. When such a component or separate technical unit is fitted by the vehicle manufacturer, compliance with any applicable restrictions on use or conditions for mounting shall be verified at the time when the vehicle is approved.
