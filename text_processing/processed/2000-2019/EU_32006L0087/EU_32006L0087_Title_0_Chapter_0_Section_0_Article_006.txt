Article 6
Dangerous goods
Any craft carrying a certificate issued pursuant to the Regulation for the transport of dangerous substances on the Rhine (the ‘ADNR’) may carry dangerous goods throughout the territory of the Community under the conditions stated in that certificate.
Any Member State may require that craft which do not carry such a certificate shall only be authorised to carry dangerous goods within its territory if the craft comply with requirements additional to those set out in this Directive. The Commission shall be notified of such requirements and shall inform the other Member States.
