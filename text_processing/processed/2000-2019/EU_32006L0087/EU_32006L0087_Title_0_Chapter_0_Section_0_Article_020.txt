Article 20
Adaptation of the annexes and recommendations on provisional certificates
1.   Any amendments which are necessary to adapt the annexes to this Directive to technical progress or to developments in this area arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that of the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR), to ensure that the two certificates referred to in Article 3(1)(a) are issued on the basis of technical requirements which guarantee an equivalent level of safety, or to take account of the cases referred to in Article 5, shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 19(2).
Those amendments shall be made rapidly in order to ensure that the technical requirements necessary for the issuing of the Community inland navigation certificate recognised for navigation on the Rhine give a level of safety equivalent to that required for the issuing of the certificate referred to in Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation.
2.   The Commission shall decide on recommendations from the Committee on the issuance of provisional Community inland navigation certificates in accordance with Article 2.19 of Annex II.
