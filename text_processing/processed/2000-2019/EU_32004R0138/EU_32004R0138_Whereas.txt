Whereas:
(1) The monitoring and evaluation of the common agricultural policy requires comparable, up-to-date and reliable information on the economic situation of agriculture, and more specifically on changes in agricultural income.
(2) Agricultural accounts are a basic tool for analysing the economic situation of a country's agriculture, provided that they are drawn up on the basis of a single set of principles. Agricultural accounts also make a valuable contribution to the calculation of the national accounts.
(3) The economic accounts for agriculture are compiled in accordance with the basic concepts and rules of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(2).
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(3) provides a reference framework for this Regulation.
(5) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the creation of common statistical standards which will allow the production of harmonised data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).
(7) The Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics and the Statistical Programme Committee have been informed,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
