Subject-matter and scope
1.   This Directive, which is the 20th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, lays down minimum requirements for the protection of workers from risks to their health and safety arising, or likely to arise, from exposure to electromagnetic fields during their work.
2.   This Directive covers all known direct biophysical effects and indirect effects caused by electromagnetic fields.

The Commission shall keep under review the latest scientific developments. If well-established scientific evidence on suggested long-term effects becomes available, the Commission shall consider a suitable policy response, including, if appropriate, the submission of a legislative proposal to address such effects. The Commission shall, through its report referred to in Article 15, keep the European Parliament and the Council informed in this regard.
