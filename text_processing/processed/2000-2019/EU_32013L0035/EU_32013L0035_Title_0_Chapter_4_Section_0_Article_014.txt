Article 14
Practical guides
In order to facilitate the implementation of this Directive the Commission shall make available non-binding practical guides at the latest six months before 1 July 2016. Those practical guides shall, in particular relate to the following issues:
(a)
the determination of exposure, taking into account appropriate European or international standards, including:
—
calculation methods for the assessment of the ELVs,
—
spatial averaging of external electric and magnetic fields,
—
guidance for dealing with measurements and calculations uncertainties;
(b)
guidance on demonstrating compliance in special types of non-uniform exposure in specific situations, based on well-established dosimetry;
(c)
the description of the ‘weighted peak method’ for the low frequency fields and of the ‘multifrequency fields summation’ for high frequency fields;
(d)
the conduct of the risk assessment and, wherever possible, the provision of simplified techniques, taking into account in particular the needs of SMEs;
(e)
measures aimed at avoiding or reducing risks, including specific prevention measures depending on the level of exposure and the workplace characteristics;
(f)
the establishment of documented working procedures, as well as specific information and training measures for workers exposed to electromagnetic fields during MRI-related activities falling under Article 10(1)(a);
(g)
the evaluation of exposures in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 MHz, where both thermal and non-thermal effects are to be considered;
(h)
the guidance on medical examinations and health surveillance to be provided by the employer in accordance with Article 8(2).
The Commission shall work in close cooperation with the Advisory Committee for Safety and Health at Work. The European Parliament shall be kept informed.
