Article 8
Health surveillance
1.   With the objective of the prevention and the early diagnosis of any adverse health effects due to exposure to electromagnetic fields, appropriate health surveillance shall be carried out in accordance with Article 14 of Directive 89/391/EEC. Health records and their availability shall be provided for in accordance with national law and/or practice.
2.   In accordance with national law and practice, the results of health surveillance shall be preserved in a suitable form that allows them to be consulted at a later date, subject to compliance with confidentiality requirements. Individual workers shall, at their request, have access to their own personal health records.
If any undesired or unexpected health effect is reported by a worker, or in any event where exposure above the ELVs is detected, the employer shall ensure that appropriate medical examinations or individual health surveillance is provided to the worker(s) concerned, in accordance with national law and practice.
Such examinations or surveillance shall be made available during hours chosen by the worker, and any costs arising shall not be borne by the worker.
