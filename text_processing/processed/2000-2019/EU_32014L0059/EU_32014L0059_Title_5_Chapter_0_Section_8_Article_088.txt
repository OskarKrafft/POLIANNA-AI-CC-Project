3.   The resolution authorities of third countries where a parent undertaking or an institution established in the Union has a subsidiary institution or a branch that would be considered to be significant were it located in the Union may, at their request, be invited to participate in the resolution college as observers, provided that they are subject to confidentiality requirements equivalent, in the opinion of the group-level resolution authority, to those established by Article 98.
4.   EBA shall contribute to promoting and monitoring the efficient, effective and consistent functioning of resolution colleges, taking into account international standards. EBA shall be invited to attend the meetings of the resolution college for that purpose. EBA shall not have any voting rights to the extent that any voting takes place within the framework of resolution colleges.

convene and chair all its meetings and keep all members of the resolution college fully informed in advance of the organisation of meetings of the resolution college, of the main issues to be discussed and of the items to be considered;
(d)
notify the members of the resolution college of any planned meetings so that they can request to participate;
(e)
decide which members and observers shall be invited to attend particular meetings of the resolution college, on the basis of specific needs, taking into account the relevance of the issue to be discussed for those members and observers, in particular the potential impact on financial stability in the Member States concerned;
(f)
keep all of the members of the college informed, in a timely manner, of the decisions and outcomes of those meetings.
The members participating in the resolution college shall cooperate closely.
Notwithstanding point (e), resolution authorities shall be entitled to participate in resolution college meetings whenever matters subject to joint decision-making or relating to a group entity located in their Member State are on the agenda.
6.   Group-level resolution authorities are not obliged to establish a resolution college if other groups or colleges perform the same functions and carry out the same tasks specified in this Article and comply with all the conditions and procedures, including those covering membership and participation in resolution colleges, established in this Article and in Article 90. In such a case, all references to resolution colleges in this Directive shall also be understood as references to those other groups or colleges.
7.   EBA shall, taking into account international standards, develop draft regulatory standards in order to specify the operational functioning of the resolution colleges for the performance of the tasks referred to in paragraph 1.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
