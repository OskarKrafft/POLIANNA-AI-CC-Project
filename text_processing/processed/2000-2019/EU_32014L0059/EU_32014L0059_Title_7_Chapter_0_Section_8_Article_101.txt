Article 101
Use of the resolution financing arrangements
1.   The financing arrangements established in accordance with Article 100 may be used by the resolution authority only to the extent necessary to ensure the effective application of the resolution tools, for the following purposes:
(a)
to guarantee the assets or the liabilities of the institution under resolution, its subsidiaries, a bridge institution or an asset management vehicle;
(b)
to make loans to the institution under resolution, its subsidiaries, a bridge institution or an asset management vehicle;
(c)
to purchase assets of the institution under resolution;
(d)
to make contributions to a bridge institution and an asset management vehicle;
(e)
to pay compensation to shareholders or creditors in accordance with Article 75;
(f)
to make a contribution to the institution under resolution in lieu of the write down or conversion of liabilities of certain creditors, when the bail-in tool is applied and the resolution authority decides to exclude certain creditors from the scope of bail-in in accordance with Article 44(3) to (8);
(g)
to lend to other financing arrangements on a voluntary basis in accordance with Article 106;
(h)
to take any combination of the actions referred to in points (a) to (g).
The financing arrangements may be used to take the actions referred to in the first subparagraph also with respect to the purchaser in the context of the sale of business tool.
2.   The resolution financing arrangement shall not be used directly to absorb the losses of an institution or an entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) or to recapitalise such an institution or an entity. In the event that the use of the resolution financing arrangement for the purposes in paragraph 1 of this Article indirectly results in part of the losses of an institution or an entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) being passed on to the resolution financing arrangement, the principles governing the use of the resolution financing arrangement set out in Article 44 shall apply.
