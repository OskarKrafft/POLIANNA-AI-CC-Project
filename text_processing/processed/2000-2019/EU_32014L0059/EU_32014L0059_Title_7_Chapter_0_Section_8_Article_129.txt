By 1 June 2018, the Commission shall review the implementation of this Directive and shall submit a report thereon to the European Parliament and to the Council. It shall assess in particular the following:
(a)
on the basis of the report from EBA referred to in Article 4(7), the need for any amendments with regard to minimising divergences at national level;
(b)

the functioning and efficiency of the role conferred on EBA in this Directive, including carrying out of mediation.
Where appropriate, that report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
Notwithstanding the review provided for in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall, by 3 July 2017, specifically review the application of Articles 13, 18 and 45 as regards EBAâ€™s powers to conduct binding mediation to take account of future developments in financial services law.
