Article 33
Conditions for resolution with regard to financial institutions and holding companies
1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may take a resolution action in relation to a financial institution referred to in point (b) of Article 1(1), when the conditions laid down in Article 32(1), are met with regard to both the financial institution and with regard to the parent undertaking subject to consolidated supervision.
2.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may take a resolution action in relation to an entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1), when the conditions laid down in Article 32(1) are met with regard to both the entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) and with regard to one or more subsidiaries which are institutions or, where the subsidiary is not established in the Union, the third-country authority has determined that it meets the conditions for resolution under the law of that third country.
3.   Where the subsidiary institutions of a mixed-activity holding company are held directly or indirectly by an intermediate financial holding company, Member States shall ensure that resolution actions for the purposes of group resolution are taken in relation to the intermediate financial holding company, and shall not take resolution actions for the purposes of group resolution in relation to the mixed-activity holding company.
4.   Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, notwithstanding the fact that an entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) does not meet the conditions established in Article 32(1), resolution authorities may take resolution action with regard to an entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) when one or more of the subsidiaries which are institutions comply with the conditions established in Article 32(1), (4) and (5) and their assets and liabilities are such that their failure threatens an institution or the group as a whole or the insolvency law of the Member State requires that groups be treated as a whole and resolution action with regard to the entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) is necessary for the resolution of such subsidiaries which are institutions or for the resolution of the group as a whole.
For the purposes of paragraph 2 and of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, when assessing whether the conditions in Article 32(1) are met in respect of one or more subsidiaries which are institutions, the resolution authority of the institution and the resolution authority of the entity referred to in point (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) may by way of joint agreement disregard any intra-group capital or loss transfers between the entities, including the exercise of write down or conversion powers.
