Article 23
Conditions for group financial support
1.   Financial support by a group entity in accordance with Article 19 may only be provided if all the following conditions are met:
(a)
there is a reasonable prospect that the support provided significantly redresses the financial difficulties of the group entity receiving the support;

the financial support is provided on terms, including consideration in accordance with Article 19(7);
(d)
there is a reasonable prospect, on the basis of the information available to the management body of the group entity providing financial support at the time when the decision to grant financial support is taken, that the consideration for the support will be paid and, if the support is given in the form of a loan, that the loan will be reimbursed, by the group entity receiving the support. If the support is given in the form of a guarantee or any form of security, the same condition shall apply to the liability arising for the recipient if the guarantee or the security is enforced;
