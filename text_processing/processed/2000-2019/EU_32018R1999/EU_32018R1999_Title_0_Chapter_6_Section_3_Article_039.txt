Article 39
Union and national systems for policies and measures and projections
1.   By 1 January 2021, Member States and the Commission shall operate and seek to continuously improve national and Union systems respectively, for reporting on policies and measures and for reporting on projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks. Those systems shall include the relevant institutional, legal and procedural arrangements established within a Member State and the Union for evaluating policy and making projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks.
2.   Member States and the Commission shall aim to ensure the timeliness, transparency, accuracy, consistency, comparability and completeness of the information reported on policies and measures and projections of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, as referred to in Article 18, including the use and application of data, methods and models, and the implementation of quality assurance and quality control activities and sensitivity analysis.
3.   The Commission, assisted by the Climate Change Committee referred to in point (a) of Article 44(1), shall adopt implementing acts to set out the structure, format and submission process of information on national and Union systems for policies and measures and projections pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article and to Article 18.
In proposing such implementing acts, the Commission shall take into account the relevant decisions adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or of the Paris Agreement, including internationally agreed reporting requirements as well as timetables for monitoring and reporting of that information.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(6).
