1.   With a view to monitoring Member States' greenhouse gas emission reductions or limitations pursuant to Articles 4, 9 and 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 and their reduction of emissions and enhancement of removals by sinks pursuant to Articles 4 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 and any other greenhouse gas emission reduction or limitation targets set out in Union law, the Commission shall, in 2027 and 2032, carry out a comprehensive review of the national inventory data submitted by Member States pursuant to Article 26(4) of this Regulation. Member States shall participate fully in that process.
2.   The comprehensive review referred to in paragraph 1 shall include:
(a)
checks to verify the transparency, accuracy, consistency, comparability and completeness of information submitted;
(b)
checks to identify cases where inventory data are prepared in a manner which is inconsistent with UNFCCC guidance documentation or Union rules;
(c)
checks to identify cases where LULUCF accounting is carried out in a manner which is inconsistent with UNFCCC guidance documentation or Union rules, and
(d)
where appropriate, calculating the resulting technical corrections necessary, in consultation with the Member States.
3.   The Commission, assisted by the Climate Change Committee referred to in point (a) of Article 44(1), shall adopt implementing acts to determine the timing and the procedure for carrying out the comprehensive review, including the tasks set out in paragraph 2 of this Article, and ensuring due consultation of the Member States with regard to the conclusions of the reviews.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 44(6).
4.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, determine the total sum of emissions for the relevant years arising from the corrected inventory data for each Member State upon completion of the review split between emission data relevant for Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 and emission data referred to in point (c) of Part 1 of Annex V to this Regulation and also determine the total sum of emissions and removals relevant for Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841.
5.   The data for each Member State as recorded in the registries set up pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 four months following the date of publication of an implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, shall be used for the compliance check with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841, including changes to such data arising as a result of that Member State making use of the flexibilities pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841.
6.   The data for each Member State as recorded in the registries set up pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 two months following the compliance check date with Regulation (EU) 2018/841 referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, shall be used for the compliance check pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 for the years 2021 and 2026. The compliance check pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 for each of the years 2022 to 2025 and 2027 to 2030 shall be performed at a date falling one month following the date of the compliance check for the previous year. This check shall include changes to such data arising as a result of that Member State making use of the flexibilities pursuant to Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842.
