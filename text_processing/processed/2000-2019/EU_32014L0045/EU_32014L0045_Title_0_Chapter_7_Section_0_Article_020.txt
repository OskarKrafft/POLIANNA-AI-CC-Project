Article 20
Reporting
1.   By 30 April 2020, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation and effects of this Directive, in particular as regards the level of harmonisation of periodic roadworthiness tests, the effectiveness of the provisions on its scope, the frequency of testing, the mutual recognition of roadworthiness certificates in cases of re-registration of vehicles originating from another Member State and the results of the examination concerning the feasibility of introducing an electronic vehicle information platform as referred to in Article 16. The report shall also analyse whether there is a need to update the Annexes, particularly in the light of technical progress and practices. The report shall be submitted after the consultation of the committee referred to in Article 19 and shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals.
2.   No later than 30 April 2019, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report, based on independent studies, on the effectiveness of the inclusion of light trailers and two- or three-wheel vehicles in the scope of this Directive. The report shall assess the evolution of the road safety situation in the Union and, for each subcategory of L-vehicles, compare the results of national road safety measures, taking into account the average distance travelled by those vehicles. In particular, the Commission shall assess whether the standards and costs of periodic roadworthiness testing of each category of vehicle is proportionate to the road safety objectives set. The report shall be accompanied by a detailed impact assessment analysing the costs and benefits throughout the Union, including the specificities of Member States. The report shall be made available at least six months prior to the submission of any legislative proposal, if appropriate, to include new categories within the scope of this Directive.
