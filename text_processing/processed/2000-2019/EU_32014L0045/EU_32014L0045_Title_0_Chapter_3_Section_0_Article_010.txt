Article 10
Proof of test
1.   The testing centre or, if relevant, the competent authority of the Member State that has carried out a roadworthiness test on a vehicle registered in its territory shall provide a proof, such as an indication on the vehicle registration document, a sticker, a certificate or any other easily accessible information, for each vehicle which has passed such a test. The proof shall indicate the date by which the next roadworthiness test is to take place.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission a description of that proof before 20 May 2018. The Commission shall in turn inform the Committee referred to in Article 19.
2.   Where the tested vehicle belongs to a vehicle category which is not subject to registration in the Member State where it has been put into service, that Member State may require the proof of test to be displayed in a visible manner on that vehicle.
3.   For the purpose of free circulation, each Member State shall recognise the proof provided by a testing centre or competent authority of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 1.
