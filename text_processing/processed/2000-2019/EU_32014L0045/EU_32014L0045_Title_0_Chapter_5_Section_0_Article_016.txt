Article 16
Electronic vehicle information platform
The Commission shall examine the feasibility, costs and benefits of establishing an electronic vehicle information platform by taking advantage of existing and already implemented IT solutions with regard to international data exchange so as to minimise costs and avoid duplication. In examining the matter, the Commission shall consider the most appropriate way to link the existing national systems with a view to facilitating exchanges of information on data relating to roadworthiness testing and odometer readings between the competent authorities of Member States responsible for testing, registration and vehicle approval, testing centres, test equipment manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers.
The Commission shall also examine the feasibility, costs and benefits of collecting and storing available information concerning the main safety-related components of vehicles which have been involved in serious accidents as well as the possibility of making information on accident history and odometer readings available in an anonymised form to inspectors, holders of registration certificates and accident researchers.
