Article 7
Assessment of deficiencies
1.   For each item to be tested, Annex I provides a minimum list of possible deficiencies and their level of severity.
2.   Deficiencies that are found during periodic testings of vehicles shall be categorised in one of the following groups:
(a)
minor deficiencies having no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or impact on the environment, and other minor non-compliances;
(b)
major deficiencies that may prejudice the safety of the vehicle or have an impact on the environment or put other road users at risk, or other more significant non-compliances;
(c)
dangerous deficiencies constituting a direct and immediate risk to road safety or having an impact on the environment which justify that a Member State or its competent authorities may prohibit the use of the vehicle on public roads.
3.   A vehicle having deficiencies falling into more than one of the deficiency groups referred to in paragraph 2 shall be classified in the group corresponding to the more serious deficiency. A vehicle showing several deficiencies within the same inspection area as identified in the scope of the test referred to in point 2 of Annex I, may be classified in the next most serious deficiency group if it can be demonstrated that the combined effect of those deficiencies results in a higher risk to road safety.
