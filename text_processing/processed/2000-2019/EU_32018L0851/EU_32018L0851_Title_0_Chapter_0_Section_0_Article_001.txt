‘Article 11a
Rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets
1.   For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained:
(a)
Member States shall calculate the weight of the municipal waste generated and prepared for re-use or recycled in a given calendar year;
(b)
the weight of the municipal waste prepared for re-use shall be calculated as the weight of products or components of products that have become municipal waste and have undergone all necessary checking, cleaning or repairing operations to enable re-use without further sorting or pre-processing;
(c)
the weight of the municipal waste recycled shall be calculated as the weight of waste which, having undergone all necessary checking, sorting and other preliminary operations to remove waste materials that are not targeted by the subsequent reprocessing and to ensure high-quality recycling, enters the recycling operation whereby waste materials are actually reprocessed into products, materials or substances.
2.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, the weight of the municipal waste recycled shall be measured when the waste enters the recycling operation.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the weight of municipal waste recycled may be measured at the output of any sorting operation provided that:
(a)
such output waste is subsequently recycled;
(b)
the weight of materials or substances that are removed by further operations preceding the recycling operation and are not subsequently recycled is not included in the weight of waste reported as recycled.
3.   Member States shall establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of municipal waste to ensure that the conditions laid down in point (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article and in paragraph 2 of this Article are met. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data gathered on recycled waste, the system may consist of electronic registries set up pursuant to Article 35(4), technical specifications for the quality requirements of sorted waste, or average loss rates for sorted waste for various waste types and waste management practices respectively. Average loss rates shall only be used in cases where reliable data cannot be obtained otherwise and shall be calculated on the basis of the calculation rules established in the delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 10 of this Article.
4.   For the purpose of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, the amount of municipal biodegradable waste that enters aerobic or anaerobic treatment may be counted as recycled where that treatment generates compost, digestate, or other output with a similar quantity of recycled content in relation to input, which is to be used as a recycled product, material or substance. Where the output is used on land, Member States may count it as recycled only if this use results in benefits to agriculture or ecological improvement.
As from 1 January 2027, Member States may count municipal bio-waste entering aerobic or anaerobic treatment as recycled only if, in accordance with Article 22, it has been separately collected or separated at source.
5.   For the purposes of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, the amount of waste materials that have ceased to be waste as a result of a preparatory operation before being reprocessed may be counted as recycled provided that such materials are destined for subsequent reprocessing into products, materials or substances to be used for the original or other purposes. However, end-of-waste materials to be used as fuels or other means to generate energy, or to be incinerated, backfilled or landfilled, shall not be counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets.
6.   For the purposes of calculating whether the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) have been attained, Member States may take into account the recycling of metals separated after incineration of municipal waste provided that the recycled metals meet certain quality criteria laid down in the implementing act adopted pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article.
7.   Waste sent to another Member State for the purposes of preparing for re-use, recycling or backfilling in that other Member State may only be counted towards the attainment of the targets laid down in Article 11(2) and (3) by the Member State in which that waste was collected.
8.   Waste exported from the Union for preparing for re-use or recycling shall count towards the attainment of the targets laid down in Article 11(2) and (3) of this Directive by the Member State in which it was collected only if the requirements of paragraph 3 of this Article are met and if, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, the exporter can prove that the shipment of waste complies with the requirements of that Regulation and that the treatment of waste outside the Union took place in conditions that are broadly equivalent to the requirements of the relevant Union environmental law.
9.   In order to ensure uniform conditions for the application of this Article, the Commission shall adopt by 31 March 2019 implementing acts establishing rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data, in particular as regards:
(a)
a common methodology for the calculation of the weight of metals that have been recycled in accordance with paragraph 6, including quality criteria for the recycled metals, and
(b)
bio-waste separated and recycled at source.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2).
10.   By 31 March 2019, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 38a in order to supplement this Directive by establishing rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of the weight of materials or substances which are removed after a sorting operation and which are not subsequently recycled, based on average loss rates for sorted waste.
Article 11b
Early warning report
1.   The Commission shall, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, draw up reports on the progress towards the attainment of the targets laid down in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 11(2) and in Article 11(3) at the latest three years before each deadline laid down therein.
