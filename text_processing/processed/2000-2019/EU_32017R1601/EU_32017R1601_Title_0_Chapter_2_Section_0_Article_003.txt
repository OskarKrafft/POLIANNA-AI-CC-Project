Article 3
Purpose
1.   The purpose of the EFSD as an integrated financial package, supplying financing capacity in the form of grants, guarantees and other financial instruments to eligible counterparts, shall be to support investments and increased access to financing, primarily in Africa and the European Neighbourhood, in order to foster sustainable and inclusive economic and social development and promote the socioeconomic resilience of partner countries, including, where appropriate, in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the New Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration, with a particular focus on sustainable and inclusive growth, on the creation of decent jobs, on gender equality and the empowerment of women and young people, and on socioeconomic sectors and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, while maximising additionality, delivering innovative products and crowding in private sector funds.
2.   The EFSD shall be guided by the objectives of the Union’s external action as set out in Article 21 TEU and of Union policy in the field of development cooperation as set out in Article 208 TFEU and the internationally agreed development effectiveness principles. The EFSD shall contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, in particular poverty eradication, and, where appropriate, to the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy, thus addressing specific socioeconomic root causes of migration and fostering sustainable reintegration of migrants returning to their countries of origin, and strengthening transit and host communities.
3.   The EFSD shall contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement by also targeting investments to sectors that advance climate change mitigation and adaptation.
4.   The EFSD shall be consistent with the objectives set out in the external financing instruments established by Regulations (EU) No 232/2014, (EU) No 233/2014 and (EU) 2015/323 and with the priorities contained in national or regional programmes and strategy papers, where available.
