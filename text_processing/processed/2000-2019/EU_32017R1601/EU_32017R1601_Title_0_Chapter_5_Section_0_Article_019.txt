Article 19
Grievance and redress mechanism
In view of possible grievances of third parties in partner countries, including communities and individuals affected by projects supported by the EFSD Guarantee, the Commission and European Union delegations shall publish on their websites direct references to the complaints mechanisms of the relevant counterparts that have concluded agreements with the Commission. The Commission shall also provide the possibility of directly receiving complaints related to the treatment of grievances by eligible counterparts. The Commission shall take that information into account in view of future cooperation with those counterparts.
