Article 22
Excluded activities and non-cooperative jurisdictions
1.   In their financing and investment operations, the eligible counterparts shall comply with applicable Union law and agreed international and Union standards and, therefore, shall not support projects under this Regulation that contribute to money laundering, terrorism financing, tax avoidance, tax fraud and tax evasion.
In addition, the eligible counterparts shall not enter into new or renewed operations with entities incorporated or established in jurisdictions listed under the relevant Union policy on non-cooperative jurisdictions, or that are identified as high risk third countries pursuant to Article 9(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), or that do not effectively comply with Union or internationally agreed tax standards on transparency and exchange of information. The eligible counterparts may derogate from this principle only if the project is physically implemented in one of those jurisdictions, and does not present any indication that the relevant operation falls under any of the categories listed in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
When concluding agreements with financial intermediaries, the eligible counterparts shall transpose the requirements referred to in this Article into the relevant agreements and shall request the financial intermediaries to report on their observance.
2.   In its financing and investment operations, the eligible counterpart shall apply the principles and standards set out in Union law on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing and in particular Regulation (EU) 2015/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and Directive (EU) 2015/849. The eligible counterparts shall make both direct funding and funding via intermediaries under this Regulation contingent upon the disclosure of beneficial ownership information in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 and publish country-by-country reporting data in accordance with Article 89(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (15).
