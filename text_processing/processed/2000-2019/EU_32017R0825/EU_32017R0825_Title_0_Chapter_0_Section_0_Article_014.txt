ensure complementarity and synergy between different instruments at Union, national and, where appropriate, regional level, in particular in relation to measures financed by Union funds, both in the planning phase and during implementation;
(b)
optimise mechanisms for coordination to avoid duplication of effort; and
(c)
ensure close cooperation between those responsible for implementation at Union, national and, where appropriate, regional level to deliver coherent and streamlined support actions.
2.   The Commission shall make its best efforts to ensure complementarity and synergies with support provided by other relevant international organisations.
3.   The relevant annual work programmes may serve as the coordination framework, where support is envisaged in any of the areas referred to in Article 5(2).
