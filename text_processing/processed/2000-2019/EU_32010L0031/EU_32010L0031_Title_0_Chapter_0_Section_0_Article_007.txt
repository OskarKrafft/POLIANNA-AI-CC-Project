Article 7
Existing buildings
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that when buildings undergo major renovation, the energy performance of the building or the renovated part thereof is upgraded in order to meet minimum energy performance requirements set in accordance with Article 4 in so far as this is technically, functionally and economically feasible.
Those requirements shall be applied to the renovated building or building unit as a whole. Additionally or alternatively, requirements may be applied to the renovated building elements.
Member States shall in addition take the necessary measures to ensure that when a building element that forms part of the building envelope and has a significant impact on the energy performance of the building envelope, is retrofitted or replaced, the energy performance of the building element meets minimum energy performance requirements in so far as this is technically, functionally and economically feasible.
Member States shall determine these minimum energy performance requirements in accordance with Article 4.
Member States shall encourage, in relation to buildings undergoing major renovation, the consideration and taking into account of high-efficiency alternative systems, as referred to in Article 6(1), in so far as this is technically, functionally and economically feasible.
