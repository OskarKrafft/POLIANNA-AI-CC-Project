Article 6
New buildings
1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that new buildings meet the minimum energy performance requirements set in accordance with Article 4.
For new buildings, Member States shall ensure that, before construction starts, the technical, environmental and economic feasibility of high-efficiency alternative systems such as those listed below, if available, is considered and taken into account:
(a)
decentralised energy supply systems based on energy from renewable sources;
(b)
cogeneration;
(c)
district or block heating or cooling, particularly where it is based entirely or partially on energy from renewable sources;
(d)
heat pumps.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the analysis of alternative systems referred to in paragraph 1 is documented and available for verification purposes.
3.   That analysis of alternative systems may be carried out for individual buildings or for groups of similar buildings or for common typologies of buildings in the same area. As far as collective heating and cooling systems are concerned, the analysis may be carried out for all buildings connected to the system in the same area.
