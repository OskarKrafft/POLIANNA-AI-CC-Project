Article 1
Subject matter
1.   This Directive promotes the improvement of the energy performance of buildings within the Union, taking into account outdoor climatic and local conditions, as well as indoor climate requirements and cost-effectiveness.
2.   This Directive lays down requirements as regards:
(a)
the common general framework for a methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings and building units;
(b)
the application of minimum requirements to the energy performance of new buildings and new building units;
(c)
the application of minimum requirements to the energy performance of:
(i)
existing buildings, building units and building elements that are subject to major renovation;
(ii)
building elements that form part of the building envelope and that have a significant impact on the energy performance of the building envelope when they are retrofitted or replaced; and
(iii)
technical building systems whenever they are installed, replaced or upgraded;
(d)
national plans for increasing the number of nearly zero-energy buildings;
(e)
energy certification of buildings or building units;
(f)
regular inspection of heating and air-conditioning systems in buildings; and
(g)
independent control systems for energy performance certificates and inspection reports.
3.   The requirements laid down in this Directive are minimum requirements and shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent measures. Such measures shall be compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. They shall be notified to the Commission.
