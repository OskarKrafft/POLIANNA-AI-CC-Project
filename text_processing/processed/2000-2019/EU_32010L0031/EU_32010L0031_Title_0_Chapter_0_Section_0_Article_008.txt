Article 8
Technical building systems
1.   Member States shall, for the purpose of optimising the energy use of technical building systems, set system requirements in respect of the overall energy performance, the proper installation, and the appropriate dimensioning, adjustment and control of the technical building systems which are installed in existing buildings. Member States may also apply these system requirements to new buildings.
System requirements shall be set for new, replacement and upgrading of technical building systems and shall be applied in so far as they are technically, economically and functionally feasible.
The system requirements shall cover at least the following:
(a)
heating systems;
(b)
hot water systems;
(c)
air-conditioning systems;
(d)
large ventilation systems;
or a combination of such systems.
2.   Member States shall encourage the introduction of intelligent metering systems whenever a building is constructed or undergoes major renovation, whilst ensuring that this encouragement is in line with point 2 of Annex I to Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity (16). Member States may furthermore encourage, where appropriate, the installation of active control systems such as automation, control and monitoring systems that aim to save energy.
