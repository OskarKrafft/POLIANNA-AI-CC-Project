Article 28
Transposition
1.   Member States shall adopt and publish, by 9 July 2012 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Articles 2 to 18, and with Articles 20 and 27.
They shall apply those provisions as far as Articles 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20 and 27 are concerned, from 9 January 2013 at the latest.
They shall apply those provisions as far as Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15 and 16 are concerned, to buildings occupied by the public authorities from 9 January 2013 at the latest and to other buildings from 9 July 2013 at the latest.
They may defer the application of Article 12(1) and (2) to single building units that are rented out, until 31 December 2015. This shall however not result in fewer certificates being issued than would have been the case under the application of the Directive 2002/91/EC in the Member State concerned.
When Member States adopt measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. They shall also include a statement that references in existing laws, regulations and administrative provisions to Directive 2002/91/EC shall be construed as references to this Directive. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made and how that statement is to be formulated.
2.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
