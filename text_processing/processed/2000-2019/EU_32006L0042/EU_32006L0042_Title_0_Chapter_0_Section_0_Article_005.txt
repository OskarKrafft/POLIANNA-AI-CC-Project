Article 5
Placing on the market and putting into service
1.   Before placing machinery on the market and/or putting it into service, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall:
(a)
ensure that it satisfies the relevant essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex I;
(b)
ensure that the technical file referred to in Annex VII, part A is available;
(c)
provide, in particular, the necessary information, such as instructions;
(d)
carry out the appropriate procedures for assessing conformity in accordance with Article 12;
(e)
draw up the EC declaration of conformity in accordance with Annex II, part 1, Section A and ensure that it accompanies the machinery;
(f)
affix the CE marking in accordance with Article 16.
2.   Before placing partly completed machinery on the market, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall ensure that the procedure referred to in Article 13 has been completed.
3.   For the purposes of the procedures referred to in Article 12, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall have, or shall have access to, the necessary means of ensuring that the machinery satisfies the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex I.
4.   Where machinery is also the subject of other Directives relating to other aspects and providing for the affixing of the CE marking, the marking shall indicate that the machinery also conforms to the provisions of those other Directives.
However, where one or more of those Directives allow the manufacturer or his authorised representative to choose, during a transitional period, the system to be applied, the CE marking shall indicate conformity only to the provisions of those Directives applied by the manufacturer or his authorised representative. Particulars of the Directives applied, as published in the Official Journal of the European Union, shall be given on the EC declaration of conformity.
