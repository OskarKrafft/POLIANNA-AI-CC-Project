Article 43
Making available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles
Without prejudice to Articles 46 and 47, vehicles for which EU whole-vehicle type-approval is mandatory or for which the manufacturer has obtained such type-approval under this Regulation shall only be made available on the market, registered or enter into service if they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued in accordance with Article 38.
Where such vehicles are incomplete, making available on the market or entry into service of such vehicles is permitted, but the authorities responsible for vehicle registration of the Member States may refuse to allow the registration and use on the road of such vehicles.
