Article 69
Challenge to the competence of technical services
1.   The Commission shall investigate all cases where it has doubts, or doubt is brought to its attention, regarding the competence of a technical service or the continued fulfilment by a technical service of the requirements and responsibilities to which it is subject.
2.   The Member State of the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all information relating to the basis for the designation or the maintenance of the designation of the technical service concerned.
3.   The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its investigations is treated confidentially.
4.   Where the Commission ascertains that a technical service does not meet or no longer meets the requirements for its designation, it shall inform the Member State of the designating approval authority accordingly, with a view to establishing, in cooperation with that Member State, the corrective measures necessary, and shall request that Member State to take those corrective measures, including the withdrawal of the designation if necessary.
