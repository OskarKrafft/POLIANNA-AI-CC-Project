Article 13
Obligations of importers concerning their products that are not in conformity or that present a serious risk
1.   Importers who consider or have reason to believe that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate.
2.   Where a vehicle, system, component, separate technical unit, part or equipment presents a serious risk, importers shall immediately inform the manufacturer and the approval and market surveillance authorities of the Member States in which they have placed it on the market. The importer shall also inform them of any action taken and give details, in particular, of the serious risk and any corrective measures taken by the manufacturer.
3.   Importers shall, for a period of 10 years after the placing on the market of the vehicle and for a period of five years as from the placing on the market for a system, component or separate technical unit, keep a copy of the certificate of conformity at the disposal of the approval and market surveillance authorities and ensure that the information package as referred to in Article 29(10) can be made available to those authorities, upon request.
4.   Importers shall, following a reasoned request from a national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit in a language which can be easily understood by that authority. Importers shall cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by a vehicle, system, component, separate technical unit, part or equipment which they have placed on the market.
