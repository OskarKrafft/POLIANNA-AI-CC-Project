Article 47
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, during the procedure set out in Article 46(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to the Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay evaluate the national measure after consulting Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2), whether the national measure is considered justified or not.
The Commission shall communicate its decision to all Member States and to the relevant economic operator or operators.
2.   If the national measure is considered justified by the Commission, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw or adapt the measure, in accordance with the decision referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and is attributed to shortcomings in this Regulation or in delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation, the Commission shall propose appropriate measures as follows:
(a)
where delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary amendments to the act concerned;
(b)
where UNECE regulations are concerned, the Commission shall propose the necessary draft amendments to the relevant UNECE regulations in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.
