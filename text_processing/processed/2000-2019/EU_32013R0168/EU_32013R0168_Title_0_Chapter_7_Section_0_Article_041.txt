Article 41
Subsequent adaptation of delegated and implementing acts
1.   Where the Commission authorises the granting of an exemption pursuant to Article 40, it shall immediately take the necessary steps to adapt the delegated or implementing acts concerned to technological developments.
Where the exemption under Article 40 relates to a UNECE regulation, the Commission shall propose an amendment to the relevant UNECE regulation in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.
2.   As soon as the relevant acts have been amended, any restriction in the Commission decision authorising the exemption shall be lifted.
If the necessary steps to adapt the delegated or implementing acts have not been taken, the Commission may, at the request of the Member State which granted the approval, authorise, by means of a decision in the form of an implementing act adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(2), the Member State to extend the type-approval.
