(a)
propelled with an internal combustion engine:
—
compression ignition (CI),
—
positive ignition (PI);
(b)
propelled with an external combustion engine, a turbine or a rotary piston engine, whereby, for the purpose of complying with environmental and functional safety requirements, a vehicle equipped with such a propulsion is considered the same as a vehicle propelled with a PI internal combustion engine;
(c)
propelled by an engine that runs on pre-compressed air and does not emit higher levels of pollutants and/or inert gases than the levels present in ambient air, whereby, with regard to functional safety requirements and fuel storage and supply, such a vehicle is considered to be a vehicle operated on gaseous fuel;
(d)
propelled with an electric engine;
(e)
a hybrid vehicle that combines any propulsion configuration referred to in points (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this paragraph or any multiple combination of these propulsion configurations including multiple combustion and/or electric engines.
4.   As regards the classification of L-category vehicles in paragraph 2, a vehicle that does not come under a certain category because it exceeds at least one of the criteria stipulated for that category falls into the next category whose criteria it meets. This applies to the following groups of categories and subcategories:

category L1e with its subcategories L1e-A and L1e-B and category L3e with its subcategories L3e-A1, L3e-A2 and L3e-A3;
(b)
category L2e and category L5e with its subcategories L5e-A and L5e-B;
(c)
category L6e with its subcategories L6e-A and L6e-B and category L7e with its subcategories L7e-A, L7e-B and L7e-C;
(d)
any other logical sequence of categories and/or subcategories proposed by the manufacturer and approved by the approval authority.
5.   Notwithstanding the (sub-)classification criteria set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article and in Annex I, additional subcategories shall apply as set out in Annex V, in order to harmonise environmental test procedures at the international level by referring to UNECE regulations and UNECE global technical regulations.
