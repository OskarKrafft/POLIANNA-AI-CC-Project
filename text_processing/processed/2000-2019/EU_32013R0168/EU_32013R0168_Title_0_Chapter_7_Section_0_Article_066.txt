Article 66
Assessment of the skills of technical services
1.   The designating approval authority shall draw up an assessment report demonstrating that the candidate technical service has been assessed for its compliance with the requirements of this Regulation and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation. That report may include a certificate of accreditation issued by an accreditation body.
2.   The assessment on which the report referred to in paragraph 1 is based shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions laid down in a delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 65. The assessment report shall be reviewed at least every three years.
3.   The assessment report shall be communicated to the Commission upon request. In such cases, and where the assessment is not based on an accreditation certificate issued by a national accreditation body attesting that the technical service fulfils the requirements of this Regulation, the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission with documentary evidence which attests the technical service’s competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that the technical service is monitored regularly by the designating approval authority and satisfies the requirements of this Regulation and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.
The approval authority that intends to be designated as a technical service in accordance with Article 63(2) shall document compliance through an assessment conducted by auditors independent of the activity being assessed. Such auditors may be from the same organisation provided that they are managed separately from personnel undertaking the assessed activity.
4.   An accredited in-house technical service shall comply with the relevant provisions of this Article.
