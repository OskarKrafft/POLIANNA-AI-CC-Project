Article 5
Mass in running order determination
1.   The mass in running order of an L-category vehicle shall be determined by measuring the mass of the unladen vehicle ready for normal use and shall include the mass of:
(a)
liquids;
(b)
standard equipment in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications;
(c)
‘fuel’ in the fuel tanks that shall be filled to at least 90 % of their capacities.
For the purposes of this point:
(i)
if a vehicle is propelled with a ‘liquid fuel’ this shall be considered as ‘fuel’;
(ii)
if a vehicle is propelled with a liquid ‘fuel/oil mixture’:
—
if fuel to propel the vehicle and lubrication oil are pre-mixed then this ‘pre-mixture’ shall be considered as ‘fuel’,
—
if fuel to propel the vehicle and lubrication oil are stored separately then only ‘fuel’ propelling the vehicle shall be considered as ‘fuel’; or
(iii)
if a vehicle is propelled by a gaseous fuel, a liquefied gaseous fuel or is running on compressed air, the mass of ‘fuel’ in the gaseous fuel tanks may be set to 0 kg;
(d)
the bodywork, the cabin, the doors; and
(e)
the glazing, the coupling, the spare wheels as well as the tools.
2.   The mass in running order of an L-category vehicle shall exclude the mass of:
(a)
the driver (75 kg) and passenger (65 kg);
(b)
the machines or equipment installed on the load platform area;
(c)
in the case of a hybrid or pure electric vehicle, the propulsion batteries;
(d)
in the case of mono-fuel, bi-fuel or multi-fuel vehicles, a gaseous fuel system as well as storage tanks for gaseous fuel; and
(e)
in the case of pre-compressed air propulsion, storage tanks to store compressed air.
