Article 23
Cooperation between Member States and the Commission
Member States and the Commission shall cooperate in attaining the following objectives:
(a) making optimum use of the information notified pursuant to this Directive, notably by developing appropriate telematic links between coastal stations and port authorities with a view to exchanging data relating to ships' movements, their estimated times of arrival in ports and their cargo;
(b) developing and enhancing the effectiveness of telematic links between the coastal stations of the Member States with a view to obtaining a clearer picture of traffic, improving the monitoring of ships in transit, and harmonising and, as far as possible, streamlining the reports required from ships en route;
(c) extending the cover of and/or updating the Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system with a view to enhanced identification and monitoring of ships. To this end, the Member States and the Commission shall work together to put in place, where necessary, mandatory reporting systems, mandatory vessel traffic services and appropriate ships' routing systems, with a view to submitting them to the IMO for approval;
(d) drawing up, if appropriate, concerted plans to accommodate ships in distress.
