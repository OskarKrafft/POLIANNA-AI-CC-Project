Article 7
Maximum sulphur content of marine fuels used by ships at berth in Union ports
1.   Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that ships at berth in Union ports do not use marine fuels with a sulphur content exceeding 0,10 % by mass, allowing sufficient time for the crew to complete any necessary fuel-changeover operation as soon as possible after arrival at berth and as late as possible before departure.
Member States shall require the time of any fuel-changeover operation to be recorded in ships' logbooks.
2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply:
(a)
whenever, according to published timetables, ships are due to be at berth for less than two hours;
(b)
to ships which switch off all engines and use shore-side electricity while at berth in ports.
3.   Member States shall ensure that marine gas oils are not placed on the market in their territory if the sulphur content of those marine gas oils exceeds 0,10 % by mass.
