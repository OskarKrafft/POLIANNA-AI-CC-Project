Article 12
Change in the supply of fuels
If, as a result of a sudden change in the supply of crude oil, petroleum products or other hydrocarbons, it becomes difficult for a Member State to apply the limits on the maximum sulphur content referred to in Articles 3 and 4, that Member State shall inform the Commission thereof. The Commission may authorise a higher limit to be applicable within the territory of that Member State for a period not exceeding 6 months. It shall notify the Council and the Member States of its decision. Any Member State may refer that decision to the Council within 1 month. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may adopt a different decision within 2 months.
