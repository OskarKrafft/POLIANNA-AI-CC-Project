Article 3
Maximum sulphur content of heavy fuel oil
1.   Member States shall ensure that heavy fuel oils are not used within their territory if their sulphur content exceeds 1,00 % by mass.
2.   Until 31 December 2015, subject to appropriate monitoring of emissions by competent authorities, paragraph 1 shall not apply to heavy fuel oils used:
(a)
in combustion plants which fall within the scope of Directive 2001/80/EC, which are subject to Article 4(1) or (2) or point (a) of Article 4(3) of that Directive and which comply with the emission limits for sulphur dioxide for such plants as set out in that Directive;
(b)
in combustion plants which fall within the scope of Directive 2001/80/EC, which are subject to point (b) of Article 4(3) and Article 4(6) of that Directive and the monthly average sulphur dioxide emissions of which do not exceed 1 700 mg/Nm3 at an oxygen content in the flue gas of 3 % by volume on a dry basis;
(c)
in combustion plants which do not fall under points (a) or (b), and the monthly average sulphur dioxide emissions of which do not exceed 1 700 mg/Nm3 at an oxygen content in the flue gas of 3 % by volume on a dry basis;
(d)
for combustion in refineries, where the monthly average of emissions of sulphur dioxide averaged over all combustion plants in the refinery, irrespective of the type of fuel or fuel combination used, but excluding plants which fall under points (a) and (b), gas turbines and gas engines, does not exceed 1 700 mg/Nm3 at an oxygen content in the flue gas of 3 % by volume on a dry basis.
3.   As from 1 January 2016, subject to appropriate monitoring of emissions by competent authorities, paragraph 1 shall not apply to heavy fuel oils used:
(a)
in combustion plants which fall within the scope of Chapter III of Directive 2010/75/EU, and which comply with the emission limits for sulphur dioxide for such plants as set out in Annex V to that Directive or, where those emission limit values are not applicable in accordance with that Directive, for which the monthly average sulphur dioxide emissions does not exceed 1 700 mg/Nm3 at an oxygen content in the flue gas of 3 % by volume on a dry basis;
(b)
in combustion plants which do not fall under point (a), and the monthly average sulphur dioxide emissions of which does not exceed 1 700 mg/Nm3 at an oxygen content in the flue gas of 3 % by volume on a dry basis;
(c)
for combustion in refineries, where the monthly average of emissions of sulphur dioxide averaged over all combustion plants in the refinery, irrespective of the type of fuel or fuel combination used, but excluding plants falling under point (a), gas turbines and gas engines, does not exceed 1 700 mg/Nm3 at an oxygen content in the flue gas of 3 % by volume on a dry basis.
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that no combustion plant using heavy fuel oil with a sulphur concentration greater than that referred to in paragraph 1 is operated without a permit issued by a competent authority, which specifies the emission limits.
