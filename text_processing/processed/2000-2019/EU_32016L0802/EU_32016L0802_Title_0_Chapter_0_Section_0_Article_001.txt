Article 1
Purpose and scope
1.   The purpose of this Directive is to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment.
2.   Reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain petroleum-derived liquid fuels shall be achieved by imposing limits on the sulphur content of such fuels as a condition for their use within Member States' territory, territorial seas and exclusive economic zones or pollution control zones.
The limitations on the sulphur content of certain petroleum-derived liquid fuels as laid down in this Directive shall not, however, apply to:
(a)
fuels intended for the purposes of research and testing;
(b)
fuels intended for processing prior to final combustion;
(c)
fuels to be processed in the refining industry;
(d)
fuels used and placed on the market in the outermost regions of the Union, provided that the relevant Member States ensure that, in those regions:
(i)
air quality standards are respected;
(ii)
heavy fuel oils are not used if their sulphur content exceeds 3 % by mass;
(e)
fuels used by warships and other vessels on military service. However, each Member State shall endeavour to ensure, by the adoption of appropriate measures not impairing the operations or operational capability of such ships, that the ships act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practical, with this Directive;
(f)
any use of fuels in a vessel necessary for the specific purpose of securing the safety of a ship or saving life at sea;
(g)
any use of fuels in a ship necessitated by damage sustained by it or its equipment, provided that all reasonable measures are taken after the occurrence of the damage to prevent or minimise excess emissions and that measures are taken as soon as possible to repair the damage. This shall not apply if the owner or master acted either with intent to cause damage, or recklessly;
(h)
without prejudice to Article 5, fuels used on board vessels employing emission abatement methods in accordance with Articles 8 and 10.
