Article 10
Trials of new emission abatement methods
Member States may, in cooperation with other Member States, as appropriate, approve trials of ship emission abatement methods on vessels flying their flag, or in sea areas within their jurisdiction. During those trials, the use of marine fuels meeting the requirements of Articles 6 and 7 shall not be mandatory, provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the Commission and any port State concerned are notified in writing at least 6 months before trials begin;
(b)
permits for trials do not exceed 18 months in duration;
(c)
all ships involved install tamper-proof equipment for the continuous monitoring of funnel gas emissions and use it throughout the trial period;
(d)
all ships involved achieve emission reductions which are at least equivalent to those which would be achieved through the sulphur limits for fuels specified in this Directive;
(e)
there are proper waste management systems in place for any waste generated by the emission abatement methods throughout the trial period;
(f)
there is an assessment of impacts on the marine environment, particularly ecosystems in enclosed ports, harbours and estuaries throughout the trial period; and
(g)
full results are provided to the Commission and are made publicly available within 6 months of the end of the trials.
