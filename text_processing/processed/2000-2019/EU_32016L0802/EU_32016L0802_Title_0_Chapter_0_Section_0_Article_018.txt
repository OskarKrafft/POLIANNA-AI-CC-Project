Article 18
Penalties
Member States shall determine the penalties applicable to breaches of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive.
The penalties determined shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and may include fines calculated in such a way as to ensure that the fines at least deprive those responsible of the economic benefits derived from the infringement of the national provisions as referred to in the first paragraph and that those fines gradually increase for repeated infringements.
