Article 8
Emission abatement methods
1.   Member States shall allow the use of emission abatement methods by ships of all flags in their ports, territorial seas, exclusive economic zones and pollution control zones, as an alternative to using marine fuels that meet the requirements of Articles 6 and 7, subject to paragraphs 2 and 4 of this Article.
2.   Ships using the emission abatement methods referred to in paragraph 1 shall continuously achieve reductions of sulphur dioxide emissions that are at least equivalent to the reductions that would be achieved by using marine fuels that meet the requirements of Articles 6 and 7. Equivalent emission values shall be determined in accordance with Annex I.
3.   Member States shall, as an alternative solution for reducing emissions, encourage the use of onshore power supply systems by docked vessels.
4.   The emission abatement methods referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with the criteria specified in the instruments referred to in Annex II.
5.   Where justified in the light of scientific and technical progress regarding alternative emission abatement methods and in such a way as to ensure strict consistency with the relevant instruments and standards adopted by the IMO, the Commission shall:
(a)
be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 16, amending Annexes I and II;
(b)
adopt implementing acts laying down the detailed requirements for monitoring of emissions, where appropriate. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 17(2).
