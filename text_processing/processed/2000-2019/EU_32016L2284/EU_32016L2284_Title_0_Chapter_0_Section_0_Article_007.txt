Article 7
Financial support
The Commission shall endeavour to facilitate access to existing Union funds, in accordance with the legal provisions governing those funds, in order to support the measures to be taken with a view to complying with the objectives of this Directive.
Those Union funds include present and future available funding under, inter alia:
(a)
the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation;
(b)
the European Structural and Investment Funds, including relevant funding under the common agricultural policy;
(c)
instruments for the funding of environment and climate action such as the LIFE programme.
The Commission shall evaluate the possibility of creating a one-stop shop, where any interested party can easily check the availability of Union funds, and the related access procedures, for projects which address air pollution concerns.
