(5)
‘sulphur dioxide’ or ‘SO2’ means all sulphur compounds expressed as sulphur dioxide, including sulphur trioxide (SO3), sulphuric acid (H2SO4), and reduced sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide (H2S), mercaptans and dimethyl sulphides;
(6)
‘nitrogen oxides’ or ‘NOx’ means nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, expressed as nitrogen dioxide;
