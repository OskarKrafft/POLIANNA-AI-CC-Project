- transboundary environmental issues, in particular air, soil and water pollution,
- environmental impacts related to the integration of developing countries into the world economy,
- the inclusion in development cooperation projects of environmental considerations enabling the sustainable dimension of these projects to be distinguished, identified and assessed,
- environmental impacts of macroeconomic and sectoral policies in developing countries,
- sustainable patterns of production and consumption,
- sustainable management and use of natural and environmental resources in all productive sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and industry,
- environmental problems caused by the non-sustainable use of resources due to poverty,
- sustainable production and use of energy and in particular encouragement of the use of renewable energy sources, increased energy efficiency, energy saving and the replacement of especially damaging energy sources by others which are less so,
- sustainable production and use of chemical products, in particular hazardous and toxic substances,
- conservation of biological diversity - especially by protecting ecosystems and habitats and the conservation of species diversity - the sustainable use of its components, the involvement of holders of traditional knowledge on the use of biological diversity, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources,
- the management of fresh water resources,
- coastal zone, estuary and wetland management,
- desertification,
- urban environment problems relating, inter alia, to transport, waste, waste water, air pollution and noise, and the quality of drinking water,
- environmental problems related to industrial activities.
2. Activities eligible for financing include, amongst others:
- support for the drawing up of national, regional and local policies, plans and strategies, programmes and projects for sustainable development,
- schemes to build up the institutional and operational capacities of actors in the development process, i.e. government, non-governmental organisations, private sector, civil society, indigenous peoples, at national, regional and local level,
- pilot projects in the field including those involving environmentally-sound technologies adapted to local constraints and needs,
- the promotion of trade in products that have been produced in a sustainable manner,
- the creation of instruments for sustainable development, inter alia, trade-related instruments such as labelling and certification schemes and green trade initiatives,
- the formulation of guidelines, operating manuals and instruments aimed at promoting sustainable development and environmental integration in particular in the form of public databases and databanks on the internet (open to the public),
- information campaigns on hazardous substances, and toxic waste and pesticides in particular,
- support for the development and application of environment assessment tools in the preparation and implementation of policies, strategies, programmes and projects,
- raising awareness of local populations and key actors in the development process and development cooperation with regard to the implications of sustainable development, in particular through information campaigns and training,
- inventory, accounting and statistical work, in order to improve the quality of environmental data and environmental indicators.
3. In the selection, preparation, implementation and evaluation of activities, particular attention shall be paid to:
- the contribution to the overall objective of eradicating poverty,
- local initiatives involving innovative measures aimed at sustainable development,
- active involvement, support and ownership of local populations, including indigenous communities,
- gender-specific roles, knowledge, perspectives and contributions of women/girls and men/boys in the sustainable management and use of natural resources,
- the potential for integration into the wider context of Community development cooperation policies and programmes,
- the internalisation of environmental costs, including through economic instruments,
- the contribution to strengthening regional cooperation in the area of sustainable development.
Lesson-learning and dissemination of the results of the activities carried out will be essential elements of implementing this Regulation, including support of the implementation of international environmental agreements.
