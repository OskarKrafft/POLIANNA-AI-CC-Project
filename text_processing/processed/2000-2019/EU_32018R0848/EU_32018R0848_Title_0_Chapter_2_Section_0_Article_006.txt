Article 6
Specific principles applicable to agricultural activities and aquaculture
As regards agricultural activities and aquaculture, organic production shall, in particular, be based on the following specific principles:
(a)
the maintenance and enhancement of soil life and natural soil fertility, soil stability, soil water retention and soil biodiversity, preventing and combating loss of soil organic matter, soil compaction and soil erosion, and the nourishing of plants primarily through the soil ecosystem;
(b)
the limitation of the use of non-renewable resources and external inputs to a minimum;
(c)
the recycling of waste and by-products of plant and animal origin as input in plant and livestock production;
(d)
the maintenance of plant health by preventive measures, in particular the choice of appropriate species, varieties or heterogeneous material resistant to pests and diseases, appropriate crop rotations, mechanical and physical methods and protection of the natural enemies of pests;
(e)
the use of seeds and animals with a high degree of genetic diversity, disease resistance and longevity;
(f)
in the choosing of plant varieties, having regard to the particularities of the specific organic production systems, focussing on agronomic performance, disease resistance, adaptation to diverse local soil and climate conditions and respect for the natural crossing barriers;
(g)
the use of organic plant reproductive material, such as plant reproductive material of organic heterogeneous material and of organic varieties suitable for organic production;
(h)
the production of organic varieties through natural reproductive ability and focussing on containment within natural crossing barriers;
(i)
without prejudice to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 and to the national plant variety rights granted under Member Statesâ€™ national law, the possibility for farmers to use plant reproductive material obtained from their own farms in order to foster genetic resources adapted to the special conditions of organic production;
(j)
in the choosing of animal breeds, having regard to a high degree of genetic diversity, the capacity of animals to adapt to local conditions, their breeding value, their longevity, their vitality and their resistance to disease or health problems;
(k)
the practice of site-adapted and land-related livestock production;
(l)
the application of animal husbandry practices which enhance the immune system and strengthen the natural defence against diseases, including regular exercise and access to open air areas and pastures;
(m)
the feeding of livestock with organic feed composed of agricultural ingredients resulting from organic production and of natural non-agricultural substances;
(n)
the production of organic livestock products derived from animals that have been raised on organic holdings throughout their lives since birth or hatching;
(o)
the continuing health of the aquatic environment and the quality of surrounding aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems;
(p)
the feeding of aquatic organisms with feed from sustainably exploited fisheries in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 or with organic feed composed of agricultural ingredients resulting from organic production, including organic aquaculture, and of natural non-agricultural substances;
(q)
avoiding any endangerment of species of conservation interest that might arise from organic production.
