Article 5
General principles
Organic production is a sustainable management system that is based on the following general principles:
(a)
respect for nature’s systems and cycles and the sustainment and enhancement of the state of the soil, the water and the air, of the health of plants and animals, and of the balance between them;
(b)
the preservation of natural landscape elements, such as natural heritage sites;
(c)
the responsible use of energy and natural resources, such as water, soil, organic matter and air;
(d)
the production of a wide variety of high-quality food and other agricultural and aquaculture products that respond to consumers’ demand for goods that are produced by the use of processes that do not harm the environment, human health, plant health or animal health and welfare;
(e)
ensuring the integrity of organic production at all stages of the production, processing and distribution of food and feed;
(f)
the appropriate design and management of biological processes, based on ecological systems and using natural resources which are internal to the management system, using methods that:
(i)
use living organisms and mechanical production methods;
(ii)
practice soil-related crop cultivation and land-related livestock production, or practice aquaculture which complies with the principle of the sustainable exploitation of aquatic resources;
(iii)
exclude the use of GMOs, products produced from GMOs, and products produced by GMOs, other than veterinary medicinal products;
(iv)
are based on risk assessment and the use of precautionary measures and preventive measures, where appropriate;
(g)
the restriction of the use of external inputs; where external inputs are required or the appropriate management practices and methods referred to in point (f) do not exist, the external inputs shall be limited to:
(i)
inputs from organic production; in the case of plant reproductive material, priority shall be given to varieties selected for their ability to meet the specific needs and objectives of organic agriculture;
(ii)
natural or naturally-derived substances;
(iii)
low solubility mineral fertilisers;
(h)
the adaptation of the production process, where necessary and within the framework of this Regulation, to take account of the sanitary status, regional differences in the ecological balance, climatic and local conditions, stages of development and specific husbandry practices;
(i)
the exclusion from the whole organic food chain of animal cloning, of rearing artificially induced polyploid animals and of ionising radiation;
(j)
the observance of a high level of animal welfare respecting species-specific needs.
