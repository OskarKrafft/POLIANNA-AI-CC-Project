Article 22
Adoption of exceptional production rules
1.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 54 supplementing this Regulation by laying down:
(a)
the criteria to determine whether a situation qualifies as catastrophic circumstances deriving from an ‘adverse climatic event’, ‘animal diseases’, an ‘environmental incident’, a ‘natural disaster’ or a ‘catastrophic event’, as defined in points (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, respectively, as well as any comparable situation;
(b)
specific rules, including possible derogations from this Regulation, on how Member States are to deal with such catastrophic circumstances if they decide to apply this Article; and
(c)
specific rules on monitoring and reporting in such cases.
Those criteria and rules shall be subject to the principles of organic production laid down in Chapter II.
2.   Where a Member State has formally recognised an event as a natural disaster as referred to in Article 18(3) or Article 24(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, and that event makes it impossible to comply with the production rules laid down in this Regulation, that Member State may grant derogations from the production rules for a limited period until organic production can be re-established, subject to the principles laid down in Chapter II and to any delegated act adopted in accordance with paragraph 1.
3.   Member States may adopt measures in accordance with the delegated act referred to in paragraph 1 to allow organic production to continue or recommence in the event of catastrophic circumstances.
