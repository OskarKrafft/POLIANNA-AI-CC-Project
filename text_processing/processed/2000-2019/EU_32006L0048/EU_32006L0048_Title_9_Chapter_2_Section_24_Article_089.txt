Article 89
1.   Subject to the approval of the competent authorities, credit institutions permitted to use the IRB Approach in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts for one or more exposure classes may apply Subsection 1 for the following:
(a)
the exposure class referred to in point (a) of Article 86(1), where the number of material counterparties is limited and it would be unduly burdensome for the credit institution to implement a rating system for these counterparties;
(b)
the exposure class referred to in point (b) of Article 86(1), where the number of material counterparties is limited and it would be unduly burdensome for the credit institution to implement a rating system for these counterparties;
(c)
exposures in non-significant business units as well as exposure classes that are immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile;
(d)
exposures to central governments of the home Member State and to their regional governments, local authorities and administrative bodies, provided that:
(i)
there is no difference in risk between the exposures to that central government and those other exposures because of specific public arrangements, and
(ii)
exposures to the central government are assigned a 0 % risk weight under Subsection 1;
(e)
exposures of a credit institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary or a subsidiary of its parent undertaking provided that the counterparty is an institution or a financial holding company, financial institution, asset management company or ancillary services undertaking subject to appropriate prudential requirements or an undertaking linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC and exposures between credit institutions which meet the requirements set out in Article 80(8);
(f)
equity exposures to entities whose credit obligations qualify for a 0 % risk weight under Subsection 1 (including those publicly sponsored entities where a zero risk weight can be applied);
(g)
equity exposures incurred under legislative programmes to promote specified sectors of the economy that provide significant subsidies for the investment to the credit institution and involve some form of government oversight and restrictions on the equity investments. This exclusion is limited to an aggregate of 10 % of original own funds plus additional own funds;
(h)
the exposures identified in Annex VI, Part 1, point 40 meeting the conditions specified therein; or
(i)
State and State-reinsured guarantees pursuant to Annex VIII, Part 2, point 19.
This paragraph shall not prevent the competent authorities of other Member States to allow the application of the rules of Subsection 1 for equity exposures which have been allowed for this treatment in other Member States.
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the equity exposure class of a credit institution shall be considered material if their aggregate value, excluding equity exposures incurred under legislative programmes as referred to in paragraph 1, point (g), exceeds, on average over the preceding year, 10 % of the credit institution's own funds. If the number of those equity exposures is less than 10 individual holdings, that threshold shall be 5 % of the credit institution's own funds.
