Article 137
1.   Pending further coordination of consolidation methods, Member States shall provide that, where the parent undertaking of one or more credit institutions is a mixed‐activity holding company, the competent authorities responsible for the authorisation and supervision of those credit institutions shall, by approaching the mixed‐activity holding company and its subsidiaries either directly or via credit institution subsidiaries, require them to supply any information which would be relevant for the purpose of supervising the credit institution subsidiaries.
2.   Member States shall provide that their competent authorities may carry out, or have carried out by external inspectors, on‐the‐spot inspections to verify information received from mixed‐activity holding companies and their subsidiaries. If the mixed‐activity holding company or one of its subsidiaries is an insurance undertaking, the procedure laid down in Article 140(1) may also be used. If a mixed‐activity holding company or one of its subsidiaries is situated in a Member State other than that in which the credit institution subsidiary is situated, on‐the‐spot verification of information shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 141.
