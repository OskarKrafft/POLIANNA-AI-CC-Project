Article 95
1.   Where significant credit risk associated with securitised exposures has been transferred from the originator credit institution in accordance with the terms of Annex IX, Part 2, that credit institution may:
(a)
in the case of a traditional securitisation, exclude from its calculation of risk‐weighted exposure amounts, and, as relevant, expected loss amounts, the exposures which it has securitised; and
(b)
in the case of a synthetic securitisation, calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts, and, as relevant, expected loss amounts, in respect of the securitised exposures in accordance with Annex IX, Part 2.
2.   Where paragraph 1 applies, the originator credit institution shall calculate the risk‐weighted exposure amounts prescribed in Annex IX for the positions that it may hold in the securitisation.
Where the originator credit institution fails to transfer significant credit risk in accordance with paragraph 1, it need not calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for any positions it may have in the securitisation in question.
