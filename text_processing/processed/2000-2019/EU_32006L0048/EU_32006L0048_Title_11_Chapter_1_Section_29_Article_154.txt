Article 154

Competent authorities which do not exercise the discretion provided for in the first subparagraph in relation to exposures to counterparties situated in their territory may set a higher number of days for exposures to counterparties situated in the territories of other Member States, the competent authorities of which have exercised that discretion. The specific number shall fall within 90 days and such figures as the other competent authorities have set for exposures to such counterparties within their territory.
2.   For credit institutions applying for the use of the IRB Approach before 2010, subject to the approval of the competent authorities, the three‐years' use requirement prescribed in Article 84(3) may be reduced to a period no shorter than one year until 31 December 2009.

If an acquisition increases the proportional share of ownership in a specific holding the exceeding Part of the holding shall not be subject to the exemption. Nor shall the exemption apply to holdings that were originally subject to the exemption, but have been sold and then bought back.

The specific number shall fall within 90‐ up to a figure of 180 days if local conditions make it appropriate.
