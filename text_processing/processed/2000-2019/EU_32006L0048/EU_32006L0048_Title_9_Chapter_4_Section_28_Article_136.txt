Article 136
1.   Competent authorities shall require any credit institution that does not meet the requirements of this Directive to take the necessary actions or steps at an early stage to address the situation.
For those purposes, the measures available to the competent authorities shall include the following:
(a)
obliging credit institutions to hold own funds in excess of the minimum level laid down in Article 75;
(b)
requiring the reinforcement of the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies implemented to comply with Articles 22 and 123;
(c)
requiring credit institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds requirements;
(d)
restricting or limiting the business, operations or network of credit institutions; and
(e)
requiring the reduction of the risk inherent in the activities, products and systems of credit institutions.
The adoption of these measures shall be subject to Chapter 1, Section 2.
2.   A specific own funds requirement in excess of the minimum level laid down in Article 75 shall be imposed by the competent authorities at least on the credit institutions which do not meet the requirements laid down in Articles 22, 109 and 123, or in respect of which a negative determination has been made on the issue described in Article 124, paragraph 3, if the sole application of other measures is unlikely to improve the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies sufficiently within an appropriate timeframe.
