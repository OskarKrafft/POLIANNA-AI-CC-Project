Article 9
Rules and conditions for the affixing of CE marking
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the construction product or to a label attached to it. Where this is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the product, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documents.
2.   The CE marking shall be followed by the two last digits of the year in which it was first affixed, the name and the registered address of the manufacturer, or the identifying mark allowing identification of the name and address of the manufacturer easily and without any ambiguity, the unique identification code of the product-type, the reference number of the declaration of performance, the level or class of the performance declared, the reference to the harmonised technical specification applied, the identification number of the notified body, if applicable, and the intended use as laid down in the harmonised technical specification applied.
3.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the construction product is placed on the market. It may be followed by a pictogram or any other mark notably indicating a special risk or use.
