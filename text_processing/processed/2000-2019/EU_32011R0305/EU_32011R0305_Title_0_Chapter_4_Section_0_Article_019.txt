Article 19
European Assessment Document
1.   Following a request for a European Technical Assessment by a manufacturer, a European Assessment Document shall be drawn up and adopted by the organisation of TABs for any construction product not covered or not fully covered by a harmonised standard, for which the performance in relation to its essential characteristics cannot be entirely assessed according to an existing harmonised standard, because, inter alia:
(a)
the product does not fall within the scope of any existing harmonised standard;
(b)
for at least one essential characteristic of that product, the assessment method provided for in the harmonised standard is not appropriate; or
(c)
the harmonised standard does not provide for any assessment method in relation to at least one essential characteristic of that product.
2.   The procedure for adopting the European Assessment Document shall respect the principles set out in Article 20 and shall comply with Article 21 and Annex II.
3.   The Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 60 to amend Annex II and establish supplementary procedural rules for the development and adoption of a European Assessment Document.
4.   Where appropriate, the Commission, after having consulted the Standing Committee on Construction, shall take existing European Assessment Documents as a basis for the mandates to be issued pursuant to Article 17(1) with a view to developing harmonised standards as regards the products referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
