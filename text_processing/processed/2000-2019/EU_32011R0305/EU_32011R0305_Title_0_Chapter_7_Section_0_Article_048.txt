Article 48
Notification procedure
1.   Notifying authorities may notify only bodies which have satisfied the requirements laid down in Article 43.
2.   They shall notify the Commission and the other Member States, notably using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.
Exceptionally, for cases set out in point 3 of Annex V, for which the appropriate electronic tool is not available, a hard copy of the notification shall be accepted.
3.   The notification shall include full details of the functions to be performed, reference to the relevant harmonised technical specification and, for the purposes of the system set out in Annex V, the essential characteristics for which the body is competent.
However, reference to the relevant harmonised technical specification is not required in the cases set out in point 3 of Annex V.
4.   Where a notification is not based on an accreditation certificate as referred to in Article 47(2), the notifying authority shall provide the Commission and the other Member States with all documentary evidence which attests to the notified body’s competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that that body will be monitored regularly and will continue to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 43.
5.   The body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body only where no objections are raised by the Commission or the other Member States within 2 weeks of notification where an accreditation certificate is used or within 2 months of notification where an accreditation certificate is not used.
Only such a body shall be considered as a notified body for the purpose of this Regulation.
6.   The Commission and the other Member States shall be notified of any subsequent relevant changes to the notification.
