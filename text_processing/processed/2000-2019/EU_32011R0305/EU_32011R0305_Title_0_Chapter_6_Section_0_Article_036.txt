Article 36
Use of Appropriate Technical Documentation
1.   In determining the product-type, a manufacturer may replace type-testing or type-calculation by Appropriate Technical Documentation demonstrating that:
(a)
for one or several essential characteristics of the construction product, which the manufacturer places on the market, that product is deemed to achieve a certain level or class of performance without testing or calculation, or without further testing or calculation, in accordance with the conditions set out in the relevant harmonised technical specification or a Commission decision;
(b)
the construction product, covered by a harmonised standard, which the manufacturer places on the market corresponds to the product-type of another construction product, manufactured by another manufacturer and already tested in accordance with the relevant harmonised standard. When these conditions are fulfilled, the manufacturer is entitled to declare performance corresponding to all or part of the test results of this other product. The manufacturer may use the test results obtained by another manufacturer only after having obtained an authorisation of that manufacturer, who remains responsible for the accuracy, reliability and stability of those test results; or
(c)
the construction product, covered by a harmonised technical specification, which the manufacturer places on the market is a system made of components, which the manufacturer assembles duly following precise instructions given by the provider of such a system or of a component thereof, who has already tested that system or that component for one or several of its essential characteristics in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specification. When these conditions are fulfilled, the manufacturer is entitled to declare performance corresponding to all or part of the test results for the system or the component provided to him. The manufacturer may use the test results obtained by another manufacturer or system provider only after having obtained an authorisation of that manufacturer or system provider, who remains responsible for the accuracy, reliability and stability of those test results.
2.   If the construction product referred to in paragraph 1 belongs to a family of construction products for which the applicable system for assessment and verification of constancy of performance is system 1 + or 1, as set out in Annex V, the Appropriate Technical Documentation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be verified by a notified product certification body as referred to in Annex V.
