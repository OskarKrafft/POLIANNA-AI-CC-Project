Article 50
Changes to the notification
1.   Where a notifying authority has ascertained or has been informed that a notified body no longer meets the requirements laid down in Article 43, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the notifying authority shall restrict, suspend or withdraw the notification as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or to fulfil those obligations. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly, notably using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.
2.   In the event of withdrawal, restriction or suspension of notification or where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying Member State concerned shall take the appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that body are either processed by another notified body or kept available for the responsible notifying and market surveillance authorities at their request.
