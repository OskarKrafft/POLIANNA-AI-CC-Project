Article 57
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 56(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator(s) and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not.
The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator(s).
2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant construction product is withdrawn from their markets and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.
3.   Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the construction product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards as referred to in Article 56(5)(b), the Commission shall inform the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and shall bring the matter before the Committee set up pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. That Committee shall consult with the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and deliver its opinion without delay.
Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the construction product is attributed to shortcomings in the European Assessment Document or in the Specific Technical Documentation as referred to in Article 56(5)(b), the Commission shall bring the matter before the Standing Committee on Construction and subsequently adopt the appropriate measures.
