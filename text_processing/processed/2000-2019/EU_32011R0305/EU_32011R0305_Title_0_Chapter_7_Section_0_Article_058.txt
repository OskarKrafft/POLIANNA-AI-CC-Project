Article 58
Complying construction products which nevertheless present a risk to health and safety
1.   Where, having performed an evaluation pursuant to Article 56(1), a Member State finds that, although a construction product is in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a risk for the fulfilment of the basic requirements for construction works, to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the construction product concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the construction product from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, which it may prescribe.
2.   The economic operator shall ensure that any corrective action is taken in respect of all the construction products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.
3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the construction product concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the product, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.
4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator(s) and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, propose appropriate measures.
5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator(s).
