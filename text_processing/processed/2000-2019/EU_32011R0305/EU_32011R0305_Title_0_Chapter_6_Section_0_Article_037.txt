Article 37
Use of simplified procedures by micro-enterprises
Micro-enterprises manufacturing construction products covered by a harmonised standard may replace the determination of the product-type on the basis of type-testing for the applicable systems 3 and 4 as set out in Annex V by using methods differing from those contained in the applicable harmonised standard. Those manufacturers may also treat construction products to which system 3 applies in accordance with provisions for system 4. When a manufacturer uses these simplified procedures, the manufacturer shall demonstrate compliance of the construction product with the applicable requirements by means of a Specific Technical Documentation and shall demonstrate the equivalence of the procedures used to the procedures laid down in the harmonised standards.
