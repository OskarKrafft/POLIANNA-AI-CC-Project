notified the Commission and the Member State under whose jurisdiction the media service provider falls of its intention to take such measures.

that the broadcaster in question has established itself in the Member State having jurisdiction in order to circumvent the stricter rules, in the fields coordinated by this Directive, which would be applicable to it if it were established within the first Member State,
it may adopt appropriate measures against the broadcaster concerned.
Such measures shall be objectively necessary, applied in a non-discriminatory manner and be proportionate to the objectives which they pursue.
4.   A Member State may take measures pursuant to paragraph 3 only if the following conditions are met:
