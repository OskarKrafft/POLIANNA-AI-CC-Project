Article 15
Cooperation in the allocation of infrastructure capacity on more than one network
1. Infrastructure managers shall cooperate to enable the efficient creation and allocation of infrastructure capacity which crosses more than one network. They shall organise international train paths, in particular within the framework of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network. They shall establish such procedures as are appropriate to enable this to take place. These procedures shall be bound by the rules set out in this Directive.
The procedure established in order to coordinate the allocation of infrastructure capacity at an international level shall associate representatives of infrastructure managers for all railway infrastructures whose allocation decisions have an impact on more than one other infrastructure manager. Appropriate representatives of infrastructure managers from outside the Community may be associated with these procedures. The Commission shall be informed and invited to attend as an observer.
2. At any meeting or other activity undertaken to permit the allocation of infrastructure capacity for trans-network train services, decisions shall only be taken by representatives of infrastructure managers.
3. The participants in the cooperation referred to paragraph 1 shall ensure that its membership, methods of operation and all relevant criteria which are used for assessing and allocating infrastructure capacity be made publicly available.
4. Working in cooperation as referred to in paragraph 1, infrastructure managers shall assess the need for, and may where necessary propose and organise international train paths to facilitate the operation of freight trains which are subject to an ad hoc request as referred to in Article 23.
Such prearranged international train paths shall be made available to applicants via any of the participating infrastructure managers.
