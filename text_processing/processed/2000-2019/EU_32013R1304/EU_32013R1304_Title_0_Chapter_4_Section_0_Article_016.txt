Article 16
Youth Employment Initiative
The YEI shall support the fight against youth unemployment in eligible regions of the Union through providing support to actions under Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of this Regulation. It shall target all young persons under the age of 25 not in employment, education or training, residing in eligible regions, who are inactive or unemployed including the long-term unemployed, and whether or not registered as seeking work. On a voluntary basis, Member States may decide to extend the target group to include young persons under the age of 30.
For the purpose of the YEI for 2014-2015, "eligible regions" are those NUTS level 2 regions that have youth unemployment rates for young persons aged 15 to 24 of more than 25 % in 2012 and, for Member States where the youth unemployment rate has increased by more than 30 % in 2012, NUTS level 2 regions that have youth unemployment rates of more than 20 % in 2012.
The resources for the YEI may be revised upwards for the years 2016 to 2020 in the framework of the budgetary procedure in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 1311/2013. For the determination of the regions eligible for the YEI for the period 2016-2020, the reference to 2012 data in the second subparagraph shall be construed as a reference to the latest available annual data. The breakdown by Member State of the additional resources shall follow the same steps as the initial allocation in accordance with Annex VIII of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
In agreement with the Commission, Member States may decide to allocate a limited amount not exceeding 10 % of the funds under the YEI to young persons residing in sub-regions which experience high youth unemployment levels and which are outside the eligible NUTS level 2 regions.
