Article 22
Financial support
1.   The Commission decision adopting an operational programme shall fix the maximum amount of support from the specific allocation for YEI and the corresponding ESF support, as a global amount and also by category of regions, for each priority axis. The corresponding ESF support shall at least match the support from the specific allocation for YEI for each priority axis.
2.   On the basis of the amounts referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall also fix the ratio between the categories of regions for the ESF support for each priority axis.
3.   Where the YEI is implemented by a specific priority axis covering eligible regions from more than one category, the highest co-financing rate shall apply with regard to the ESF allocation.
The specific allocation for YEI shall not be subject to the national co-financing requirement.
The overall co-financing rate of the priority axis fixed by the Commission decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall be calculated taking into account the co-financing rate of the ESF allocation together with the special allocation for the YEI.
