Article 14
Simplified cost options
1.   In addition to the options referred to in Article 67 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the Commission may reimburse expenditure paid by Member States on the basis of standard scales of unit costs and lump sums defined by the Commission. The amounts calculated on this basis shall be regarded as public support paid to beneficiaries and as eligible expenditure for the purpose of applying Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
For the purpose of the first subparagraph, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 24 concerning the type of operations covered, the definitions of the standard scales of unit costs and lump sums and their maximum amounts, which may be adjusted according to the applicable commonly agreed methods, taking due account of experience gained during the previous programming period.
Financial audit shall exclusively aim at verifying that the conditions for reimbursement by the Commission on the basis of standard scales of unit costs and lump sums have been fulfilled.
Where funding on the basis of standard scales of unit costs and lump sums, in accordance with the first subparagraph, is used, the Member State may apply its accounting practices to support operations. For the purpose of this Regulation and Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, such accounting practices and the resulting amounts shall not be subject to audit by the audit authority or by the Commission.
2.   In accordance with Article 67(1)(d) and (5)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a flat rate of up to 40 % of the eligible direct staff costs may be used in order to cover the remaining eligible costs of an operation without a requirement for the Member State to execute any calculation to determine the applicable rate.
3.   In addition to the methods stipulated in Article 67(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, where the public support for grants and repayable assistance does not exceed EUR 100 000, the amounts referred to in Article 67(1)(b), (c) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 may be established on a case-by-case basis by reference to a draft budget agreed ex ante by the managing authority.
4.   Without prejudice to Article 67 (4) of Regulation (EU) No (1303/2013), grants and repayable assistance for which the public support does not exceed EUR 50 000 shall take the form of standard scales of unit costs or lump sums in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article or with Article 67 of Regulation (EU) No (1303/2013) or flat rates in accordance with Article 67 of Regulation (EU) No (1303/2013), except for operations receiving support within the framework of a State aid scheme. Where flat-rate financing is used, the categories of costs which are used to calculate the rate may be reimbursed in accordance with Article 67(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No (1303/2013).
