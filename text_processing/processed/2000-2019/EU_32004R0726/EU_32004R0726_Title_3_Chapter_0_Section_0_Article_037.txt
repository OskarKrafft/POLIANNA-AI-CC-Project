Article 37
1. The marketing authorisation shall be refused if, after verification of the particulars and documents submitted in accordance with Article 31, it appears that:
(a) the applicant has not properly or sufficiently demonstrated the quality, safety or efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product;
(b) in the case of zootechnical veterinary medicinal products and performance enhancers, when the safety and welfare of the animals and/or consumer safety have not been sufficiently taken into account;
(c) the withdrawal period recommended by the applicant is not long enough to ensure that foodstuffs obtained from treated animals do not contain residues which might constitute a health hazard for the consumer or is insufficiently substantiated;
(d) the veterinary medicinal product is presented for a use prohibited under other Community provisions.
Authorisation shall likewise be refused if particulars or documents provided by the applicant in accordance with Article 31 are incorrect or if the labelling and package leaflets proposed by the applicant are not in accordance with Title V of Directive 2001/82/EC.
2. The refusal of a Community marketing authorisation shall constitute a prohibition on the placing on the market of the veterinary medicinal product concerned throughout the Community.
3. Information about all refusals and the reasons for them shall be made publicly accessible.
