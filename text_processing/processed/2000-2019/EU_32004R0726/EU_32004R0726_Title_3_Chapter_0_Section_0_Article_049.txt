Article 49
1. The holder of the marketing authorisation for a veterinary medicinal product shall ensure that all suspected serious adverse reactions, and adverse human reactions to a veterinary medicinal product authorised in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation occurring within the Community which a health-care professional brings to his attention are recorded and reported promptly to the Member States in the territory of which the incident occurred no later than 15 days following receipt of the information.
The holder of the marketing authorisation shall record any other suspected serious adverse reactions and human adverse reactions occurring within the Community, in accordance with the guidelines referred to in Article 51, of which he may reasonably be expected to be aware, and promptly notify Member States in the territory of which the incident occurred and the Agency, and no later than 15 days following receipt of the information.
2. The holder of the marketing authorisation for a veterinary medicinal product shall ensure that all suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, and adverse human reactions, and any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of any infectious agent occurring in the territory of a third country are reported promptly to the Member States and the Agency, and no later than 15 days following receipt of the information. The provisions for the reporting of suspected unexpected adverse reactions which are not serious, whether occurring in the Community or in a third country, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 87(2).
Save in exceptional circumstances, these reactions shall be transmitted electronically in the form of a report and in accordance with the guide referred to in Article 51.
3. The holder of the marketing authorisation for a veterinary medicinal product shall maintain detailed records of all suspected adverse reactions occurring within or outside the Community which are reported to him.
Unless other requirements have been laid down as a condition for the granting of the marketing authorisation by the Community, these records shall be submitted, in the form of a periodic safety update report, to the Agency and Member States immediately upon request or at least every six months after authorisation until the placing on the market. Periodic safety update reports shall also be submitted immediately upon request or at least every six months during the first two years following the initial placing on the Community market and once a year for the following two years. Thereafter, the reports shall be submitted at three-yearly intervals, or immediately upon request.
These reports shall be accompanied by a scientific evaluation, particularly of the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product.
4. The Commission may lay down provisions to amend paragraph 3 in view of experience gained with its operation. The Commission shall adopt any such provisions in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 87(2).
5. The holder of a marketing authorisation may not communicate information relating to pharmacovigilance concerns to the general public in relation to its authorised medicinal product without giving prior or simultaneous notification to the Agency.
In any case, the marketing authorisation holder shall ensure that such information is presented objectively and is not misleading.
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that a marketing authorisation holder who fails to discharge these obligations is subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
