Article 7
Public service obligations
1.   Member States may decide to impose public service obligations related to port services on providers of port services and may entrust the right to impose such obligations to the managing body of the port, or to the competent authority, in order to ensure at least one of the following:
(a)
the availability of the port service to all port users, at all berths, without interruption, day and night, throughout the year;
(b)
the availability of the service to all users on equal terms;
(c)
the affordability of the service for certain categories of users;
(d)
the safety, security or environmental sustainability of port operations;
(e)
the provision of adequate transport services to the public; and
(f)
territorial cohesion.
2.   The public service obligations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be clearly defined, transparent, non-discriminatory and verifiable, and shall guarantee equality of access to all providers of port services established in the Union.
3.   Where a Member State decides to impose public service obligations for the same service in all its maritime ports covered by this Regulation, it shall notify those obligations to the Commission.
4.   In the event of a disruption of port services for which public service obligations are imposed or when an immediate risk of such a situation occurs, the managing body of the port, or the competent authority, may take an emergency measure. The emergency measure may take the form of a direct award so as to attribute the service to a different provider for a period of up to two years. During that period, the managing body of the port, or the competent authority, shall either launch a new procedure to select a provider of port services or shall apply Article 8. Collective industrial action that takes place in accordance with national law shall not be considered a disruption of port services for which an emergency measure may be taken.
