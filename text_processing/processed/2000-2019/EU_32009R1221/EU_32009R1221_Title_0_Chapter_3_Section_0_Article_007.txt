Article 7
Derogation for small organisations
1.   Competent Bodies shall, upon request of a small organisation, extend for that organisation the three-yearly frequency referred to in Article 6(1) up to four years or the annual frequency referred to in Article 6(2) up to two years, provided that the environmental verifier that has verified the organisation confirms that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
no significant environmental risks are present;
(b)
the organisation has no substantial changes planned as defined in Article 8, and
(c)
there exist no significant local environmental problems that the organisation contributes to.
To submit the request referred to in the first subparagraph, the organisation may use the form set out in Annex VI.
2.   The Competent Body shall refuse the request if the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are not met. It shall communicate a reasoned justification to the organisation.
3.   Organisations benefiting from an extension of up to two years, as referred to in paragraph 1, shall forward the non-validated updated environmental statement to the Competent Body each year that they are exempt from the obligation to have a validated updated environmental statement.
