Article 17
Peer evaluation of Competent Bodies
1.   A peer evaluation shall be organised by the Forum of Competent Bodies to assess conformity of the registration system of every Competent Body with this Regulation and to develop a harmonised approach to the application of the rules relating to registration.
2.   The peer evaluation shall be carried out on a regular basis and at least every four years, and shall include an assessment of the rules and procedures set out in Articles 12, 13 and 15. All Competent Bodies shall participate in the peer evaluation.
3.   The Commission shall establish procedures for carrying out the peer evaluation, including appropriate appeals procedures against decisions taken as a result of the peer evaluation.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 49(3).
4.   Procedures referred to in paragraph 3 shall be established before the first peer evaluation takes place.
5.   The Forum of Competent Bodies shall transmit a regular report of the peer evaluation to the Commission and the Committee established under Article 49(1).
That report shall be made publicly available after approval by the Forum of Competent Bodies and the Committee referred to in the first subparagraph.
