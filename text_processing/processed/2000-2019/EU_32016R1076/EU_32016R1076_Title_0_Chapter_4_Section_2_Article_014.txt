Article 14
Imposition of provisional safeguard measures
1.   Provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in critical circumstances where a delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, pursuant to a preliminary determination that any of the circumstances set out in Article 10 exist. Such provisional safeguard measures shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 19(4), or, in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 19(6).
2.   In view of the particular situation of outermost regions of the Union and their vulnerability to any surge in imports, provisional safeguard measures shall be applied in proceedings that concern them where a preliminary determination has shown that imports have increased. Those provisional safeguard measures shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 19(4), or, in cases of urgency, in accordance with Article 19(6).
3.   Where a Member State requests immediate intervention by the Commission and where the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 or 2 are met, the Commission shall take a decision within five working days of receipt of the request.
4.   Provisional safeguard measures may take the form of an increase in the customs duty on the product concerned up to a level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other WTO members, or tariff quotas.
5.   Provisional safeguard measures shall not apply for more than 180 days. Where provisional measures are restricted to outermost regions, they shall not apply for more than 200 days.
6.   If the provisional safeguard measures are repealed because the investigation shows that the conditions laid down in Articles 10 and 11 are not met, any duty collected as a result of those measures shall be refunded automatically.
