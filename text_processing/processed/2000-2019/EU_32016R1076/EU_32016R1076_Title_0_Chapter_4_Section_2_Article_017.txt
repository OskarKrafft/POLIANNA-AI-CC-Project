Article 17
Duration and review of safeguard measures
1.   A safeguard measure shall remain in force only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury or disturbances. That period shall not exceed two years, including the duration of any provisional measure, unless it is extended in accordance with paragraph 2. Where the measure is restricted to one or several of the outermost regions of the Union, the period of application may not exceed four years.
2.   The initial period of duration of a safeguard measure may exceptionally be extended provided that it is determined that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury or disturbances.
3.   Extensions shall be adopted in accordance with the procedures set out in this Regulation applicable to investigations using the same procedures as the initial measures.
The total duration of a safeguard measure may not exceed four years, including any provisional measure. In the event of a measure restricted to one or several of the outermost regions of the Union, that limit shall be extended to eight years.
4.   If the duration of a safeguard measure exceeds one year, it shall be progressively liberalised at regular intervals during its period of application, including any extension.
Consultations with the region or state concerned shall be held periodically in the appropriate institutional bodies set up under the relevant agreements, with a view to establishing a timetable for the abolition of safeguard measures as soon as circumstances permit.
