Article 20
Exceptional measures with limited territorial application
Where it emerges that the conditions laid down for the adoption of safeguard measures are met in one or more Member States, the Commission, after having examined alternative solutions, may exceptionally authorise the application of surveillance or safeguard measures restricted to the Member State or Member States concerned if it considers that such measures applied at that level are more appropriate than measures applied throughout the Union. Such measures shall be of a strictly limited duration and, insofar as possible, shall not disrupt the operation of the internal market.
