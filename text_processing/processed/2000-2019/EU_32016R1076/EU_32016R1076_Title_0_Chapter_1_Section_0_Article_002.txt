Article 2
Scope
1.   This Regulation applies to products originating in the regions and states listed in Annex I.
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 22 to amend Annex I in order to add regions or states from the ACP Group of States which have concluded negotiations on an agreement with the Union which at least meets the requirements of Article XXIV of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994).
3.   A region or state shall remain on the list in Annex I unless the Commission adopts a delegated act in accordance with Article 22 amending Annex I to remove that region or state from that Annex, in particular where:
(a)
the region or state indicates that it intends not to ratify an agreement which has permitted it to be included in Annex I;
(b)
ratification of an agreement which has permitted a region or state to be included in Annex I has not taken place within a reasonable period of time such that the entry into force of the agreement is unduly delayed; or
(c)
the agreement is terminated, or the region or state concerned terminates its rights and obligations under the agreement, but the agreement otherwise remains in force.
