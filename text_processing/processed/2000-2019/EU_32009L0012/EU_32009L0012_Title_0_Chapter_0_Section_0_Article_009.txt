Quality standards
1.   In order to ensure smooth and efficient operations at an airport, Member States shall take the necessary measures to allow the airport managing body and the representatives or associations of airport users at the airport to enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a service level agreement with regard to the quality of service provided at the airport. These negotiations on service quality may take place as part of the consultations referred to in Article 6(1).
