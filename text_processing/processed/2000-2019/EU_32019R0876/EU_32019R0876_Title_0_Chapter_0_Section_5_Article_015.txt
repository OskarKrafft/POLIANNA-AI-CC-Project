(a)
the standardised approach referred to in paragraph 2;
(b)
the internal model approach set out in Chapter 5 of this Title for those risk categories for which the institution has been granted permission in accordance with Article 363 to use that approach.
2.   The own funds requirements for market risk calculated in accordance with the standardised approach referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall mean the sum of the following own funds requirements, as applicable:
(a)
the own funds requirements for position risk referred to in Chapter 2;
(b)
the own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk referred to in Chapter 3;
(c)
the own funds requirements for commodity risk referred to in Chapter 4.
3.   An institution that is not exempted from the reporting requirements set out in Article 430b in accordance with Article 325a shall report the calculation in accordance with Article 430b for all trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk in accordance with the following approaches:
(a)
the alternative standardised approach set out in Chapter 1a;
(b)
the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b.
4.   An institution may use in combination the approaches set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article on a permanent basis within a group in accordance with Article 363.
5.   Institutions shall not use the approach set out in point (b) of paragraph 3 for instruments in their trading book that are securitisation positions or positions included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP) as set out in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8.
6.   Securitisation positions and nth-to-default credit derivatives that meet all the following criteria shall be included in the ACTP:

Article 325d
Definitions
For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions apply:
(1)
‘risk class’ means one of the following seven categories:
(i)
general interest rate risk;
(ii)
credit spread risk (CSR) for non-securitisation;
(iii)
credit spread risk for securitisation not included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (non-ACTP CSR);
(iv)
credit spread risk for securitisation included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP CSR);
(v)
equity risk;
(vi)
commodity risk;
(vii)
foreign exchange risk;
(2)
‘sensitivity’ means the relative change in the value of a position, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of the position, calculated with the institution's pricing model in accordance with Subsection 2 of Section 3;
(3)
‘bucket’ means a sub-category of positions within one risk class with a similar risk profile to which a risk weight as defined in Subsection 1 of Section 3 is assigned.
Article 325e
Components of the sensitivities-based method
1.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for market risk under the sensitivities-based method by aggregating the following three own funds requirements in accordance with Article 325h:
(a)
own funds requirements for delta risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its non-volatility related risk factors;
(b)
own funds requirements for vega risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in its volatility-related risk factors;
(c)
own funds requirements for curvature risk which capture the risk of changes in the value of an instrument due to movements in the main non-volatility related risk factors not captured by the own funds requirements for delta risk.
2.   For the purpose of the calculation referred to in paragraph 1,
(a)
all the positions of instruments with optionality shall be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1;
(b)
all the positions of instruments without optionality shall only be subject to the own funds requirements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1.
For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments with optionality include, among others: calls, puts, caps, floors, swap options, barrier options and exotic options. Embedded options, such as prepayment or behavioural options, shall be considered to be stand-alone positions in options for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk.
For the purposes of this Chapter, instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of the underlying's notional amount shall be considered to be instruments without optionality.
Article 325f
Own funds requirements for delta and vega risks
1.   Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in Subsection 1 of Section 3 to calculate the own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.
2.   Institutions shall apply the process set out in paragraphs 3 to 8 to calculate own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.
3.   For each risk class, the sensitivity of all instruments in scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risks to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulas in Subsection 2 of Section 3. If the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor.
4.   Sensitivities shall be assigned to one of the buckets ‘b’ within each risk class.
5.   Within each bucket ‘b’, the positive and negative sensitivities to the same risk factor shall be netted, giving rise to net sensitivities (sk) to each risk factor k within a bucket.
6.   The net sensitivities to each risk factor within each bucket shall be multiplied by the corresponding risk weights set out in Section 6, giving rise to weighted sensitivities to each risk factor within that bucket in accordance with the following formula:
 
WSk = RWk · sk

where:
WSk

=
the weighted sensitivities;
RWk

=
the risk weights; and
sk

=
the risk factor.
7.   The weighted sensitivities to the different risk factors within each bucket shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, where the quantity within the square root function is floored at zero, giving rise to the bucket-specific sensitivity. The corresponding correlations for weighted sensitivities within the same bucket (ρkl), set out in Section 6, shall be used.
 





where:
Kb

=
the bucket-specific sensitivity; and
WS
=
the weighted sensitivities.
8.   The bucket-specific sensitivity shall be calculated for each bucket within a risk class in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7. Once the bucket-specific sensitivity has been calculated for all buckets, weighted sensitivities to all risk factors across buckets shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, using the corresponding correlations γbc for weighted sensitivities in different buckets set out in Section 6, giving rise to the risk-class specific own funds requirement for delta or vega risk:





where:
Sb

=
Σk WSk for all risk factors in bucket b and Sc = Σk WSk in bucket c; where those values for Sb and Sc produce a negative number for the overall sum of

, the institution shall calculate the risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta or vega risk using an alternative specification whereby
Sb

=
max [min (Σk WSk, Kb), – Kb] for all risk factors in bucket b and
Sc

=
max [min (Σk WSk, Kc), – Kc] for all risk factors in bucket c.
The risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta or vega risk shall be calculated for each risk class in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 8.
Article 325g
Own funds requirements for curvature risk
Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for curvature risk in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.
Article 325h
Aggregation of risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks
1.   Institutions shall aggregate risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks in accordance with the process set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.
2.   The process to calculate the risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks described in Articles 325f and 325g shall be performed three times per risk class, each time using a different set of correlation parameters ρkl (correlation between risk factors within a bucket) and γbc (correlation between buckets within a risk class). Each of those three sets shall correspond to a different scenario, as follows:
(a)
the medium correlations scenario, whereby the correlation parameters ρkl and γbc remain unchanged from those specified in Section 6;
(b)
the high correlations scenario, whereby the correlation parameters ρkl and γbc that are specified in Section 6 shall be uniformly multiplied by 1,25, with ρkl and γbc subject to a cap at 100 %;
(c)
the low correlations scenario shall be specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.
3.   Institutions shall calculate the sum of the delta, vega and curvature risk-class specific own funds requirements for each scenario to determine three scenario-specific, own funds requirements.
4.   The own funds requirement under the sensitivities-based method shall be the highest of the three scenario-specific own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 3.
Article 325i
Treatment of index instruments and multi-underlying options
Institutions shall treat the index instruments and multi-underlying options in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.
Article 325j
Treatment of collective investment undertakings
Institutions shall treat the collective investment undertakings in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.
Article 325k
Underwriting positions
1.   Institutions may use the process set out in this Article for calculating the own funds requirements for market risk of underwriting positions of debt or equity instruments.
2.   Institutions shall apply one of the appropriate multiplying factors listed in Table 1 to the net sensitivities of all the underwriting positions in each individual issuer, excluding the underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of formal agreements, and calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the approach set out in this Chapter on the basis of the adjusted net sensitivities.

Risk factor definitions


Article 325l
General interest rate risk factors
1.   For all general interest rate risk factors, including inflation risk and cross-currency basis risk, there shall be one bucket per currency, each containing different types of risk factor.
The delta general interest rate risk factors applicable to interest rate-sensitive instruments shall be the relevant risk-free rates per currency and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall assign risk factors to the specified vertices by linear interpolation or by using a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the independent risk control function of the institution to report market risk or profits and losses to senior management.
2.   Institutions shall obtain the risk-free rates per currency from money market instruments held in the trading book of the institution that have the lowest credit risk, such as overnight index swaps.
3.   Where institutions cannot apply the approach referred to in paragraph 2, the risk-free rates shall be based on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark positions to market, such as the interbank offered rate swap curves.
Where the data on market-implied swap curves described in paragraph 2 and the first subparagraph of this paragraph are insufficient, the risk-free rates may be derived from the most appropriate sovereign bond curve for a given currency.
Where institutions use the general interest rate risk factors derived in accordance with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph for sovereign debt instruments, the sovereign debt instrument shall not be exempted from the own funds requirements for credit spread risk. In those cases, where it is not possible to disentangle the risk-free rate from the credit spread component, the sensitivity to the risk factor shall be allocated both to the general interest rate risk and to credit spread risk classes.
4.   In the case of general interest rate risk factors, each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Institutions shall assign risk factors within the same bucket, but with different maturities, a different risk weight, in accordance with Section 6.
Institutions shall apply additional risk factors for inflation risk to debt instruments whose cash flows are functionally dependent on inflation rates. Those additional risk factors shall consist of one vector of market-implied inflation rates of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are inflation rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.
5.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the additional risk factor for inflation risk referred to in paragraph 4 as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket, institutions shall treat inflation as a single risk factor, regardless of the number of components of each vector. Institutions shall offset all sensitivities to inflation within a bucket, calculated as described in this paragraph, in order to give rise to a single net sensitivity per bucket.
6.   Debt instruments that involve payments in different currencies shall also be subject to cross-currency basis risk between those currencies. For the purposes of the sensitivities-based method, the risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be the cross-currency basis risk of each currency over either US dollar or euro. Institutions shall compute cross currency bases that do not relate to either basis over US dollar or basis over euro either on ‘basis over US dollar’ or ‘basis over euro’.
Each cross-currency basis risk factor shall consist of one vector of cross-currency basis of different maturities per currency. For each debt instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are cross-currency bases used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket.
Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the cross-currency basis risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket there shall be two possible distinct risk factors: basis over euro and basis over US dollar, regardless of the number of components there are in each cross-currency basis vector. The maximum number of net sensitivities per bucket shall be two.
7.   The vega general interest rate risk factors applicable to options with underlyings that are sensitive to general interest rate shall be the implied volatilities of the relevant risk-free rates as described in paragraphs 2 and 3, which shall be assigned to buckets depending on the currency and mapped to the following maturities within each bucket: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be one bucket per currency.
For netting purposes, institutions shall consider implied volatilities linked to the same risk-free rates and mapped to the same maturities to constitute the same risk factor.
Where institutions map implied volatilities to the maturities as referred to in this paragraph, the following requirements shall apply:
(a)
where the maturity of the option is aligned with the maturity of the underlying, a single risk factor shall be considered, which shall be mapped to that maturity;
(b)
where the maturity of the option is shorter than the maturity of the underlying, the following risk factors shall be considered as follows:
(i)
the first risk factor shall be mapped to the maturity of the option;
(ii)
the second risk factor shall be mapped to the residual maturity of the underlying of the option at the expiry date of the option.
8.   The curvature general interest rate risk factors to be applied by institutions shall consist of one vector of risk-free rates, representing a specific risk-free yield curve, per currency. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of risk-free rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.
9.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors corresponding to different yield curves and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same currency. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the same risk factor. There shall be only one net sensitivity per bucket.
There shall be no curvature risk own funds requirements for inflation and cross currency basis risks.
Article 325m
Credit spread risk factors for non-securitisation
1.   The delta credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the issuer credit spread rates of those instruments, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and mapped to each of the following maturities: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall apply one risk factor per issuer and maturity, regardless of whether those issuer credit spread rates are inferred from debt instruments or credit default swaps. The buckets shall be sector buckets, as referred to in Section 6, and each bucket shall include all the risk factors allocated to the relevant sector.
2.   The vega credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with non-securitisation underlyings that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the implied volatilities of the underlying's issuer credit spread rates inferred as laid down in paragraph 1, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation.
3.   The curvature credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments shall consist of one vector of credit spread rates, representing a credit spread curve specific to the issuer. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates used as variables in the institution's pricing model for that instrument. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation.
4.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred from either relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same issuer.
Article 325n

Institutions shall apply the credit spread risk factors referred to in paragraph 5 to securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(6), (7) and (8).
2.   The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for securitisations that are included in the ACTP shall be the same as the buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for non-securitisations, as referred to in Section 6.
The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for securitisations that are not included in the ACTP shall be specific to that risk-class category, as referred to in Section 6.
3.   The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP are the following:
(a)
the delta risk factors shall be all the relevant credit spread rates of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and for each of the following maturities: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.
(b)
the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred as described in point (a) of this paragraph, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the corresponding option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.
(c)
the curvature risk factors shall be the relevant credit spread yield curves of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position expressed as a vector of credit spread rates for different maturities, inferred as indicated in point (a) of this paragraph; for each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.
4.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the securitisation position to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula as specified in Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred either from relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same issuer.
5.   The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP shall refer to the spread of the tranche rather than the spread of the underlying instruments and shall be the following:
(a)
the delta risk factors shall be the relevant tranche credit spread rates, mapped to the following maturities, in accordance with the maturity of the tranche: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years;
(b)
the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the tranches, each of them mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years;
(c)
the curvature risk factors shall be the same as those described in point (a) of this paragraph; to all those risk factors, a common risk weight shall be applied, as referred to in Section 6.
Article 325o
Equity risk factors
1.   The buckets for all equity risk factors shall be the sector buckets referred to in Section 6.
2.   The equity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be all the equity spot prices and all equity repo rates.
For the purposes of equity risk, a specific equity repo curve shall constitute a single risk factor, which is expressed as a vector of repo rates for different maturities. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of repo rates that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.
Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of an instrument to an equity risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the repo rate risk factor of the same equity security, regardless of the number of components of each vector.
3.   The equity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to equity shall be the implied volatilities of equity spot prices which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be no own funds requirements for vega risk for equity repo rates.
4.   The equity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to equity are all the equity spot prices, regardless of the maturity of the corresponding options. There shall be no curvature risk own funds requirements for equity repo rates.
Article 325p
Commodity risk factors
1.   The buckets for all commodity risk factors shall be the sector buckets referred to in Section 6.
2.   The commodity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions to commodity sensitive instruments shall be all the commodity spot prices per commodity type and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall only consider two commodity prices of the same type of commodity, and with the same maturity to constitute the same risk factor where the set of legal terms regarding the delivery location are identical.
3.   The commodity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be the implied volatilities of commodity prices per commodity type, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall consider sensitivities to the same commodity type and allocated to the same maturity to be a single risk factor which institutions shall then offset.
4.   The commodity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be one set of commodity prices with different maturities per commodity type, expressed as a vector. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are prices of that commodity that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Institutions shall not differentiate between commodity prices by delivery location.
The sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula shall be calculated as specified in Article 325g. For the purposes of curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors having a different number of components to constitute the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same commodity type.
Article 325q
Foreign exchange risk factors
1.   The foreign exchange delta risk factors to be applied by institutions to foreign exchange sensitive instruments shall be all the spot exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the institution's reporting currency. There shall be one bucket per currency pair, containing a single risk factor and a single net sensitivity.
2.   The foreign exchange vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to foreign exchange shall be the implied volatilities of exchange rates between the currency pairs referred to in paragraph 1. Those implied volatilities of exchange rates shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.
3.   The foreign exchange curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to foreign exchange shall be the same as those referred to in paragraph 1.
4.   Institutions shall not be required to distinguish between onshore and offshore variants of a currency for all foreign exchange delta, vega and curvature risk factors.

Article 325t
Requirements on sensitivity computations
1.   Institutions shall derive sensitivities from the institution's pricing models that serve as a basis for reporting profit and loss to senior management, using the formulas set out in this Subsection.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, competent authorities may require an institution that has been granted permission to use the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b to use the pricing functions of the risk-measurement system of their internal model approach in the calculation of sensitivities under this Chapter for the calculation and reporting of the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 430b(3).
2.   When calculating delta risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (a) of Article 325e(2), institutions may assume that the implied volatility risk factors remain constant.
3.   When calculating vega risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (b) of Article 325e(2), the following requirements shall apply:
(a)
for general interest rate risk and credit spread risk, institutions shall assume, for each currency, that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows either a lognormal or normal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments;
(b)
for equity risk, commodity risk and foreign exchange risk, institutions shall assume that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows a lognormal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments.
4.   Institutions shall calculate all sensitivities except for the sensitivities to credit valuation adjustments.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, an institution may use alternative definitions of delta risk sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets all the following conditions:
(a)
those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes and for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;
(b)
the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities for the position than are the formulas set out in this Subsection, and that the resulting sensitivities do not materially differ from those formulas.
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, an institution may calculate vega sensitivities on the basis of a linear transformation of alternative definitions of sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets both the following conditions:
(a)
those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes and for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;
(b)
the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities for the position than are the formulas set out in this Subsection, and that the linear transformation referred to in the first subparagraph reflects a vega risk sensitivity.
Article 325u
Own funds requirements for residual risks
1.   In addition to the own funds requirements for market risk set out in Section 2, institutions shall apply additional own funds requirements to instruments exposed to residual risks in accordance with this Article.
2.   Instruments are considered to be exposed to residual risks where they meet any of the following conditions:
(a)
the instrument references an exotic underlying, which, for the purposes of this Chapter, means a trading book instrument referencing an underlying exposure that is not in the scope of the delta, vega or curvature risk treatments under the sensitivities-based method laid down in Section 2 or the own funds requirements for the default risk set out in Section 5;
(b)
the instrument is an instrument bearing other residual risks, which, for the purposes of this Chapter, means any of the following instruments:
(i)
instruments that are subject to the own funds requirements for vega and curvature risk under the sensitivities-based method set out in Section 2 and that generate pay-offs that cannot be replicated as a finite linear combination of plain-vanilla options with a single underlying equity price, commodity price, exchange rate, bond price, credit default swap price or interest rate swap;
(ii)
instruments that are positions that are included in the ACTP referred to in Article 325(6); hedges that are included in that ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(8), shall not be considered.
3.   Institutions shall calculate the additional own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 1 as the sum of gross notional amounts of the instruments referred to in paragraph 2, multiplied by the following risk weights:
(a)
1,0 % in the case of instruments referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2;
(b)
0,1 % in the case of instruments referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2.
4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institution shall not apply the own funds requirement for residual risks to an instrument that meets any of the following conditions:
(a)
the instrument is listed on a recognised exchange;
(b)
the instrument is eligible for central clearing in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;
(c)
the instrument perfectly offsets the market risk of another position in the trading book, in which case the two perfectly matching trading book positions shall be exempted from the own funds requirement for residual risks.
5.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what an exotic underlying is and which instruments are instruments bearing residual risks for the purposes of paragraph 2.
When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall examine whether longevity risk, weather, natural disasters and future realised volatility should be considered as exotic underlyings.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2021.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325v
Definitions and general provisions
1.   For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply:
(a)
‘short exposure’ means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a gain for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;
(b)
‘long exposure’ means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a loss for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;
(c)
‘gross jump-to-default (gross JTD) amount’ means the estimated size of the loss or gain that the default of the obligor would produce for a specific exposure;
(d)
‘net jump-to-default (net JTD) amount’ means the estimated size of the loss or gain that an institution would incur due to the default of an obligor, after offsetting between gross JTD amounts has taken place,
(e)
‘loss given default’ or ‘LGD’ means the loss given default of the obligor on an instrument issued by that obligor expressed as a share of the notional amount of the instrument;
(f)
‘default risk weight’ means the percentage representing the estimated probability of the default of each obligor, according to the creditworthiness of that obligor.
2.   Own funds requirements for the default risk shall apply to debt and equity instruments, to derivative instruments having those instruments as underlyings and to derivatives, the pay-offs or fair values of which are affected by the default of an obligor other than the counterparty to the derivative instrument itself. Institutions shall calculate default risk requirements separately for each of the following types of instruments: non-securitisations, securitisations that are not included in the ACTP, and securitisations that are included in the ACTP. The final own funds requirements for the default risk to be applied by institutions shall be the sum of those three components.

Subsection 1



Own funds requirements for the default risk for non-securitisations


Article 325w
Gross jump-to-default amounts
1.   Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each long exposure to debt instruments as follows:
 
JTDlong = max {LGD Vnotional + P&Llong + Adjustmentlong; 0}
where:
JTDlong

=
the gross JTD amount for the long exposure;
Vnotional

=
the notional amount of the instrument;
P&Llong

=
a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the long exposure; gains shall enter the formula with a positive sign and losses with a negative; and
Adjustmentlong

=
the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's loss in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; increases shall enter the Adjustmentlong term with a positive sign and decreases with a negative sign.
2.   Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each short exposure to debt instruments as follows:
 
JTDshort = min {LGD Vnotional + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}
where:
JTDshort

=
the gross JTD amount for the short exposure;
Vnotional

=
the notional amount of the instrument that shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;
P&Lshort

=
a term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the short exposure; gains shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and losses shall enter into the formula with a negative sign; and
Adjustmentshort

=
the amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's gain in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; decreases shall enter the Adjustmentshort term with a positive sign and increases shall enter the Adjustmentshort term with a negative sign.
3.   For the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the LGD for debt instruments to be applied by institutions shall be the following:
(a)
exposures to non-senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 100 %;
(b)
exposures to senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 75 %;
(c)
exposures to covered bonds, as referred to in Article 129, shall be assigned an LGD of 25 %.
4.   For the purposes of the calculations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, notional amounts shall be determined as follows:
(a)
in the case of debt instruments, the notional amount is the face value of the debt instrument;
(b)
in the case of derivative instruments with debt security underlyings, the notional amount is the notional amount of the derivative instrument.
5.   For exposures to equity instruments, institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts as follows, instead of using the formulas referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:
 
JTDlong = max {LGD · V + P&Llong + Adjustmentlong; 0}
 
JTDshort = min {LGD · V + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}
where:
JTDlong

=
the gross JTD amount for the long exposure;
JTDshort

=
the gross JTD amount for the short exposure; and
V
=
the fair value of the equity or, in the case of derivative instruments with equity underlyings, the fair value of the equity underlying.
6.   Institutions shall assign an LGD of 100 % to equity instruments for the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraph 5.
7.   In the case of exposures to default risk arising from derivative instruments whose pay-offs in the event of default of the obligor are not related to the notional amount of a specific instrument issued by that obligor or to the LGD of the obligor or an instrument issued by that obligor, institutions shall use alternative methodologies to estimate the gross JTD amounts.
8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
how institutions are to calculate JTD amounts for different types of instruments in accordance with this Article;
(b)
which alternative methodologies institutions are to use for the purposes of the estimation of gross JTD amounts referred to in paragraph 7.
(c)
the notional amounts of instruments other than the ones referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2021.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325x
Net jump-to-default amounts
1.   Institutions shall calculate net JTD amounts by offsetting the gross JTD amounts of short exposures and long exposures. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures to the same obligor where the short exposures have the same seniority as, or lower seniority than, the long exposures.
2.   Offsetting shall be either full or partial, depending on the maturities of the offsetting exposures:
(a)
offsetting shall be full where all offsetting exposures have maturities of one year or more;
(b)
offsetting shall be partial where at least one of the offsetting exposures has a maturity of less than one year, in which case the size of the JTD amount of each exposure with a maturity of less than one year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the exposure's maturity relative to one year.
3.   Where no offsetting is possible gross JTD amounts shall equal net JTD amounts in the case of exposures with maturities of one year or more. Gross JTD amounts with maturities of less than one year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the exposure's maturity relative to one year, with a floor of three months, to calculate net JTD amounts.
4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the maturities of the derivative contracts shall be considered, rather than those of their underlyings. Cash equity exposures shall be assigned a maturity of either one year or three months, at the institution's discretion.
Article 325y
Calculation of the own funds requirements for the default risk
1.   Net JTD amounts, irrespective of the type of counterparty, shall be multiplied by the default risk weights that correspond to their credit quality, as specified in Table 2:

Table 2

2.   Exposures which would receive a 0 % risk-weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II shall receive a 0 % default risk weight for the own funds requirements for the default risk.
3.   The weighted net JTD shall be allocated to the following buckets: corporates, sovereigns, and local governments/municipalities.
4.   Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket, in accordance with the following formula:
 
DRCb = max {(Σi ∈ long RWi · net JTDi) – WtS · (Σi ∈ short RWi · |net JTDi|); 0}
where:
DRCb

=
the own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b;
i
=
the index that denotes an instrument belonging to bucket b;
RWi

=
the risk weight; and
WtS
=
a ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated as follows:
For the purposes of calculating the DRCb and the WtS, the long positions and short positions shall be aggregated for all positions within a bucket, regardless of the credit quality step to which those positions are allocated, to produce the bucket-specific own funds requirements for the default risk.
5.   The final own funds requirement for the default risk for non-securitisations shall be calculated as the simple sum of the bucket-level own funds requirements.

Subsection 2



Own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP


Article 325z
Jump-to-default amounts
1.   Gross jump-to-default amounts for securitisation exposures shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.
2.   Net jump-to-default amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross jump-to-default amounts and short gross jump-to-default amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between securitisation exposures with the same underlying asset pool and belonging to the same tranche. No offsetting shall be permitted between securitisation exposures with different underlying asset pools, even where the attachment and detachment points are the same.
3.   Where, by decomposing or combining existing securitisation exposures, other existing securitisation exposures can be perfectly replicated, except for the maturity dimension, the exposures resulting from that decomposition or combination may be used instead of the existing securitisation exposures for the purposes of offsetting.
4.   Where, by decomposing or combining existing exposures in underlying names, the entire tranche structure of an existing securitisation exposure can be perfectly replicated, the exposures resulting from that decomposition or combination may be used instead of the existing securitisation exposures for the purposes of offsetting. Where underlying names are used in that manner, they shall be removed from the non-securitisation default risk treatment.
5.   Article 325x shall apply to both existing securitisation exposures and to securitisation exposures used in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article. The relevant maturities shall be those of the securitisation tranches.
Article 325aa
Calculation of the own funds requirement for the default risk for securitisations
1.   Net JTD amounts of securitisation exposures shall be multiplied by 8 % of the risk weight that applies to the relevant securitisation exposure, including STS securitisations, in the non-trading book in accordance with the hierarchy of approaches set out in Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II and irrespective of the type of counterparty.
2.   A maturity of one year shall be applied to all tranches, where risk weights are calculated in accordance with the SEC-IRBA and SEC-ERBA.
3.   The risk-weighted JTD amounts for individual cash securitisation exposures shall be capped at the fair value of the position.
4.   Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to the following buckets:
(a)
one common bucket for all corporates, regardless of the region;
(b)
44 different buckets corresponding to one bucket per region for each of the 11 asset classes defined in the second subparagraph.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the 11 asset classes are ABCP, auto loans/leases, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), credit cards, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), collateralised loan obligations, collateralised debt obligations squared (CDO-squared), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), student loans, other retail, other wholesale. The four regions are Asia, Europe, North America, and rest of the world.
5.   In order to assign a securitisation exposure to a bucket, institutions shall rely on a classification commonly used in the market. Institutions shall assign each securitisation exposure to only one of the buckets referred to in paragraph 4. Any securitisation exposure that an institution cannot assign to a bucket for an asset class or region shall be assigned to the asset class ‘other retail’ or ‘other wholesale’ or to the region ‘rest of the world’, respectively.
6.   Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in the same manner as for default risk of non-securitisation exposures, using the formula in Article 325y(4), resulting in the own funds requirement for the default risk for each bucket.
7.   The final own funds requirement for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP shall be calculated as the simple sum of the bucket-level own funds requirements.

Subsection 3



Own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations included in the ACTP


Article 325ab
Scope
1.   For the ACTP, the own funds requirements shall include the default risk for securitisation exposures and for non-securitisation hedges. Those hedges shall be removed from the default risk calculations for non-securitisation. There shall be no diversification benefit between the own funds requirements for the default risk for non-securitisations, the own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP and own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations included in the ACTP.
2.   For traded non-securitisation credit and equity derivatives, JTD amounts by individual constituents shall be determined by applying a look-through approach.
Article 325ac
Jump-to-default amounts for the ACTP
1.   For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:
(a)
‘decomposition with a valuation model’ means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with an LGD of 100 %;
(b)
‘replication’ means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series;
(c)
‘decomposition’ means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index.
2.   The gross JTD amounts for securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures in the ACTP shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.
3.   Nth-to-default products shall be treated as tranched products with the following attachment and detachment points:
(a)
attachment point = (N – 1) / Total Names;
(b)
detachment point = N / Total Names;
where ‘Total Names’ shall be the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool.
4.   Net JTD amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures that are otherwise identical except for maturity. Offsetting shall only be possible as follows:
(a)
for indices, index tranches and bespoke tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche, subject to the provisions on exposures of less than one year laid down in Article 325x; long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts that perfectly replicate each other may be offset through decomposition into single name equivalent exposures using a valuation model; in such cases, the sum of the gross JTD amounts of the single name equivalent exposures obtained through decomposition shall be equal to the gross JTD amount of the undecomposed exposure;
(b)
offsetting through decomposition as set out is point (a) shall not be allowed for resecuritisations or derivatives on securitisation;
(c)
for indices and index tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche by replication or by decomposition; where the long exposures and short exposures are otherwise equivalent, apart from one residual component, offsetting shall be allowed and the net JTD amount shall reflect the residual exposure;
(d)
different tranches of the same index series, different series of the same index and different index families may not be used to offset each other.
Article 325ad
Calculation of the own funds requirements for the default risk for the ACTP
1.   Net JTD amounts shall be multiplied by:
(a)
for tranched products, the default risk weights corresponding to their credit quality as specified in Article 325y(1) and (2);
(b)

 shall be set in accordance with paragraph 1.
3.   With regard to vega risk sensitivities between buckets within a risk class (GIRR and non-GIRR), the same correlation parameters for γbc, as specified for delta correlations for each risk class in Section 4, shall be used in the vega risk context.
4.   There shall be no diversification or hedging benefit recognised in the standardised approach between vega risk factors and delta risk factors. Vega risk charges and delta risk charges shall be aggregated by simple summation.
5.   The curvature risk correlations shall be the square of corresponding delta risk correlations ρkl and γbc referred to in Subsection 1.

CHAPTER 1b



Alternative internal model approach


Article 325az
Alternative internal model approach and permission to use alternative internal models
1.   The alternative internal model approach as set out in this Chapter shall be used only for the purposes of the reporting requirement laid down in Article 430b(3).
2.   After having verified institutions' compliance with the requirements set out in Articles 325bh, 325bi and 325bj, competent authorities shall grant permission to those institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for the portfolio of all positions assigned to trading desks by using their alternative internal models in accordance with Article 325ba, provided that all the following requirements are met:
(a)
the trading desks were established in accordance with Article 104b;
(b)
the institution has provided to the competent authority a rationale for the inclusion of the trading desks in the scope of the alternative internal model approach;
(c)
the trading desks have met the back-testing requirements referred to in Article 325bf(3) for the preceding year;
(d)
the institution has reported to its competent authorities the results of the profit and loss attribution (‘P&L attribution’) requirement for the trading desks set out in Article 325bg;
(e)
for trading desks that have been assigned at least one of those trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl, the trading desks fulfil the requirements set out in Article 325bm for the internal default risk model;
(f)
no securitisation or re-securitisation positions have been assigned to the trading desks.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, not including a trading desk in the scope of the alternative internal model approach shall not be motivated by the fact that the own funds requirement calculated under the alternative standardised approach set out in point (a) of Article 325(3) would be lower than the own funds requirement calculated under the alternative internal model approach.
3.   Institutions that have received the permission to use the alternative internal model approach shall report to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 430b(3).
4.   An institution that has been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 2 shall immediately notify its competent authorities that one of its trading desks no longer meets at least one of the requirements set out in that paragraph. That institution shall no longer be permitted to apply this Chapter to any of the positions assigned to that trading desk and shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the approach set out in Chapter 1a for all the positions assigned to that trading desk from the earliest reporting date and until the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the trading desk again fulfils all the requirements set out in paragraph 2.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, in extraordinary circumstances, competent authorities may permit an institution to continue using its alternative internal models for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for the market risk of a trading desk that no longer meets the conditions referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article and in Article 325bg(1). When competent authorities exercise that discretion, they shall notify EBA and substantiate their decision.
6.   For positions assigned to the trading desks for which an institution has not been granted permission as referred to in paragraph 2, the own funds requirements for market risk shall be calculated by that institution in accordance with Chapter 1a of this Title. For the purposes of that calculation, all those positions shall be considered on a stand-alone basis as a separate portfolio.
7.   Material changes to the use of alternative internal models that an institution has received permission to use, the extension of the use of alternative internal models that the institution has received permission to use, and material changes to the institution's choice of the subset of the modellable risk factors referred to in Article 325bc(2), shall require separate permission from its competent authorities.
Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of all other extensions and changes to the use of the alternative internal models for which the institution has received permission.
8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes to the use of alternative internal models and changes to the subset of the modellable risk factors referred to in Article 325bc;
(b)
the assessment methodology under which competent authorities verify an institution's compliance with the requirements set out in Articles 325bh, 325bi, 325bn, 325bo and 325bp.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2024.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
9.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the extraordinary circumstances under which competent authorities may permit an institution:
(a)
to continue using its alternative internal models for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for the market risk of a trading desk that no longer meets the conditions referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article and in Article 325bg(1);
(b)
to limit the add-on to the one resulting from overshootings under back-testing hypothetical changes.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2024.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325ba
Own funds requirements when using alternative internal models
1.   An institution using an alternative internal model shall calculate the own funds requirements for the portfolio of all positions assigned to the trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) as the higher of the following:
(a)
the sum of the following values:
(i)
the institution's previous day's expected shortfall risk measure, calculated in accordance with Article 325bb (ESt-1), and
(ii)
the institution's previous day's stress scenario risk measure, calculated in accordance with Section 5 (SSt-1); or
(b)
the sum of the following values:
(i)
the average of the institution's daily expected shortfall risk measure, calculated in accordance with Article 325bb for each of the preceding sixty business days (ESavg), multiplied by the multiplication factor (mc); and
(ii)
the average of the institution's daily stress scenario risk measure, calculated in accordance with Section 5 for each of the preceding sixty business days (SSavg).
2.   Institutions holding positions in traded debt and equity instruments that are included in the scope of the internal default risk model and assigned to the trading desks referred to in paragraph 1 shall fulfil an additional own funds requirement, expressed as the higher of the following values:

2.   For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures 

 and 

 referred to in Article 325bb(1), in addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall meet the following requirements:
(a)










An institution that no longer meets the requirement referred to in the first paragraph of this point shall immediately notify the competent authorities thereof and shall update the subset of the modellable risk factors within two weeks in order to meet that requirement; where, after two weeks, that institution has failed to meet that requirement, the institution shall revert to the approach set out in Chapter 1a to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for some trading desks, until that institution is able to demonstrate to the competent authority that it is meeting the requirement set out in the first subparagraph of this point;
(b)





(c)





(d)





3.   For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures 

 and 

 referred to in Article 325bb(1), institutions shall, in addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, meet the following requirements:
(a)





(b)





(c)
the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of paragraph 4; those data shall be updated on at least a monthly basis.
4.   For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures 

 and 

 referred to in Article 325bb(1), institutions shall, in addition to the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, meet the following requirements:

(b)





(c)
the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be calibrated to historical data from the preceding 12-month period; where there is a significant upsurge in the price volatility of a material number of modellable risks factors of an institution's portfolio which are not in the subset of the risk factors referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may require an institution to use historical data for a period shorter than the preceding 12-months, but such a shorter period shall not be shorter than the preceding six-months; competent authorities shall notify EBA of any decision to require an institution to use historical data from a shorter period than 12 months and shall substantiate that decision.
5.   In calculating a given partial expected shortfall measure as referred to in Article 325bb(1), institutions shall maintain the values of the modellable risks factors for which they have not been required to apply scenarios of future shocks for that partial expected shortfall measure under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article.
Article 325bd
Liquidity horizons
1.   Institutions shall map each risk factor of positions assigned to the trading desks for which they have been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2), or for which they are in the process of being granted such permission, to one of the broad categories of risk factors listed in Table 2 and to one of the broad sub-categories of risk factors listed in that Table.
2.   The liquidity horizon of a risk factor of the positions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the liquidity horizon of the corresponding broad sub-category of risk factors to which it has been mapped.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, for a given trading desk, an institution may decide to replace the liquidity horizon of a broad sub-category of risk factors listed in Table 2 of this Article with one of the longer liquidity horizons listed in Table 1 of Article 325bc. Where an institution takes such a decision, the longer liquidity horizon shall apply to all the modellable risk factors of the positions assigned to that trading desk that have been mapped to that broad sub-category of risk factors for the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bc(1).
An institution shall notify the competent authorities of the trading desks and the broad sub-categories of risk factors to which it decides to apply the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph.
4.   For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bc(1), the effective liquidity horizon of a given modellable risk factor of a given trading book position shall be calculated as follows:
EffectiveLH =
 
SubCatLH if Mat > LH5

min (SubCatLH, minj{LHj/LHj ≥ Mat}) if LH1 ≤ Mat ≤ LH5

LH1 if Mat < LH1

where:
EffectiveLH
=
the effective liquidity horizon;
Mat
=
the maturity of the trading book position;
SubCatLH
=
the length of liquidity horizon of the modellable risk factor determined in accordance with paragraph 1; and

5.   Currency pairs that are composed of the euro and the currency of a Member State participating in ERM II shall be included in the most liquid currency pairs sub-category within the broad category of foreign exchange risk factor of Table 2.
6.   An institution shall verify the appropriateness of the mapping referred to in paragraph 1 on at least a monthly basis.
7.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
how institutions are to map the risk factors of the positions referred to in paragraph 1 to broad categories of risk factors and broad sub-categories of risk factors for the purposes of paragraph 1;
(b)
which currencies constitute the most liquid currencies sub-category of the broad category of interest rate risk factor of Table 2;
(c)
which currency pairs constitute the most liquid currency pairs sub-category of the broad category of foreign exchange risk factor of Table 2;
(d)
the definitions of small market capitalisation and large market capitalisation for the purposes of the equity price and volatility sub-category of the broad category of equity risk factor of Table 2.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Assessment of the modellability of risk factors
1.   Institutions shall assess the modellability of all the risk factors of the positions assigned to the trading desks for which they have been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) or are in the process of being granted such permission.
2.   As part of the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 325bk for those risk factors that are not modellable.
3.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria to assess the modellability of risk factors in accordance with paragraph 1 and to specify the frequency of that assessment.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325bf
Regulatory back-testing requirements and multiplication factors
1.   For the purposes of this Article, an ‘overshooting’ means a one-day change in the value of a portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated on the basis of the institution's alternative internal model in accordance with the following requirements:
(a)
the calculation of the value at risk shall be subject to a one-day holding period;
(b)
scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desk's positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;
(c)
data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);
(d)
unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's alternative internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1).
2.   Institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk.
3.   An institution's trading desk shall be deemed to meet the back-testing requirements where the number of overshootings for that trading desk that occurred over the most recent 250 business days does not exceed any of the following:
(a)
12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;
(b)
12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio;
(c)
30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;
(d)
30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.
4.   Institutions shall count daily overshootings in accordance with the following:
(a)
the back-testing of hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and, assuming unchanged positions, the value of the portfolio at the end of the subsequent day;
(b)
the back-testing of actual changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day, excluding fees and commissions;
(c)
an overshooting shall be counted for each business day for which the institution is not able to assess the value of the portfolio or is not able to calculate the value-at-risk number referred to in paragraph 3.
5.   An institution shall calculate, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article, the multiplication factor (mc) referred to in Article 325ba for the portfolio of all the positions assigned to the trading desks for which it has been granted permission to use alternative internal models as referred to in Article 325az(2).
6.   The multiplication factor (mc) shall be the sum of the value of 1,5 and an add-on between 0 and 0,5 in accordance with Table 3. For the portfolio referred to in paragraph 5, that add-on shall be calculated on the basis of the number of overshootings that occurred over the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution's back-testing of the value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph. The calculation of the add-on shall be subject to the following requirements:
(a)
an overshooting shall be a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by the institution's internal model in accordance with the following:
(i)
a one-day holding period;
(ii)
a 99th percentile, one tailed confidence interval;
(iii)
scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desks' positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;
(iv)
the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);
(v)
unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1);
(b)
the number of overshootings shall be equal to the greater of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.

In extraordinary circumstances, competent authorities may limit the add-on to that resulting from overshootings under back-testing hypothetical changes where the number of overshootings under back-testing actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model.
7.   Competent authorities shall monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 5 and the compliance of trading desks with the back-testing requirements referred to in paragraph 3. Institutions shall promptly notify, the competent authorities of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme and provide an explanation for those overshootings, and in any case shall notify the competent authorities thereof no later than within five business days after the occurrence of an overshooting.
8.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Article, competent authorities may permit an institution not to count an overshooting where a one-day change in the value of its portfolio that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by that institution's internal model is attributable to a non-modellable risk factor. To do so, the institution shall demonstrate to its competent authority that the stress scenario risk measure calculated in accordance with Article 325bk for that non-modellable risk factor is higher than the positive difference between the change in the value of the institution's portfolio and the related value-at-risk number.
9.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical elements to be included in the actual and hypothetical changes to the value of the portfolio of an institution for the purposes of this Article.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325bg
Profit and loss attribution requirement
1.   An institution's trading desk meets the P&L attribution requirements where that trading desk complies with the requirements set out in this Article.
2.   The P&L attribution requirement shall ensure that the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio, based on the institution's risk-measurement model, are sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of the trading desk's portfolio, based on the institution's pricing model.
3.   For each position of a given trading desk, an institution's compliance with the P&L attribution requirement shall lead to the identification of a precise list of risk factors that are deemed appropriate for verifying the institution's compliance with the back-testing requirement set out in Article 325bf.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
the criteria necessary to ensure that the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio is sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of paragraph 2, taking into account international regulatory developments;
(b)
the consequences for an institution where the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio are not sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of paragraph 2;
(c)
the frequency at which the P&L attribution is to be performed by an institution;
(d)
the technical elements to be included in the theoretical and hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of this Article;
(e)
the manner in which institutions that use the internal model are to aggregate the total own funds requirement for market risk for all their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk, taking into account the consequences referred to in point (b).
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325bh
Requirements on risk measurement
1.   Institutions using an internal risk-measurement model that is used to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk as referred to in Article 325ba shall ensure that that model meets all the following requirements:
(a)
the internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, which shall include at least the risk factors referred to in Subsection 1 of Section 3 of Chapter 1a unless the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the omission of those risk factors does not have a material impact on the results of the P&L attribution requirement referred to in Article 325bg; an institution shall be able to explain to the competent authorities why it has incorporated a risk factor in its pricing model but not in its internal risk-measurement model;
(b)
the internal risk-measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk;
(c)
the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate a set of risk factors that correspond to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance-sheet positions; the institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches; the yield curve shall be divided into various maturity segments to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve; for material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be modelled using a minimum of six maturity segments, and the number of risk factors used to model the yield curve shall be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the institution's trading strategies, the model shall also capture the risk spread of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves or different financial instruments on the same underlying issuer;
(d)
the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated; for CIUs, the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account; institutions may rely on third-party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, provided that the correctness of that report is adequately ensured; foreign exchange positions of a CIU of which an institution is not aware of shall be carved out from the internal models approach and treated in accordance with Chapter 1a;
(e)
the sophistication of the modelling technique shall be proportionate to the materiality of the institutions' activities in the equity markets; the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions and at least one risk factor that captures systemic movements in equity prices and the dependency of that risk factor on the individual risk factors for each equity market;
(f)
the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions, unless the institution has a small aggregate commodity position compared to all its trading activities, in which case it may use a separate risk factor for each broad commodity type; for material exposures to commodity markets, the model shall capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between commodities that are similar, but not identical, the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches, and the convenience yield between derivative and cash positions;
(g)
the proxies used shall show a good track record for the actual position held, shall be appropriately conservative, and shall be used only where the available data are insufficient, such as during the period of stress referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(2);
(h)
for material exposures to volatility risks in instruments with optionality, the internal risk-measurement model shall capture the dependency of implied volatilities across strike prices and options' maturities.
2.   Institutions may use empirical correlations within broad categories of risk factors and, for the purpose of calculating the unconstrained expected shortfall measure UESt as referred to in Article 325bb(1), across broad categories of risk factors only where the institution's approach for measuring those correlations is sound, consistent with the applicable liquidity horizons, and implemented with integrity.
3.   By 28 September 2020, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, specifying criteria for the use of data inputs in the risk-measurement model referred to in Article 325bc.
Article 325bi
Qualitative requirements
1.   Any internal risk-measurement model used for the purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound, shall be calculated and implemented with integrity, and shall comply with all the following qualitative requirements:
(a)
any internal risk-measurement model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk management process of the institution and shall serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;
(b)
an institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and that reports directly to senior management; that unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal risk-measurement model; that unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be responsible for the overall risk management system; that unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk, as well as reports on the appropriateness of measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;
(c)
the management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process, and the daily reports produced by the risk control unit shall be reviewed at a level of management with sufficient authority to require the reduction of positions taken by individual traders and to require the reduction of the institution's overall risk exposure;
(d)
the institution shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to the sophistication of the internal risk-measurement models, and a sufficient number of staff with skills in the trading, risk control, audit and back-office areas;
(e)
the institution shall have in place a documented set of internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the overall operation of its internal risk-measurement models;
(f)
any internal risk-measurement model, including any pricing model, shall have a proven track record of being reasonably accurate in measuring risks, and shall not differ significantly from the models that the institution uses for its internal risk management;
(g)
the institution shall frequently conduct rigorous programmes of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which shall encompass any internal risk-measurement model; the results of those stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management at least on a monthly basis and shall comply with the policies and limits approved by the management body; the institution shall take appropriate actions where the results of those stress tests show excessive losses arising from the trading's business of the institution under certain circumstances;
(h)
the institution shall conduct an independent review of its internal risk-measurement models, either as part of its regular internal auditing process, or by mandating a third-party undertaking to conduct that review, which shall be conducted to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.
For the purposes of point (h) of the first subparagraph, a third-party undertaking means an undertaking that provides auditing or consulting services to institutions and that has staff who have sufficient skills in the area of market risk in trading activities.
2.   The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and the independent risk control unit. The institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk management process at least once a year. That review shall assess the following:
(a)
the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process and the organisation of the risk control unit;
(b)
the integration of risk measures into daily risk management and the integrity of the management information system;
(c)
the processes the institution employs for approving the risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;
(d)
the scope of risks captured by the model, the accuracy and appropriateness of the risk-measurement system, and the validation of any significant changes to the internal risk-measurement model;
(e)
the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations, and the accuracy and appropriateness for generating data proxies where the available data are insufficient to meet the requirement set out in this Chapter;
(f)
the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of the data sources used to run any of its internal risk-measurement models, including the independence of those data sources;
(g)

(h)
where the review is performed by a third-party undertaking in accordance with point (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the verification that the internal validation process set out in Article 325bj fulfils its objectives.
3.   Institutions shall update the techniques and practices they use for any of the internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter to take into account the evolution of new techniques and best practices that develop in respect of those internal risk-measurement models.
Article 325bj
Internal validation
1.   Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that any internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties that are independent of the development process, in order to ensure that any such models are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks.
2.   Institutions shall conduct the validation referred to in paragraph 1 in the following circumstances:
(a)
when any internal risk-measurement model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to that model;
(b)
on a periodic basis, and where there have been significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal risk-measurement model no longer being adequate.
3.   The validation of the internal risk-measurement models of an institution shall not be limited to back-testing and P&L attribution requirements, but shall, at a minimum, include the following:
(a)
tests to verify whether the assumptions made in the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk;
(b)
own internal model validation tests, including back-testing in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios;
(c)
the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal risk-measurement model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example, material basis risks and concentration risk, or the risks associated with the use of proxies.
Article 325bk
Calculation of stress scenario risk measure
1.   The ‘stress scenario risk measure’ of a given non-modellable risk factor means the loss that is incurred in all trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange or commodity risk of the portfolio which includes that non-modellable risk factor when an extreme scenario of future shock is applied to that risk factor.
2.   Institutions shall develop appropriate extreme scenarios of future shock for all non-modellable risk factors, to the satisfaction of their competent authorities.
3.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
how institutions are to develop extreme scenarios of future shock applicable to non-modellable risk factors and how they are to apply those extreme scenarios of future shock to those risk factors;
(b)
a regulatory extreme scenario of future shock for each broad sub-category of risk factors listed in Table 2 of Article 325bd, which institutions may use when they are unable to develop an extreme scenario of future shock in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph, or which competent authorities may require that institution apply if those authorities are not satisfied with the extreme scenario of future shock developed by the institution;
(c)
the circumstances under which institutions may calculate a stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factor;
(d)
how institutions are to aggregate the stress scenario risk measures of all non-modellable risk factors included in their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk.
In developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into consideration the requirement that the level of own funds requirements for market risk of a non-modellable risk factor as set out in this Article shall be as high as the level of own funds requirements for market risk that would have been calculated under this Chapter if that risk factor were modellable.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 325bl
Scope of the internal default risk model
1.   All the positions of an institution that have been assigned to the trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) shall be subject to an own funds requirement for default risk where those positions contain at least one risk factor that has been mapped to the broad categories of ‘equity’ or ‘credit spread’ risk factors in accordance with Article 325bd(1). That own funds requirement, which is incremental to the risks captured by the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(1), shall be calculated using the institution's internal default risk model. That model which shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Section.
2.   For each of the positions referred to in paragraph 1, an institution shall identify one issuer of traded debt or equity instruments related to at least one risk factor.
Article 325bm
Permission to use an internal default risk model
1.   Competent authorities shall grant an institution permission to use an internal default risk model to calculate the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(2) for all the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl that are assigned to a trading desk for which the internal default risk model complies with the requirements set out in Articles 325bi, 325bj, 325bn, 325bo and 325bp.
2.   Where the trading desk of an institution, to which at least one of the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl has been assigned, does not meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, the own funds requirements for market risk of all positions in that trading desk shall be calculated in accordance with the approach set out in Chapter 1a.
Article 325bn
Own funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model
1.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model for the portfolio of all trading book positions as referred to in Article 325bl as follows:
(a)
the own funds requirements shall be equal to a value-at-risk number measuring potential losses in the market value of the portfolio caused by the default of issuers related to those positions at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a one-year time horizon;
(b)
the potential loss referred to in point (a) means a direct or indirect loss in the market value of a position which was caused by the default of the issuers and which is incremental to any losses already taken into account in the current valuation of the position; the default of the issuers of equity positions shall be represented by the value for the issuers' equity prices being set to zero;
(c)
institutions shall determine default correlations between different issuers on the basis of a conceptually sound methodology, using objective historical data on market credit spreads or equity prices that cover at least a 10 year period that includes the stress period identified by the institution in accordance with Article 325bc(2); the calculation of default correlations between different issuers shall be calibrated to a one-year time horizon;
(d)
the internal default risk model shall be based on a one-year constant position assumption.
2.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for default risk using an internal default risk model as referred to in paragraph 1 on at least a weekly basis.
3.   By way of derogation from points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1, an institution may replace the one-year time horizon with a time horizon of sixty days for the purpose of calculating the default risk of some or all of the equity positions, where appropriate. In such case, the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and default probabilities shall be consistent with a time horizon of sixty days and the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and bond prices shall be consistent with a one-year time horizon.
Article 325bo
Recognition of hedges in an internal default risk model
1.   Institutions may incorporate hedges in their internal default risk model and may net positions where the long positions and short positions relate to the same financial instrument.
2.   In their internal default risk models, institutions may only recognise hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers by explicitly modelling the gross long and short positions in the different instruments, including modelling of basis risks between different issuers.
3.   In their internal default risk models, institutions shall capture material risks between a hedging instrument and the hedged instrument that could occur during the interval between the maturity of a hedging instrument and the one-year time horizon, as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies that arise from differences in the type of product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external ratings, maturity, vintage and other differences. Institutions shall recognise a hedging instrument only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit event or other event.
Article 325bp
Particular requirements for an internal default risk model
1.   The internal default risk model referred to in Article 325bm(1) shall be capable of modelling the default of individual issuers as well as the simultaneous default of multiple issuers, and shall take into account the impact of those defaults in the market values of the positions that are included in the scope of that model. For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using two types of systematic risk factors.
2.   The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependency between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products.
4.   The internal default risk model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.
5.   To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of default probabilities shall meet the following requirements:
(a)
the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,03 %;
(b)
the default probabilities shall be based on a one-year time horizon, unless stated otherwise in this Section;
(c)
the default probabilities shall be measured using, solely or in combination with current market prices, data observed during a historical period of at least five years of actual past defaults and extreme declines in market prices equivalent to default events; default probabilities shall not be inferred solely from current market prices;
(d)
an institution that has been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate default probabilities;
(e)
an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate default probabilities; in both situations, the estimates of default probabilities shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article.
6.   To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of loss given default shall meet the following requirements:
(a)
the loss given default estimates are floored at 0 %;
(b)
the loss given default estimates shall reflect the seniority of each position;
(c)
an institution that has been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate loss given default estimates;
(d)
an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate loss given default; in both situations, the estimates of loss given default shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article.
7.   As part of the independent review and validation of the internal models that they use for the purposes of this Chapter, including for the risk-measurement system, institutions shall:
(a)
verify that their approach for the modelling of correlations and price changes is appropriate for their portfolio, including the choice and weights of the systematic risk factors in the model;
(b)
perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal default risk model, in particular with regard to the treatment of concentrations; and
(c)
apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.
The tests referred to in point (b) shall not be limited to the range of past events experienced.
8.   The internal default risk model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions.
9.   The internal default risk model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.
10.   Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining the default assumptions for correlations between different issuers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bn(1) and the preferred choice of method for estimating the default probabilities in point (e) of paragraph 5 of this Article and the loss given default in point (d) of paragraph 6 of this Article.
11.   Institutions shall document their internal models so that their correlation assumptions and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.
12.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the requirements that an institution's internal methodology or external sources are to fulfil for estimating default probabilities and losses given default in accordance with point (e) of paragraph 5 and point (d) of paragraph 6.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.’;

(93)
Article 390 is replaced by the following:
‘Article 390
Calculation of the exposure value
1.   The total exposures to a group of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures to individual clients in that group.
2.   The overall exposures to individual clients shall be calculated by adding the exposures in the trading book and the exposures in the non-trading book.
3.   For exposures in the trading book, institutions may:
(a)
offset their long positions and short positions in the same financial instruments issued by a given client, with the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated in accordance with the methods laid down in Chapter 2 of Title IV of Part Three;
(b)
offset their long positions and short positions in different financial instruments issued by a given client, but only where the financial instrument underlying the short position is junior to the financial instrument underlying the long position or where the underlying instruments are of the same seniority.

By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, institutions with permission to use the methods referred to in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three and Section 6 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three may use those methods for calculating the exposure value for securities financing transactions.
5.   Institutions shall add to the total exposure to a client the exposures arising from derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivative contracts, where the contract was not directly entered into with that client but the underlying debt or equity instrument was issued by that client.
6.   Exposures shall not include any of the following:
(a)
in the case of foreign exchange transactions, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the two business days following payment;
(b)
in the case of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the five business days following payment or delivery of the securities, whichever is the earlier;

8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
the conditions and methodologies to be used to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients for the types of exposures referred to in paragraph 7;
(b)
the conditions under which the structure of the transactions referred to in paragraph 7 do not constitute an additional exposure.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.

Calculating the effect of the use of credit risk mitigation techniques
1.   For calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1), an institution may use the fully adjusted exposure value (E*) as calculated under Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three, taking into account the credit risk mitigation, volatility adjustments and any maturity mismatch referred to in that Chapter.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions with permission to use the methods referred to in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three and Section 6 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three, may use those methods for calculating the exposure value of securities financing transactions.
3.   In calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1), institutions shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit-risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken.
The periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions' adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations.
The stress tests carried out shall be adequate and appropriate for the assessment of those risks.
Institutions shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk:
(a)
policies and procedures to address risks arising from maturity mismatches between exposures and any credit protection on those exposures;
(b)
policies and procedures relating to concentration risk arising from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, in particular from large indirect credit exposures, for example, exposures to a single issuer of securities taken as collateral.
4.   Where an institution reduces an exposure to a client using an eligible credit risk mitigation technique in accordance with Article 399(1), the institution, in the manner set out in Article 403, shall treat the part of the exposure by which the exposure to the client has been reduced as having been incurred for the protection provider rather than for the client.’;

Substitution approach

(a)
where the guarantee is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated, shall calculate the amount of the exposure that is deemed to be covered in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of currency mismatch for unfunded credit protection set out in Part Three;
(b)
shall treat any mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of maturity mismatch set out in Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three;
(c)

‘2.   An institution shall notify the competent authorities of all contracts entered into of which the contractual conditions lead to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs, within 30 days after a material deterioration of the institution's credit quality. Where the competent authorities consider those contracts to be material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts, which shall correspond to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in its credit quality, such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of that material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into, and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities.
3.   The institution shall add an additional outflow which shall correspond to the collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on its derivatives transactions if material.
EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions under which the notion of materiality may be applied and specifying methods for the measurement of the additional outflow.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.

THE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO

Article 428a
Application on a consolidated basis
Where the net stable funding ratio set out in this Title applies on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(4), the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
the assets and off-balance-sheet items of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to required stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are higher than those specified in Chapter 4 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the higher factors specified in the national law of that third country;
(b)
the liabilities and own funds of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to available stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are lower than those specified in Chapter 3 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the lower factors specified in the national law of that third country;
(c)
third-country assets which meet the requirements laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and which are held by a subsidiary having its head office in a third country shall not be recognised as liquid assets for consolidation purposes where they do not qualify as liquid assets under the national law of that third country which sets out the liquidity coverage requirement;
(d)
investment firms that are not subject to this Title pursuant to Article 6(4) within the group shall be subject to Articles 413 and 428b on a consolidated basis; except as specified in this point, such investment firms shall remain subject to the detailed net stable funding requirement for investment firms as laid down in national law.
Article 428b
The net stable funding ratio
1.   The net stable funding requirement laid down in Article 413(1) shall be equal to the ratio of the institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 to the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4, and shall be expressed as a percentage. Institutions shall calculate their net stable funding ratio in accordance with the following formula:





2.   Institutions shall maintain a net stable funding ratio of at least 100 %, calculated in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination.
3.   Where, at any time, the net stable funding ratio of an institution has fallen below 100 %, or can be reasonably expected to fall below 100 %, the requirement laid down in Article 414 shall apply. The institution shall aim to restore its net stable funding ratio to the level referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. Competent authorities shall assess the reasons for the institution's failure to comply with paragraph 2 of this Article before taking any supervisory measures.
4.   Institutions shall calculate and monitor their net stable funding ratio in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination, and separately for their transactions denominated in each of the currencies that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).
5.   Institutions shall ensure that the distribution of their funding profile by currency denomination is generally consistent with the distribution of their assets by currency. Where appropriate, competent authorities may require institutions to restrict currency mismatches by setting limits on the proportion of required stable funding in a particular currency that can be met by available stable funding that is not denominated in that currency. That restriction may only be applied for a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).
In determining the level of any restriction on currency mismatches that may be applied in accordance with this Article, competent authorities shall at least consider:
(a)
whether the institution has the ability to transfer available stable funding from one currency to another and across jurisdictions and legal entities within its group and the ability to swap currencies and raise funds in foreign currency markets over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;
(b)
the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on existing mismatched positions and on the effectiveness of any foreign currency exchange hedges that are in place.
Any restriction on currency mismatches imposed in accordance with this Article shall constitute a specific liquidity requirement as referred to in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
Article 428c
Calculation of the net stable funding ratio
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Title, institutions shall take into account assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items on a gross basis.
2.   For the purpose of calculating their net stable funding ratio, institutions shall apply the appropriate stable funding factors set out in Chapters 3 and 4 to the accounting value of their assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, unless otherwise specified in this Title.
3.   Institutions shall not double count required stable funding and available stable funding.
Unless otherwise specified in this Title, where an item can be allocated to more than one required stable funding category, it shall be allocated to the required stable funding category that produces the greatest contractual required stable funding for that item.
Article 428d
Derivative contracts
1.   Institutions shall apply this Article to calculate the amount of required stable funding for derivative contracts as referred to in Chapters 3 and 4.
2.   Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a net basis where those positions are included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1). Where that is not the case, institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a gross basis and shall treat those derivative positions as belonging to their own netting set for the purposes of Chapter 4.
3.   For the purposes of this Title, the ‘fair value of a netting set’ means the sum of the fair values of all the transactions included in a netting set.
4.   Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), all derivative contracts listed in points 2(a) to (e) of Annex II that involve a full exchange of principal amounts on the same date shall be calculated on a net basis across currencies, including for the purpose of reporting in a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2), even where those transactions are not included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1).
5.   Cash received as collateral to mitigate the exposure of a derivative position shall be treated as such and shall not be treated as deposits to which Chapter 3 applies.
6.   Competent authorities may decide, with the approval of the relevant central bank, to waive the impact of derivative contracts on the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, including through the determination of the required stable funding factors and of provisions and losses, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
those contracts have a residual maturity of less than six months;
(b)
the counterparty is the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;
(c)
the derivative contracts serve the monetary policy of the ECB or the central bank of a Member State.
Where a subsidiary having its head office in a third country benefits from the waiver referred to in the first subparagraph under the national law of that third country which sets out the net stable funding requirement, that waiver as specified in the national law of the third country shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.
Article 428e
Netting of secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions
Assets and liabilities resulting from securities financing transactions with a single counterparty shall be calculated on a net basis, provided that those assets and liabilities comply with the netting conditions set out in Article 429b(4).
Article 428f
Interdependent assets and liabilities
1.   Subject to prior approval of the competent authorities, an institution may treat an asset and a liability as interdependent, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the institution acts solely as a pass-through unit to channel the funding from the liability into the corresponding interdependent asset;
(b)
the individual interdependent assets and liabilities are clearly identifiable and have the same principal amount;
(c)
the asset and interdependent liability have substantially matched maturities, with a maximum delay of 20 days between the maturity of the asset and the maturity of the liability;
(d)
the interdependent liability has been requested pursuant to a legal, regulatory or contractual commitment and is not used to fund other assets;
(e)
the principal payment flows from the asset are not used for other purposes than repaying the interdependent liability;
(f)
the counterparties for each pair of interdependent assets and liabilities are not the same.
2.   Assets and liabilities shall be considered to meet the conditions set out in paragraph 1 and be considered as interdependent where they are directly linked to the following products or services:
(a)
centralised regulated savings, provided that institutions are legally required to transfer regulated deposits to a centralised fund which is set up and controlled by the central government of a Member State and which provides loans to promote public interest objectives, and provided that the transfer of deposits to the centralised fund occurs on at least a monthly basis;
(b)
promotional loans and credit and liquidity facilities that fulfil the criteria set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) for institutions acting as simple intermediaries that do not incur any funding risk;
(c)
covered bonds that meet all the following conditions:
(i)
they are bonds referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC or they meet the eligibility requirements for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) of this Regulation;
(ii)
the underlying loans are fully match funded with the covered bonds that were issued or the covered bonds have non-discretionary extendable maturity triggers of one year or more until the term of the underlying loans in the event of refinancing failure at the maturity date of the covered bond;
(d)
derivative client clearing activities, provided that the institution does not provide to its clients guarantees of the performance of the CCP and, as a result, does not incur any funding risk.
3.   EBA shall monitor assets and liabilities, as well as products and services that are treated as interdependent assets and liabilities under paragraphs 1 and 2, to determine whether and to what extent the suitability criteria laid down in paragraph 1 are met. EBA shall report to the Commission on the results of that monitoring and shall advise the Commission on whether an amendment to the conditions set out in paragraph 1 or an amendment to the list of products and services in paragraph 2 would be necessary.
Article 428g
Deposits in institutional protection schemes and cooperative networks
Where an institution belongs to an institutional protection scheme of the type referred to in Article 113(7), to a network that is eligible for the waiver provided for in Article 10, or to a cooperative network in a Member State, the sight deposits that the institution maintains with the central institution and that the depositing institution considers to be liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to the following:
(a)
the depositing institution shall apply the required stable funding factor under Section 2 of Chapter 4, depending on the treatment of those sight deposits as level 1, level 2A or level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and depending on the relevant haircut applied to those sight deposits for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio;
(b)
the central institution receiving the deposit shall apply the corresponding symmetric available stable funding factor.
Article 428h
Preferential treatment within a group or within an institutional protection scheme
1.   By way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, where Article 428g does not apply, competent authorities may authorise institutions on a case-by-case basis to apply a higher available stable funding factor or a lower required stable funding factor to assets, liabilities and committed credit or liquidity facilities, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the counterparty is one of the following:
(i)
the parent or a subsidiary of the institution;
(ii)
another subsidiary of the same parent;
(iii)
an undertaking that is related to the institution within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;
(iv)
a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation as the institution;
(v)
the central body or an affiliated credit institution of a network or a cooperative group as referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;
(b)
there are reasons to expect that the liability or committed credit or liquidity facility received by the institution constitutes a more stable source of funding, or that the asset or committed credit or liquidity facility granted by the institution requires less stable funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio than the same liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility received or granted by other counterparties;
(c)
the counterparty applies a required stable funding factor that is equal to or higher than the higher available stable funding factor or applies an available stable funding factor that is equal to or lower than the lower required stable funding factor;
(d)
the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.
2.   Where the institution and the counterparty are established in different Member States, competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 1, provided that, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, the following criteria are met:
(a)
there are legally binding agreements and commitments between group entities regarding the liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility;
(b)
the funding provider presents a low funding risk profile;
(c)
the funding risk profile of the recipient of the funding has been adequately taken into account in the liquidity risk management of the funding provider.
The competent authorities shall consult each other in accordance with point (b) of Article 20(1) to determine whether the additional criteria set out in this paragraph are met.
Article 428i
Calculation of the amount of available stable funding
Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds.
Bonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.
Article 428j
Residual maturity of a liability or of own funds
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.
3.   Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits.
4.   In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, institutions shall treat any portion of liabilities having a residual maturity of one year or more that matures in less than six months and any portion of such liabilities that matures between six months and less than one year as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.
Article 428k
0 % available stable funding factor
1.   Unless otherwise specified in Articles 428l to 428o, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor, with the exception of the following:
(a)
deferred tax liabilities, which shall be treated in accordance with the nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised;
(b)
minority interests, which shall be treated in accordance with the term of the instrument.
2.   Deferred tax liabilities and minority interests as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to one of the following factors:
(a)
0 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is less than six months;
(b)
50 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is a minimum of six months but less than one year;
(c)
100 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is one year or more.
3.   The following liabilities shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor:
(a)
trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, of foreign currencies and of commodities, that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transactions, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;
(b)
liabilities that are categorised as being interdependent with assets in accordance with Article 428f;
(c)
liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by:
(i)
the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;
(ii)
the central bank of a third country;
(iii)
financial customers;
(d)
any other liabilities and capital items or instruments not referred to in Articles 428l to 428o.
4.   Institutions shall apply a 0 % available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.
The following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:
(a)
variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
(b)
all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.
Article 428l
50 % available stable funding factor
The following liabilities shall be subject to a 50 % available stable funding factor:
(a)
deposits received that fulfil the criteria for operational deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);
(b)
liabilities with a residual maturity of less than one year provided by:
(i)
the central government of a Member State or of a third country;
(ii)
regional governments or local authorities of a Member State or of a third country;
(iii)
public sector entities in a Member State or in a third country;

(d)
any other liabilities with a residual maturity of a minimum of six months but less than one year not referred to in Articles 428m, 428n and 428o.
Article 428m
90 % available stable funding factor
Sight retail deposits, retail deposits with a fixed notice period of less than one year and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the relevant criteria for other retail deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 90 % available stable funding factor.
Article 428n
95 % available stable funding factor
Sight retail deposits, retail deposits with a fixed notice period of less than one year and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the relevant criteria for stable retail deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 95 % available stable funding factor.

(b)
the Additional Tier 1 items of the institution before the deduction of the items referred to in Article 56 and before Article 79 has been applied thereto, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;
(c)
the Tier 2 items of the institution before the deductions referred to in Article 66 and before the application of Article 79, having a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;
(d)
any other capital instruments of the institution with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;
(e)
any other secured and unsecured borrowings and liabilities with a residual maturity of one year or more, including term deposits, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428k to 428n.
Article 428p
Calculation of the amount of required stable funding
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.
2.   Assets which institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding where those assets are accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution and the institution does not have beneficial ownership of the asset.
Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 where those assets are not accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution but the institution does have beneficial ownership of the assets.
3.   Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions over which the institution retains beneficial ownership, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, even where the assets do not remain on the balance sheet of the institution. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.
4.   Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.
Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.
5.   Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that asset is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction in relation to which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered, provided that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.
6.   The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:
(a)
assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded, credit lines that are available to the institution; those assets shall include assets placed by a credit institution with a central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme; institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer;
(b)
assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;
(c)
assets attached as non-mandatory overcollateralisation to a covered bond issuance.
7.   In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:
(a)
by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 428ad and from point (a) of Article 428ah(1), assets encumbered for the purposes of the operations referred to in this subparagraph;
(b)
by way of derogation from points (d)(i) and (d)(ii) of Article 428ad, from point (b) of Article 428af and from point (c) of Article 428ag, monies that result from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.
Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets as referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.
When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and shall take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.
8.   In order to avoid any double counting, institutions shall exclude assets that are associated with collateral that is recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and 428ah(2), recognised as initial margin posted, or recognised as a contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter.
9.   Institutions shall include foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments. They shall exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.
10.   Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.
Competent authorities shall report the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors to EBA at least once a year. They shall include an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors in that report.
Article 428q
Residual maturity of an asset
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.
3.   When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.
4.   In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.
Article 428r
0 % required stable funding factor
1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:
(a)
unencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 high quality liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements as set out in that delegated act;
(b)
unencumbered shares or units in CIUs that are eligible for a 0 % haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer set out in that delegated act;
(c)
all reserves held by the institution in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;
(d)
all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country that have a residual maturity of less than six months;
(e)
trade date receivables arising from sales of financial instruments, foreign currencies or commodities that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;
(f)

(b)
all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.
Article 428ai
Derogation for small and non-complex institutions
By way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, small and non-complex institutions may choose, with the prior permission of their competent authority, to calculate the ratio between an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 6, and the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 7, expressed as a percentage.
A competent authority may require a small and non-complex institution to comply with the net stable funding requirement based on an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 and the required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4 where it considers that the simplified methodology is not adequate to capture the funding risks of that institution.
Article 428aj
Simplified calculation of the amount of available stable funding
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds.
2.   Bonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.
Article 428ak
Residual maturity of a liability or own funds
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity.
3.   Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits.
4.   In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, for liabilities with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year, shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.
Article 428al
0 % available stable funding factor
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Section, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor, with the exception of the following:
(a)
deferred tax liabilities, which shall be treated in accordance with the nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised;
(b)
minority interests, which shall be treated in accordance with the term of the instrument concerned.
2.   Deferred tax liabilities and minority interests as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to one of the following factors:
(a)
0 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is less than one year;
(b)
100 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is one year or more.
3.   The following liabilities shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor:
(a)
trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, of foreign currencies and of commodities, that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;
(b)
liabilities that are categorised as being interdependent with assets in accordance with Article 428f;
(c)
liabilities with a residual maturity of less than one year provided by:
(i)
the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;
(ii)
the central bank of a third country;
(iii)
financial customers;
(d)
any other liabilities and capital items or instruments not referred to in this Article and Articles 428am to 428ap.
4.   Institutions shall apply a 0 % available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.
The following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:
(a)
variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;
(b)
all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.
Article 428am
50 % available stable funding factor

(b)
the Additional Tier 1 items of the institution before the deduction of the items referred to in Article 56 and before Article 79 has been applied thereto, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;
(c)
the Tier 2 items of the institution before the deductions referred to in Article 66 and before the application of Article 79, having a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;
(d)
any other capital instruments of the institution with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;
(e)
any other secured and unsecured borrowings and liabilities with a residual maturity of one year or more, including term deposits, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428al to 428ao.
Article 428aq
Simplified calculation of the amount of required stable funding
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, for small and non-complex institutions the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items.
2.   Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are accounted for in their balance sheet and on which they do not have beneficial ownership shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.
Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are not accounted for in their balance sheet but on which they have beneficial ownership shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2.
3.   Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions, over which they retain beneficial ownership, even where they do not remain on their balance sheet, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.
4.   Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.
Assets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered.
5.   Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction through which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered to the extent that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed.
6.   The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:
(a)
assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution, including assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme;
(b)
assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;
(c)
assets attached as non-mandatory over-collateralisation to a covered bond issuance.
For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer.
7.   In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:
(a)
by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (a) of Article 428az(1), assets encumbered for the operations referred to in this subparagraph;
(b)
by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (b) of Article 428ay, monies resulting from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.
Competent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.
When applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary.
8.   Institutions shall exclude assets associated with collateral recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and Article 428ah(2) or as initial margin posted or as contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter in order to avoid any double counting.
9.   Institutions shall include in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed. They shall exclude from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled.
10.   Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.
Competent authorities shall report to EBA the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors at least once a year. They shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors.
Article 428ar
Residual maturity of an asset
1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2.
2.   Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates.
3.   When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date.
4.   In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, the portions that mature in less than six months and between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively.
Article 428as
0 % required stable funding factor
1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:
(a)
unencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 high quality liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements as set out in that delegated act;
(b)
all reserves held by the institution in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;
(c)
all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country that have a residual maturity of less than six months;
(d)
assets that are categorised as being interdependent with liabilities in accordance with Article 428f.
2.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.
For subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.
Article 428at
5 % required stable funding factor
1.   The undrawn portion of committed credit and liquidity facilities specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 5 % required stable funding factor.
2.   For all netting sets of derivative contracts, institutions shall apply a 5 % required stable funding factor to the absolute fair value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative fair value. For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the fair value as gross of any collateral posted or settlement payments and receipts related to market valuation changes of such contracts.
Article 428au
10 % required stable funding factor
The following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 10 % required stable funding factor:
(a)

5.   By way of derogation from point (d) of paragraph 4, the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
a derivative instrument that is considered an off-balance-sheet item in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 4 but is treated as a derivative in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, shall be subject to the treatment set out in that point;
(b)
where a client of an institution acting as a clearing member enters directly into a derivative transaction with a CCP and the institution guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures to the CCP arising from that transaction, the institution shall calculate its exposure resulting from the guarantee in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 4, as if that institution had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to the receipt or provision of cash variation margin.
The treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall also apply to an institution acting as a higher-level client that guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph and of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions may consider an affiliated entity as a client only where that entity is outside the regulatory scope of consolidation at the level at which the requirement set out in point (d) of Article 92(3) is applied.

8.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 7, institutions may reduce the exposure value of a pre-financing loan or an intermediate loan by the positive balance on the savings account of the debtor to which the loan was granted and only include the resulting amount in the total exposure measure, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the granting of the loan is conditional upon the opening of the savings account at the institution granting the loan and both the loan and the savings account are regulated by the same sectoral law;

For the purposes of points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph, and without prejudice to the Union State aid rules and the obligations of the Member States thereunder, competent authorities may, upon request of an institution, treat an organisationally, structurally and financially independent and autonomous unit of that institution as a public development credit institution, provided that the unit fulfils all the conditions listed in the first subparagraph and that such treatment does not affect the effectiveness of the supervision of that institution. Competent authorities shall without delay notify the Commission and EBA of any decision to treat, for the purposes of this subparagraph, a unit of an institution as a public development credit institution. The competent authority shall annually review such decision.
3.   For the purposes of points (d) and (e) of paragraph 1 and point (d) of paragraph 2, ‘promotional loan’ means a loan granted by a public development credit institution or an entity set up by the central government, regional government or local authority of a Member State, directly or through an intermediate credit institution on a non-competitive, not-for-profit basis, in order to promote the public policy objectives of the central government, regional government or local authority in a Member State.

Article 429b
Calculation of the exposure value of assets
1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e in accordance with the following principles:
(a)
the exposure values of assets means an exposure value as referred to in the first sentence of Article 111(1);
(b)
securities financing transactions shall not be netted.
2.   A cash pooling arrangement offered by an institution does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7) only where the arrangement meets both of the following conditions:
(a)
the institution offering the cash pooling arrangement transfers the credit and debit balances of several individual accounts of entities of a group included in the arrangement (‘original accounts’) into a separate, single account and thereby sets the balances of the original accounts to zero;
(b)
the institution carries out the actions referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph on a daily basis.
For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 3, cash pooling arrangement means an arrangement whereby the credit or debit balances of several individual accounts are combined for the purposes of cash or liquidity management.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, a cash pooling arrangement that does not meet the condition set out in point (b) of that paragraph, but meets the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph, does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7), provided that the arrangement meets all the following conditions:
(a)
the institution has a legally enforceable right to set off the balances of the original accounts through the transfer into a single account at any point in time;
(b)
there are no maturity mismatches between the balances of the original accounts;
(c)
the institution charges or pays interest based on the combined balance of the original accounts;
(d)
the competent authority of the institution considers that the frequency by which the balances of all original accounts are transferred is adequate for the purpose of including only the combined balance of the cash pooling arrangement in the total exposure measure.
4.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate the exposure value of cash receivable and cash payable under securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis only where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;
(b)
the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency and bankruptcy;
(c)
the counterparties intend to settle on a net basis or to settle simultaneously, or the transactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net settlement.
5.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 4, institutions may consider that a settlement mechanism results in the functional equivalent of net settlement only where, on the settlement date, the net result of the cash flows of the transactions under that mechanism is equal to the single net amount under net settlement and all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the transactions are settled through the same settlement system or settlement systems using a common settlement infrastructure;
(b)
the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that the settlement of the transactions will occur by the end of the business day;
(c)
any issues arising from the securities legs of the securities financing transactions do not interfere with the completion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and payables.
The condition set out in point (c) of the first subparagraph is met only where the failure of any securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism may delay settlement of only the matching cash leg or may create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility.
Where there is a failure of the securities leg of a securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement mechanism, institutions shall split out this transaction and its matching cash leg from the netting set and treat them on a gross basis.
Article 429c
Calculation of the exposure value of derivatives
1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, including those that are off-balance-sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three.
When calculating the exposure value, institutions may take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements in accordance with Article 295. Institutions shall not take into account cross-product netting, but may net within the product category as referred to in point (25)(c) of Article 272 and credit derivatives where they are subject to a contractual cross-product netting agreement as referred to in point (c) of Article 295.
Institutions shall include in the total exposure measure sold options even where their exposure value can be set to zero in accordance with the treatment laid down in Article 274(5).
2.   Where the provision of collateral related to derivative contracts reduces the amount of assets under the applicable accounting framework, institutions shall reverse that reduction.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions calculating the replacement cost of derivative contracts in accordance with Article 275 may recognise only collateral received in cash from their counterparties as the variation margin referred to in Article 275, where the applicable accounting framework has not already recognised the variation margin as a reduction of the exposure value and where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
for trades not cleared through a QCCP, the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated;
(b)
the variation margin is calculated and exchanged at least daily based on a mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions;
(c)
the variation margin received is in a currency specified in the derivative contract, governing master netting agreement, credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement or as defined by any netting agreement with a QCCP;
(d)
the variation margin received is the full amount that would be necessary to extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative contract subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts that are applicable to the counterparty;
(e)
the derivative contract and the variation margin between the institution and the counterparty to that contract are covered by a single netting agreement that the institution may treat as risk-reducing in accordance with Article 295.
Where an institution provides cash collateral to a counterparty and that collateral meets the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) of the first subparagraph, the institution shall consider that collateral as the variation margin posted with the counterparty and shall include it in the calculation of the replacement cost.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, an institution shall be considered to have met the condition set out therein where the variation margin is exchanged on the morning of the trading day following the trading day on which the derivative contract was stipulated, provided that the exchange is based on the value of the contract at the end of the trading day on which the contract was stipulated.
For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, where a margin dispute arises, institutions may recognise the amount of non-disputed collateral that has been exchanged.
4.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall not include collateral received in the calculation of NICA as defined in point (12a) of Article 272, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.
5.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall set the value of the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 278(1) to one, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP.
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Section 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three to determine the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in points 1 and 2 of Annex II, but only where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92.
Where institutions apply one of the methods referred to in the first subparagraph, they shall not reduce the total exposure measure by the amount of margin they have received.
Article 429d
Additional provisions on the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives
1.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘written credit derivative’ means any financial instrument through which an institution effectively provides credit protection including credit default swaps, total return swaps and options where the institution has the obligation to provide credit protection under conditions specified in the options contract.
2.   In addition to the calculation laid down in Article 429c, institutions shall include in the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives the effective notional amounts referenced in the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to those written credit derivatives.
Institutions shall calculate the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives by adjusting the notional amount of those derivatives to reflect the true exposure of the contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction.
3.   Institutions may fully or partly reduce the exposure value calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;
(b)
the purchased credit derivative is otherwise subject to the same or more conservative material terms as those in the corresponding written credit derivative;
(c)
the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty that would expose the institution to Specific Wrong-Way risk, as defined in point (b) of Article 291(1);
(d)
where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is reduced by any negative change in fair value incorporated in the institution's Tier 1 capital, the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital;
(e)
the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction that has been cleared by the institution on behalf of a client or that has been cleared by the institution in its role as a higher-level client in a multi-level client structure and for which the effective notional amount referenced by the corresponding written credit derivative is excluded from the total exposure measure in accordance with point (g) or (h) of the first subparagraph of Article 429a(1), as applicable.
For the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 429c(1), institutions may exclude from the netting set the portion of a written credit derivative which is not offset in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for which the effective notional amount is included in the total exposure measure.
4.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 3, ‘material term’ means any characteristic of the credit derivative that is relevant to the valuation thereof, including the level of subordination, the optionality, the credit events, the underlying reference entity or pool of entities, and the underlying reference obligation or pool of obligations, with the exception of the notional amount and the residual maturity of the credit derivative. Two reference names shall be the same only where they refer to the same legal entity.
5.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 3, institutions may use purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference names to offset written credit derivatives on individual reference names within that pool where the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are the same.
6.   Institutions shall not reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative in Tier 1 capital.
7.   In the case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference obligations, institutions may reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives on individual reference obligations by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives in accordance with paragraph 3 only where the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual obligations in the pool.
Article 429e
Counterparty credit risk add-on for securities financing transactions
1.   In addition to the calculation of the exposure value of securities financing transactions, including those that are off-balance-sheet in accordance with Article 429b(1), institutions shall include in the total exposure measure an add-on for counterparty credit risk calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article, as applicable.
2.   Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are not subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on a transaction-by-transaction basis in accordance with the following formula:





where:





=
the add-on;
i
=
the index that denotes the transaction;
Ei

=
the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty under transaction i; and
Ci

=
the fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty under transaction i.





3.   Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on an agreement-by-agreement basis in accordance with the following formula:





where:





=
the add-on;
i
=
the index that denotes the netting agreement;
Ei

=
the fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty for the transactions that are subject to master netting agreement i; and
Ci

=
the fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty that is subject to master netting agreement i.
4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the term counterparty includes also tri-party agents that receive collateral in deposit and manage the collateral in the case of tri-party transactions.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Article 222, subject to a 20 % floor for the applicable risk weight, to determine the add-on for securities financing transactions including those that are off-balance-sheet. Institutions may use that method only where they also use it for calculating the exposure value of those transactions for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements as set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 92(1).
6.   Where sale accounting is achieved for a repurchase transaction under the applicable accounting framework, the institution shall reverse all sales-related accounting entries.
7.   Where an institution acts as an agent between two parties in a securities financing transaction, including an off-balance-sheet transaction, the following provisions shall apply to the calculation of the institution's total exposure measure:
(a)
where the institution provides an indemnity or guarantee to one of the parties in the securities financing transaction and the indemnity or guarantee is limited to any difference between the value of the security or cash the party has lent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, the institution shall only include the add-on calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, in the total exposure measure;
(b)
where the institution does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the transaction shall not be included in the total exposure measure;
(c)
where the institution is economically exposed to the underlying security or the cash in the transaction to an amount greater than the exposure covered by the add-on, it shall include in the total exposure measure also the full amount of the security or the cash to which it is exposed;
(d)
where the institution acting as agent provides an indemnity or guarantee to both parties involved in a securities financing transaction, the institution shall calculate its total exposure measure in accordance with points (a), (b) and (c) separately for each party involved in the transaction.
Article 429f
Calculation of the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items
1.   Institutions shall calculate, in accordance with Article 111(1), the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, securities financing transactions and positions referred to in Article 429d.
Where a commitment refers to the extension of another commitment, Article 166(9) shall apply.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions may reduce the credit exposure equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet item by the corresponding amount of specific credit risk adjustments. The calculation shall be subject to a floor of zero.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall apply a conversion factor of 10 % to low-risk off-balance-sheet items referred to in point (d) of Article 111(1).
Article 429g
Calculation of the exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement
1.   Institutions shall treat cash related to regular-way sales and securities related to regular-way purchases which remain on the balance sheet until the settlement date as assets in accordance with point (a) of Article 429(4).
2.   Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply trade date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall reverse out any offsetting between cash receivables for regular-way sales awaiting settlement and cash payables for regular-way purchase awaiting settlement allowed under that framework. After institutions have reversed out the accounting offsetting, they may offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where both the related regular-way sales and purchases are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis.
3.   Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply settlement date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall include in the total exposure measure the full nominal value of commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases.
Institutions may offset the full nominal value of the commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases by the full nominal value of cash receivables related to regular-way sales awaiting settlement only where both of the following conditions are met:
(a)
both the regular-way purchases and sales are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis;
(b)
the financial assets bought and sold that are associated with cash payables and receivables are fair valued through profit and loss and included in the institution's trading book.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Article 430
Reporting on prudential requirements and financial information
1.   Institutions shall report to their competent authorities on:
(a)
own funds requirements, including the leverage ratio, as set out in Article 92 and Part Seven;
(b)
the requirements laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, for institutions that are subject to those requirements;
(c)
large exposures as set out in Article 394;
(d)
liquidity requirements as set out in Article 415;
(e)
the aggregate data for each national immovable property market as set out in Article 430a(1);
(f)
the requirements and guidance set out in Directive 2013/36/EU qualified for standardised reporting, except for any additional reporting requirement under point (j) of Article 104(1) of that Directive;
(g)
the level of asset encumbrance, including a breakdown by the type of asset encumbrance, such as repurchase agreements, securities lending, securitised exposures or loans.
Institutions exempted in accordance with Article 6(5) shall not be subject to the reporting requirement on the leverage ratio set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph on an individual basis.
2.   In addition to the reporting on the leverage ratio referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in order to enable the competent authorities to monitor leverage ratio volatility, in particular around reporting reference dates, large institutions shall report specific components of the leverage ratio to their competent authorities based on averages over the reporting period and the data used to calculate those averages.
3.   In addition to the reporting on prudential requirements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report financial information to their competent authorities where they are one of the following:
(a)
an institution that is subject to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002;
(b)
a credit institution that prepares its consolidated accounts in accordance with the international accounting standards pursuant to point (b) of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.
4.   Competent authorities may require credit institutions that determine their own funds on a consolidated basis in accordance with international accounting standards pursuant to Article 24(2) to report financial information in accordance with this Article.
5.   The reporting on financial information referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall only comprise information that is needed to provide a comprehensive view of the institution's risk profile and the systemic risks posed by the institution to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
6.   The reporting requirements laid down in this Article shall be applied to institutions in a proportionate manner taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 8, having regard to their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities.
7.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the uniform reporting formats and templates, the instructions and methodology on how to use those templates, the frequency and dates of reporting, the definitions and the IT solutions for the reporting referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4.
Any new reporting requirements set out in such implementing technical standards shall not be applicable earlier than six months from the date of their entry into force.
For the purposes of paragraph 2, the draft implementing technical standards shall specify which components of the leverage ratio shall be reported using day-end or month-end values. For that purpose, EBA shall take into account both of the following:
(a)
how susceptible a component is to significant temporary reductions in transaction volumes that could result in an underrepresentation of the risk of excessive leverage at the reporting reference date;
(b)
developments and findings at international level.
EBA shall submit to the Commission the draft implementing technical standards referred to in this paragraph by 28 June 2021, except in relation to the following:
(a)
the leverage ratio, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020;
(b)
the obligations laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
8.   EBA shall assess the costs and benefits of the reporting requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (*14) in accordance with this paragraph and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020. That assessment shall be carried out in particular in relation to small and non-complex institutions. For those purposes, the report shall:
(a)
classify institutions into categories based on their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities;
(b)
measure the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions during the relevant period to meet the reporting requirements set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, taking into account the following principles:
(i)
the reporting costs shall be measured as the ratio of the reporting costs relative to the institution's total costs during the relevant period;
(ii)
the reporting costs shall comprise all expenditure related to the implementation and operation on an on-going basis of the reporting systems, including expenditure on staff, IT systems, legal, accounting, auditing and consultancy services;
(iii)
the relevant period shall refer to each annual period during which institutions have incurred reporting costs to prepare for the implementation of the reporting requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and to continue operating the reporting systems on an on-going basis;
(c)
assess whether the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered by the reporting requirements for the purposes of prudential supervision;
(d)
assess the effects of a reduction of reporting requirement on costs and supervisory effectiveness; and
(e)
make recommendations on how to reduce reporting requirements at least for small and non-complex institutions, to which end EBA shall target an expected average cost reduction of at least 10 % but ideally a 20 % cost reduction. EBA shall, in particular, assess whether:
(i)
the reporting requirements referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1 could be waived for small and non-complex institutions where asset encumbrance was below a certain threshold;
(ii)
the reporting frequency required in accordance with points (a), (c), and (g) of paragraph 1 could be reduced for small and non-complex institutions.
EBA shall accompany that report by draft implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7.
9.   Competent authorities shall consult EBA on whether institutions, other than those referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, should report on financial information on a consolidated basis in accordance with paragraph 3, provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the relevant institutions are not already reporting on a consolidated basis;
(b)
the relevant institutions are subject to an accounting framework in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC;
(c)
financial reporting is considered necessary to provide a comprehensive view of the risk profile of those institutions' activities and of the systemic risks they pose to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the formats and templates that institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall use for the purposes set out therein.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
10.   Where a competent authority considers information not covered by the implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7 as necessary for the purposes set out in paragraph 5, it shall notify EBA and the ESRB of the additional information it considers necessary to include in the implementing technical standards referred to in that paragraph.
11.   Competent authorities may waive the requirement to submit any of the data points set out in the reporting templates specified in the implementing technical standards referred to in this Article where those data points are duplicative. For those purposes, duplicative data points shall refer to any data points which are already available to the competent authorities by means other than by collecting those reporting templates, including where those data points can be obtained from data that is already available to the competent authorities in different formats or levels of granularity; the competent authority may only grant the waivers referred to in this paragraph if data received, collated or aggregated through such alternative methods are identical to those data points which would otherwise have to be reported in accordance with the respective implementing technical standards.
Competent authorities, resolution authorities and designated authorities shall make use of data exchange wherever possible to reduce reporting requirements. The provisions on the exchange of information and professional secrecy as laid down in Section II of Chapter I of Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU shall apply.
Article 430a

3.   In addition to the requirement set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, from the end of a three-year-period following the date of entry into force of the latest regulatory technical standards referred to in Articles 325bd(7), 325be(3), 325bf(9), 325bg(4), institutions shall report, for those positions assigned to trading desks for which they have been granted permission by the competent authorities to use the alternative internal model approach in accordance with Article 325az(2), the results of the calculations based on using that approach set out in Chapter 1b of Title IV of Part Three on the same basis as such institutions report the obligations laid down in points (b)(i) and (c) of Article 92(3).
4.   For the purposes of the reporting requirement in paragraph 3 of this Article, institutions shall report separately the calculations set out in points (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of Article 325ba(1) and for the portfolio of all trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange and commodity risks assigned to trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission by the competent authorities to use the alternative internal model approach in accordance with Article 325az(2).

1.   EBA shall prepare a report on feasibility regarding the development of a consistent and integrated system for collecting statistical data, resolution data and prudential data and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020.
2.   When drafting the feasibility report, EBA shall involve competent authorities, as well as authorities that are responsible for deposit guarantee schemes, resolution and in particular the ESCB. The report shall take into account the previous work of the ESCB regarding integrated data collections and shall be based on an overall cost and benefit analysis including as a minimum:
(a)
an overview of the quantity and scope of the current data collected by the competent authorities in their jurisdiction and of its origins and granularity;
(b)
the establishment of a standard dictionary of the data to be collected, in order to increase the convergence of reporting requirements as regards regular reporting obligations, and to avoid unnecessary queries;
(c)
the establishment of a joint committee, including as a minimum EBA and the ESCB, for the development and implementation of the integrated reporting system;
(d)
the feasibility and possible design of a central data collection point for the integrated reporting system, including requirements to ensure strict confidentiality of the data collected, strong authentication and management of access rights to the system and cybersecurity, which:
(i)
contains a central data register with all statistical data, resolution data and prudential data in the necessary granularity and frequency for the particular institution and is updated at necessary intervals;
(ii)
serves as a point of contact for the competent authorities, where they receive, process and pool all data queries, where queries can be matched with existing collected reported data and which allows the competent authorities quick access to the requested information;
(iii)
provides additional support to the competent authorities for the transmission of data queries to the institutions and enters the requested data into the central data register;
(iv)
holds a coordinating role for the exchange of information and data between competent authorities; and
(v)

Information shall be regarded as confidential where the institutions are obliged by customers or other counterparty relationships to keep that information confidential.
EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on how institutions have to apply proprietary and confidentiality in relation to the disclosure requirements of Titles II and III.
3.   In the exceptional cases referred to in paragraph 2, the institution concerned shall state in its disclosures the fact that specific items of information are not being disclosed and the reason for not disclosing those items, and publish more general information about the subject matter of the disclosure requirement, except where that subject matter is, in itself, proprietary or confidential.

The ESRB shall forward the notification to the European Parliament, to the Council and to EBA without delay.
The notification shall be accompanied by the following documents and include, where appropriate, relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence on:

Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.
In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.

The assessment of the Council shall take into account the opinion of the ESRB and EBA and shall be based on the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 2 by the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1.
In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month of receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State concerned may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.

(a)
methodologies for the assessment of the effective riskiness of exposures related to assets and activities associated substantially with environmental and/or social objectives compared to the riskiness of other exposure;
(b)
the development of appropriate criteria for the assessment of physical risks and transition risks, including the risks related to the depreciation of assets due to regulatory changes;

That report shall assess, in particular, for each exemption provided for in those Articles:
(a)
the number of large exposures exempted in each Member State;
(b)
the number of institutions that make use of the exemption in each Member State;

That report shall at least assess:
(a)
the opportunity to distinguish between margined and unmargined derivative contracts;
(b)
the opportunity to remove, increase or replace the requirement set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2);

(d)
the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for institutions' derivative contracts.
5.   If international standards affect the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 4, those changes of international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.
6.   EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including to the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers and report to the Commission on the appropriateness of that treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:
(a)
the opportunity to apply higher or lower stable funding factors to securities financing transactions with financial customers and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers to take better account of their funding risk over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio and of the possible contagion effects between financial customers;
(b)
the opportunity to apply the treatment set out in point (g) of Article 428r(1) to securities financing transactions collateralised by other types of assets;
(c)

(d)
the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with point (c) of Article 428k(3) and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and point (b) of Article 428v;

(a)
the possible impact of the treatment on investors' ability to gain exposure to assets and the impact of the treatment on credit supply in the capital markets union;
(b)
the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are funded by initial margin, either wholly or in part;
(c)
the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin.
10.   By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions.
11.   EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less. EBA shall submit its report to the Commission by 28 June 2021.’;
