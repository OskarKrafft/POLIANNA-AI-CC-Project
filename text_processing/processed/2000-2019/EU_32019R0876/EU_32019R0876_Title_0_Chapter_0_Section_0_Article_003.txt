Methods of prudential consolidation
1.   Institutions, financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies that are required to comply with the requirements referred to in Section 1 of this Chapter on the basis of their consolidated situation shall carry out a full consolidation of all institutions and financial institutions that are their subsidiaries. Paragraphs 3 to 6 and paragraph 9 of this Article shall not apply where Part Six and point (d) of Article 430(1) apply on the basis of the consolidated situation of an institution, financial holding company or mixed financial holding company or on the sub-consolidated situation of a liquidity sub-group as set out in Articles 8 and 10.
For the purposes of Article 11(3a), institutions that are required to comply with the requirements referred to in Article 92a or 92b on a consolidated basis shall carry out a full consolidation of all institutions and financial institutions that are their subsidiaries in the relevant resolution groups.
2.   Ancillary services undertakings shall be included in consolidation in the cases, and in accordance with the methods, laid down in this Article.
3.   Where undertakings are related within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU, competent authorities shall determine how consolidation is to be carried out.
4.   The consolidating supervisor shall require the proportional consolidation according to the share of capital held of participations in institutions and financial institutions managed by an undertaking included in the consolidation together with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidation, where the liability of those undertakings is limited to the share of the capital they hold.
5.   In the case of participations or capital ties other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4, competent authorities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out. In particular, they may permit or require the use of the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis.
6.   Competent authorities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out in the following cases:
(a)
where, in the opinion of the competent authorities, an institution exercises a significant influence over one or more institutions or financial institutions, but without holding a participation or other capital ties in those institutions; and
(b)
where two or more institutions or financial institutions are placed under single management other than pursuant to a contract, clauses of their memoranda or articles of association.
In particular, competent authorities may permit or require the use of the method provided for in Article 22(7), (8) and (9) of Directive 2013/34/EU. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in consolidated supervision.
7.   Where an institution has a subsidiary which is an undertaking other than an institution, a financial institution or an ancillary services undertaking or holds a participation in such an undertaking, it shall apply to that subsidiary or participation the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, competent authorities may allow or require institutions to apply a different method to such subsidiaries or participations, including the method required by the applicable accounting framework, provided that:
(a)
the institution does not already apply the equity method on 28 December 2020;
(b)
it would be unduly burdensome to apply the equity method or the equity method does not adequately reflect the risks that the undertaking referred to in the first subparagraph poses to the institution; and
(c)
the method applied does not result in full or proportional consolidation of that undertaking.
8.   Competent authorities may require full or proportional consolidation of a subsidiary or an undertaking in which an institution holds a participation where that subsidiary or undertaking is not an institution, financial institution or ancillary services undertaking and where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the undertaking is not an insurance undertaking, a third-country insurance undertaking, a reinsurance undertaking, a third-country reinsurance undertaking, an insurance holding company or an undertaking excluded from the scope of Directive 2009/138/EC in accordance with Article 4 of that Directive;
(b)
there is a substantial risk that the institution decides to provide financial support to that undertaking in stressed conditions, in the absence of, or in excess of any contractual obligations to provide such support.
9.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify conditions in accordance with which consolidation shall be carried out in the cases referred to in paragraphs 3 to 6 and paragraph 8.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.’;

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, subsidiary institutions may choose not to apply the requirements laid down in Articles 89, 90 and 91 and Parts Three, Four and Seven and the associated reporting requirements laid down in Part Seven A on the basis of their sub-consolidated situation where the total assets and off-balance-sheet items of their subsidiaries and participations in third countries are less than 10 % of the total amount of the assets and off-balance-sheet items of the subsidiary institution.’;

the provisions governing those subsequent issuances are substantially the same as the provisions governing those issuances for which the institutions have already received permission;
(b)
institutions have notified those subsequent issuances to the competent authorities sufficiently in advance of their classification as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments.

This subparagraph does not apply to the capital instruments referred to in Article 31.
On the basis of information collected from competent authorities, EBA shall establish, maintain and publish a list of all forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, EBA may collect any information in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that it considers necessary to establish compliance with the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29 of this Regulation and for the purpose of maintaining and updating the list referred to in this subparagraph.
Following the review process set out in Article 80 and where there is sufficient evidence that the relevant capital instruments do not meet or have ceased to meet the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29, EBA may decide not to add those instruments to the list referred to in the fourth subparagraph or remove them from that list, as the case may be.

the inclusion of those liabilities in eligible liabilities items would not give rise to a material risk of a successful legal challenge or of valid compensation claims as assessed by the resolution authority in relation to the principles referred to in point (g) of Article 34(1) and Article 75 of Directive 2014/59/EU.
4.   The resolution authority may permit liabilities to qualify as eligible liabilities instruments in addition to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 2, provided that:
(a)

4.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, where an eligible liabilities instrument includes early redemption options that are exercisable at the sole discretion of the issuer prior to the original stated maturity of the instrument, but where the provisions governing the instrument do not include any incentive for the instrument to be called, redeemed, repaid or repurchased prior to its maturity and do not include any option for redemption or repayment at the discretion of the holders, the maturity of the instrument shall be defined as the original stated maturity.
Article 72d

2.   Institutions shall exclude underwriting positions held for five business days or fewer from the amounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 and from the calculation of the factor in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 1.
3.   The amount to be deducted pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be apportioned across each eligible liabilities instrument of a G-SII entity held by the institution.

(a)
the amount of holdings required to be deducted pursuant to paragraph 1;
(b)
the proportion of the aggregate amount of direct, indirect and synthetic holdings by the institution of the eligible liabilities instruments of G-SII entities in which the institution does not have a significant investment represented by each eligible liabilities instrument held by the institution.

Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is the competent authority, it shall ensure that the relevant national bodies and authorities which have a macroprudential mandate are duly informed of the competent authority's intention to make use of this Article, and are appropriately involved in the assessment of financial stability concerns in its Member State in accordance with paragraph 2.
Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is different from the competent authority, the Member State shall adopt the necessary provisions to ensure proper coordination and exchange of information between the competent authority and the designated authority for the proper application of this Article. In particular, authorities shall be required to cooperate closely and to share all the information that may be necessary for the adequate performance of the duties imposed upon the designated authority pursuant to this Article. That cooperation shall aim at avoiding any form of duplicative or inconsistent action between the competent authority and the designated authority, as well as ensuring that the interaction with other measures, in particular measures taken under Article 458 of this Regulation and Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU, is duly taken into account.
2.   Based on the data collected under Article 430a and on any other relevant indicators, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article shall periodically, and at least annually, assess whether the risk weight of 35 % for exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on residential property referred to in Article 125 located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority and the risk weight of 50 % for exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property referred to in Article 126 located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority are appropriately based on:
(a)
the loss experience of exposures secured by immovable property;
(b)
forward-looking immovable property markets developments.
Where, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article concludes that the risk weights set out in Article 125(2) or 126(2) do not adequately reflect the actual risks related to exposures to one or more property segments fully secured by mortgages on residential property or on commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority, and if it considers that the inadequacy of the risk weights could adversely affect current or future financial stability in its Member State, it may increase the risk weights applicable to those exposures within the ranges determined in the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph or impose stricter criteria than those set out in Article 125(2) or 126(2).
The authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article shall notify EBA and the ESRB of any adjustments to risk weights and criteria applied pursuant to this paragraph. Within one month of receipt of that notification, EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned. EBA and the ESRB shall publish the risk weights and criteria for exposures referred to in Articles 125, 126 and point (a) of Article 199(1) as implemented by the relevant authority.
For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a may set the risk weights within the following ranges:
(a)
35 % to 150 % for exposures secured by mortgages on residential property;
(b)
50 % to 150 % for exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property.
3.   Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a sets higher risk weights or stricter criteria pursuant to the second subparagraph of paragraph 2, institutions shall have a six-month transitional period to apply them.
4.   EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value referred to in paragraph 1 and the types of factors to be considered for the assessment of the appropriateness of the risk weights referred in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2019.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
5.   The ESRB may, by means of recommendations in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, and in close cooperation with EBA, give guidance to authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article on the following:
(a)
factors which could ‘adversely affect current or future financial stability’ referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2; and
(b)
indicative benchmarks that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a is to take into account when determining higher risk weights.
6.   The institutions of a Member State shall apply the risk weights and criteria that have been determined by the authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 2 to all their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that Member State.’;

Own funds requirements for exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs
1.   Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU's exposures, calculated in accordance with the approaches referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, with the percentage of units or shares held by those institutions.
2.   Where the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article are met, institutions may apply the look-through approach in accordance with Article 132a(1) or the mandate-based approach in accordance with Article 132a(2).

By way of derogation from point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, multilateral and bilateral development banks and other institutions that co-invest in a CIU with multilateral or bilateral development banks may determine the risk-weighted exposure amount of that CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a, provided that the conditions set out in points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph are met and that the CIU's investment mandate limits the types of assets that the CIU can invest in to assets that promote sustainable development in developing countries.
Institutions shall notify their competent authority of the CIUs to which they apply the treatment referred to in the second subparagraph.
By way of derogation from point (c)(i) of the first subparagraph, where the institution determines the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the mandate-based approach, the reporting by the CIU or the CIU management company to the institution may be limited to the investment mandate of the CIU and any changes thereof and may be done only when the institution incurs the exposure to the CIU for the first time and when there is a change in the investment mandate of the CIU.
4.   Institutions that do not have adequate data or information to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a may rely on the calculations of a third party, provided that all the following conditions are met:

5.   Where an institution applies the approaches referred to in Article 132a for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures (‘level 1 CIU’), and any of the underlying exposures of the level 1 CIU is an exposure in the form of units or shares in another CIU (‘level 2 CIU’), the risk-weighted exposure amount of the level 2 CIU's exposures may be calculated by using any of the three approaches described in paragraph 2 of this Article. The institution may use the look-through approach to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs' exposures in level 3 and any subsequent level only where it used that approach for the calculation in the preceding level. In any other scenario it shall use the fall-back approach.
6.   The risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures calculated in accordance with the look-through approach and the mandate-based approach set out in Article 132a(1) and (2) shall be capped at the risk-weighted amount of that CIU's exposures calculated in accordance with the fall-back approach.
7.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions that apply the look-through approach in accordance with Article 132a(1) may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures, calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the risk weight (

) calculated in accordance with the formula set out in Article 132c, provided that the following conditions are met:
(a)
the institutions measure the value of their holdings of units or shares in a CIU at historical cost but measure the value of the underlying assets of the CIU at fair value if they apply the look-through approach;
(b)
a change in the market value of the units or shares for which institutions measure the value at historical cost changes neither the amount of own funds of those institutions nor the exposure value associated with those holdings.’;

Approaches for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs
1.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU shall look through to those exposures to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, risk weighting all underlying exposures of the CIU as if they were directly held by those institutions.
2.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU to use the look-through approach may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of those exposures in accordance with the limits set in the CIU's mandate and relevant law.
Institutions shall carry out the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph under the assumption that the CIU first incurs exposures to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law in the exposures attracting the highest own funds requirement and then continues incurring exposures in descending order until the maximum total exposure limit is reached, and that the CIU applies leverage to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law, where applicable.
Institutions shall carry out the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter, in Chapter 5, and in Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title.
3.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(3), institutions that calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article may calculate the own funds requirement for the credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative exposures of that CIU as an amount equal to 50 % of the own funds requirement for those derivative exposures calculated in accordance with Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title, as applicable.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivative exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were incurred directly by the institution.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount referred to in paragraph 2 where one or more of the inputs required for that calculation are not available.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 132b
Exclusions from the approaches for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs
1.   Institutions may exclude from the calculations referred to in Article 132 Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 instruments and eligible liabilities instruments held by a CIU which institutions shall deduct in accordance with Article 36(1) and Articles 56, 66 and 72e respectively.
2.   Institutions may exclude from the calculations referred to in Article 132 exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs referred to in points (g) and (h) of Article 150(1) and instead apply the treatment set out in Article 133 to those exposures.
Article 132c
Treatment of off-balance-sheet exposures to CIUs
1.   Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their off-balance-sheet items with the potential to be converted into exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the following risk weight:
(a)
for all exposures for which institutions use one of the approaches set out in Article 132a:





where:





=
the risk weight;
i
=
the index denoting the CIU:
RWAEi

=
the amount calculated in accordance with Article 132a for a CIUi;

the exposure value of the exposures of CIUi;
Ai

=
the accounting value of assets of CIUi; and
EQi

=
the accounting value of the equity of CIUi.
(b)





2.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a minimum value commitment that meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article as the discounted present value of the guaranteed amount using a default risk-free discount factor. Institutions may reduce the exposure value of the minimum value commitment by any losses recognised with respect to the minimum value commitment under the applicable accounting standard.
Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments that meet all the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article by multiplying the exposure value of those exposures by a conversion factor of 20 % and the risk weight derived under Article 132 or 152.
3.   Institutions shall determine the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments in accordance with paragraph 2 where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the off-balance-sheet exposure of the institution is a minimum value commitment for an investment into units or shares of one or more CIUs under which the institution is only obliged to pay out under the minimum value commitment where the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs is below a predetermined threshold at one or more points in time, as specified in the contract;
(b)
the CIU is any of the following:
(i)
a UCITS as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC; or
(ii)
an AIF as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU which solely invests in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets referred to in Article 50(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, where the mandate of the AIF does not allow a leverage higher than that allowed under Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;
(c)
the current market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU underlying the minimum value commitment without considering the effect of the off-balance-sheet minimum value commitments covers or exceeds the present value of the threshold specified in the minimum value commitment;
(d)
when the excess of the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs over the present value of the minimum value commitment declines, the institution, or another undertaking in so far as it is covered by the supervision on a consolidated basis to which the institution itself is subject in accordance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2002/87/EC, can influence the composition of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs or limit the potential for a further reduction of the excess in other ways;
(e)
the ultimate direct or indirect beneficiary of the minimum value commitment is typically a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.’;

2.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU shall look through to those underlying exposures to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, risk weighting all underlying exposures of the CIU as if they were directly held by the institutions.
3.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(3), institutions that calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article may calculate the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative exposures of that CIU as an amount equal to 50 % of the own funds requirement for those derivative exposures calculated in accordance with Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title, as applicable.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivative exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were incurred directly by the institution.

If an institution can decompose its EL estimates for dilution risk of purchased receivables into PDs and LGDs in a reliable manner, the institution may use its own LGD estimate.
2.   Unfunded credit protection may be recognised as eligible by adjusting PD or LGD estimates subject to requirements as specified in Article 183(1), (2) and (3) and the permission of the competent authorities either in support of an individual exposure or a pool of exposures. An institution shall not assign guaranteed exposures an adjusted PD or LGD such that the adjusted risk weight would be lower than that of a comparable, direct exposure to the guarantor.
3.   For the purposes of Article 154(2), the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider referred to in Article 153(3) shall either be the LGD associated with an unhedged facility to the guarantor or the unhedged facility of the obligor, depending upon whether, in the event both the guarantor and obligor default during the life of the hedged transaction, available evidence and the structure of the guarantee indicate that the amount recovered would depend on the financial condition of the guarantor or obligor, respectively.

Where an institution buys credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on the swap as net income, but does not record the offsetting deterioration in the value of the asset that is protected either through reductions in fair value or by an addition to reserves, that credit protection shall not qualify as eligible credit protection.

Where an internal hedge has been conducted in accordance with the first subparagraph and the requirements in this Chapter have been met, institutions shall apply the rules set out in Sections 4 to 6 of this Chapter for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts where they acquire unfunded credit protection.’;

(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value for the contracts listed in Annex II on the basis of one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 in accordance with this Article.
An institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a(1) shall not use the method set out in Section 4. An institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a(2) shall not use the method set out in Section 5.
Institutions may use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis within a group. A single institution shall not use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis.’;
(b)
paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 are replaced by the following:
‘6.   Under the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, the exposure value for a given counterparty shall be equal to the sum of the exposure values calculated for each netting set with that counterparty.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, where one margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets with that counterparty and the institution is using one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 to calculate the exposure value of those netting sets, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant Section.
For a given counterparty, the exposure value for a given netting set of OTC derivative instruments listed in Annex II calculated in accordance with this Chapter shall be the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of exposure values across all netting sets with the counterparty and the sum of credit valuation adjustments for that counterparty being recognised by the institution as an incurred write-down. The credit valuation adjustments shall be calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit value adjustment attributed to the own credit risk of the firm that has been already excluded from own funds in accordance with point (c) of Article 33(1).
7.   In calculating the exposure value in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5, institutions may treat two OTC derivative contracts included in the same netting agreement that are perfectly matching as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equal to zero.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, two OTC derivative contracts are perfectly matching when they meet all the following conditions:
(a)
their risk positions are opposite;
(b)
their features, with the exception of the trade date, are identical;
(c)
their cash flows fully offset each other.
8.   Institutions shall determine the exposure value for exposures arising from long settlement transactions by any of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, regardless of which method the institution has chosen for treating OTC derivatives and repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, and margin lending transactions. In calculating the own funds requirements for long settlement transactions, an institution that uses the approach set out in Chapter 3 may assign the risk weights under the approach set out in Chapter 2 on a permanent basis and irrespective of the materiality of those positions.’;
(c)
the following paragraph is added:
‘9.   For the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, institutions shall treat transactions where Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified in accordance with Article 291(2), (4), (5), and (6).’;

5.   Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the methods set out in Section 4 or 5 that they use, or cease to use, as applicable, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions.
6.   Institutions shall not enter into a derivative transaction or buy or sell a derivative instrument for the sole purpose of complying with any of the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 during the monthly assessment.
