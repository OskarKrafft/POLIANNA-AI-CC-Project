Article 282
Calculation of the exposure value
1.   Institutions may calculate a single exposure value for all the transactions within a contractual netting agreement where all the conditions set out in Article 274(1) are met. Otherwise, institutions shall calculate an exposure value separately for each transaction, which shall be treated as its own netting set.
2.   The exposure value of a netting set or a transaction shall be the product of 1,4 times the sum of the current replacement cost and the potential future exposure.
3.   The current replacement cost referred to in paragraph 2 shall be calculated as follows:
(a)
for netting sets of transactions: that are traded on a recognised exchange; centrally cleared by a central counterparty authorised in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 or recognised in accordance with Article 25 of that Regulation; or for which collateral is exchanged bilaterally with the counterparty in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, institutions shall use the following formula:
RC = TH + MTA
where:
RC
=
the replacement cost;
TH
=
the margin threshold applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement below which the institution cannot call for collateral; and
MTA
=
the minimum transfer amount applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement;
(b)
for all other netting sets or individual transactions, institutions shall use the following formula:
RC = max{CMV, 0}
where:
RC
=
the replacement cost; and
CMV
=
the current market value.
In order to calculate the current replacement cost, institutions shall update current market values at least monthly.
4.   Institutions shall calculate the potential future exposure referred to in paragraph 2 as follows:
(a)
the potential future exposure of a netting set is the sum of the potential future exposure of all the transactions included in the netting set, calculated in accordance with point (b);
(b)
the potential future exposure of a single transaction is its notional amount multiplied by:
(i)
the product of 0,5 % and the residual maturity of the transaction expressed in years for interest-rate derivative contracts;
(ii)
the product of 6 % and the residual maturity of the transaction expressed in years for credit derivative contracts;
(iii)
4 % for foreign-exchange derivatives;
(iv)
18 % for gold and commodity derivatives other than electricity derivatives;
(v)
40 % for electricity derivatives;
(vi)
32 % for equity derivatives;
(c)
the notional amount referred to in point (b) of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Article 279b(2) and (3) for all derivatives listed in that point; in addition, the notional amount of the derivatives referred to in points (b)(iii) to (b)(vi) of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with points (b) and (c) of Article 279b(1);
(d)
the potential future exposure of netting sets referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3 shall be multiplied by 0,42.
For calculating the potential exposure of interest-rate derivatives and credit derivatives in accordance with points b(i) and (b)(ii), an institution may choose to use the original maturity instead of the residual maturity of the contracts.’;
(75)
in Article 283, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:
‘4.   For all OTC derivative transactions, and for long settlement transactions for which an institution has not received permission under paragraph 1 to use the IMM, the institution shall use the methods set out in Section 3. Those methods may be used in combination on a permanent basis within a group.’;
(76)
Article 298 is replaced by the following:
‘Article 298
Effects of recognition of netting as risk-reducing
Netting for the purposes of Sections 3 to 6 shall be recognised as set out in those Sections.’;

by way of derogation from Article 285(3), where a netting set included in the calculation meets the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph, the institution may disregard the limit set out in that point, provided that the netting set does not meet the condition set out in point (b) of that paragraph and does not contain disputed trades or exotic options;
(d)
where a CCP retains variation margin against a transaction, and the institution's collateral is not protected against the insolvency of the CCP, the institution shall apply a margin period of risk that is the lower of one year and the remaining maturity of the transaction, with a floor of 10 business days.
