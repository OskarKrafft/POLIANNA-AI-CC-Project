Article 10
Reporting and review
1.   Every two years, with effect from 4 December 2010, the Commission shall prepare a report on the application of this Directive and on the actions taken by individual Member States to promote the purchase of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles.
2.   Those reports shall assess the effects of this Directive, especially of the options referred to in Article 5(3), and the need for further action, and include proposals, as appropriate.
In those reports, the Commission shall compare the nominal and relative numbers of vehicles purchased corresponding to the best market alternative in terms of lifetime energy and environmental impacts, within each of the categories of vehicles listed in Table 3 of the Annex, to the overall market for these vehicles and estimate how the options referred to in Article 5(3) have affected the market. The Commission shall assess the need for further action and include proposals, as appropriate.
3.   No later than the date of the first report, the Commission shall examine the options referred to in Article 5(3), present an evaluation of the methodology set out in Article 6 and propose appropriate adjustments, if necessary.
