Article 9
Public procurement and incentives
1.   Where a product is covered by a delegated act, contracting authorities which conclude public works, supply or service contracts as referred to in Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (8), which are not excluded by virtue of Articles 12 to 18 thereof, shall endeavour to procure only such products which comply with the criteria of having the highest performance levels and belonging to the highest energy efficiency class. Member States may also require the contracting authorities to procure only products fulfilling those criteria. Member States may make the application of those criteria subject to cost-effectiveness, economical feasibility and technical suitability and sufficient competition.
2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to contracts having a value equal to or greater than the thresholds laid down in Article 7 of Directive 2004/18/EC.
3.   Where Member States provide any incentives for a product covered by a delegated act they shall aim at the highest performance levels including the highest class of energy efficiency laid down in the applicable delegated act. Taxation and fiscal measures do not constitute incentives for the purpose of this Directive.
4.   Where Member States provide incentives for products, both for end-users using highly efficient products and for industries which promote and produce such products, they shall express the performance levels in terms of classes as defined in the applicable delegated act, except where they impose higher performance levels than the threshold for the highest energy efficiency class in the delegated act. Member States may impose higher performance levels than the threshold for the highest energy efficiency class in the delegated act.
