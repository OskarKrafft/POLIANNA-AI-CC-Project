Article 17
Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the appliance and the fitting or to their data plate as far as relevant. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the appliance or the fitting, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the documents accompanying the appliance or the fitting.

The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or his authorised representative.
4.   The CE marking and the identification number referred to in paragraph 3 may be followed by any other mark indicating a special risk or use.
5.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.
