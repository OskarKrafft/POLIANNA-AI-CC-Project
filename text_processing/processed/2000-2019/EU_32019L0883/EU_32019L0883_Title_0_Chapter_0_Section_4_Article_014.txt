Article 14
Recording of inspections
1.   The Commission shall develop, maintain and update an inspection database to which all Member States shall be connected and which shall contain all the information required for the implementation of the inspection system provided for by this Directive (‘the inspection database’). The inspection database shall be based on the inspection database referred to in Article 24 of Directive 2009/16/EC and shall have similar functionalities to that database.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the information related to inspections under this Directive, including information regarding non-compliance and prohibition of departure orders issued, is transferred without delay to the inspection database, as soon as:
(a)
the inspection report has been completed;
(b)
the prohibition of departure order has been lifted; or
(c)
an exemption has been granted.
3.   The Commission shall ensure that the inspection database makes it possible to retrieve any relevant data reported by the Member States for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of this Directive.
The Commission shall ensure that the inspection database provides information for the Union risk-based targeting mechanism referred to in Article 11(2).
The Commission shall regularly review the inspection database to monitor the implementation of this Directive and call attention to any doubts regarding comprehensive implementation with the aim of instigating corrective action.
4.   Member States shall at all times have access to the information recorded in the inspection database.
