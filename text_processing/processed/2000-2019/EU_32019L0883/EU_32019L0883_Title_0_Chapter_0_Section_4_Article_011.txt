Article 11
Inspection commitments
1.   Each Member State shall carry out inspections of ships calling in its ports corresponding to at least 15 % of the total number of individual ships calling in its ports annually.
The total number of individual ships calling in a Member State shall be calculated as the average number of individual ships over the previous three years, as reported through that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13.
2.   Member States shall comply with paragraph 1 of this Article by selecting ships on the basis of a Union risk-based targeting mechanism.
In order to ensure harmonisation of inspections and to provide for uniform conditions for selection of ships for inspection, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to define the detailed elements of the Union risk-based targeting mechanism. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 20(2).
3.   Member States shall establish procedures for inspections of ships that fall outside the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC in order to ensure, as far as practicable, compliance with this Directive.
When establishing those procedures, Member States may take into account the Union risk-based targeting mechanism referred to in paragraph 2.
4.   If the relevant authority of the Member State is not satisfied with the results of the inspection, it shall, without prejudice to the application of the penalties referred to in Article 16, ensure that the ship does not leave port until it has delivered its waste to a port reception facility in accordance with Article 7.
