Article 14
Critical levels
1.   Member States shall ensure compliance with the critical levels specified in Annex XIII as assessed in accordance with Section A of Annex III.
2.   Where fixed measurements are the sole source of information for assessing air quality, the number of sampling points shall not be less than the minimum number specified in Section C of Annex V. Where that information is supplemented by indicative measurements or modelling, the minimum number of sampling points may be reduced by up to 50 % so long as the assessed concentrations of the relevant pollutant can be established in accordance with the data quality objectives specified in Section A of Annex I.
