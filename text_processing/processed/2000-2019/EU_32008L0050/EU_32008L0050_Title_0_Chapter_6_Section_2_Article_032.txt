Article 32
Review
1.   In 2013 the Commission shall review the provisions related to PM2,5 and, as appropriate, other pollutants, and shall present a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.
As regards PM2,5, the review shall be undertaken with a view to establishing a legally binding national exposure reduction obligation in order to replace the national exposure reduction target and to review the exposure concentration obligation laid down in Article 15, taking into account, inter alia, the following elements:
—
latest scientific information from WHO and other relevant organisations,
—
air quality situations and reduction potentials in the Member States,
—
the revision of Directive 2001/81/EC,
—
progress made in implementing Community reduction measures for air pollutants,
2.   The Commission shall take into account the feasibility of adopting a more ambitious limit value for PM2,5, shall review the indicative limit value of the second stage for PM2,5 and consider confirming or altering that value.
3.   As part of the review, the Commission shall also prepare a report on the experience and on the necessity of monitoring of PM10 and PM2,5, taking into account technical progress in automatic measuring techniques. If appropriate, new reference methods for the measurement of PM10 and PM2,5 shall be proposed.
