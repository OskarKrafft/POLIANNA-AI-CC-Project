Article 21
Exceedances attributable to winter-sanding or -salting of roads
1.   Member States may designate zones or agglomerations within which limit values for PM10 are exceeded in ambient air due to the re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or -salting of roads.
2.   Member States shall send the Commission lists of any such zones or agglomerations together with information on concentrations and sources of PM10 therein.
3.   When informing the Commission in accordance with Article 27, Member States shall provide the necessary evidence to demonstrate that any exceedances are due to re-suspended particulates and that reasonable measures have been taken to lower the concentrations.
4.   Without prejudice to Article 20, in the case of zones and agglomerations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States need to establish the air quality plan provided for in Article 23 only in so far as exceedances are attributable to PM10 sources other than winter-sanding or -salting of roads.
5.   The Commission shall by 11 June 2010 publish guidelines for determination of contributions from the re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or -salting of roads.
