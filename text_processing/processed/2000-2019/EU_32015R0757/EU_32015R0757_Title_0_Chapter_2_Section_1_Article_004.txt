Article 4
Common principles for monitoring and reporting
1.   In accordance with Articles 8 to 12, companies shall, for each of their ships, monitor and report on the relevant parameters during a reporting period. They shall carry out that monitoring and reporting within all ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State and for any voyages to or from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State.
2.   Monitoring and reporting shall be complete and cover CO2 emissions from the combustion of fuels, while the ships are at sea as well as at berth. Companies shall apply appropriate measures to prevent any data gaps within the reporting period.
3.   Monitoring and reporting shall be consistent and comparable over time. To that end, companies shall use the same monitoring methodologies and data sets subject to modifications assessed by the verifier.
4.   Companies shall obtain, record, compile, analyse and document monitoring data, including assumptions, references, emission factors and activity data, in a transparent manner that enables the reproduction of the determination of CO2 emissions by the verifier.
5.   Companies shall ensure that the determination of CO2 emissions is neither systematically nor knowingly inaccurate. They shall identify and reduce any source of inaccuracies.
6.   Companies shall enable reasonable assurance of the integrity of the CO2 emission data to be monitored and reported.
7.   Companies shall endeavour to take account of the recommendations included in the verification reports issued pursuant to Article 13(3) or (4) in their subsequent monitoring and reporting.
