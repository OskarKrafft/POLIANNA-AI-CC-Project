Article 22
International cooperation
1.   The Commission shall inform the IMO and other relevant international bodies on a regular basis of the implementation of this Regulation, without prejudice to the distribution of competences or to decision-making procedures as provided for in the Treaties.
2.   The Commission and, where relevant, the Member States shall maintain technical exchange with third countries, in particular the further development of monitoring methods, the organisation of reporting and the verification of emissions reports.
3.   In the event that an international agreement on a global monitoring, reporting and verification system for greenhouse gas emissions or on global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport is reached, the Commission shall review this Regulation and shall, if appropriate, propose amendments to this Regulation in order to ensure alignment with that international agreement.
