(a)
in more developed regions:
(i)
at least 80 % of the total ERDF resources at national level shall be allocated to two or more of the thematic objectives set out in points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013; and
(ii)

(b)
in transition regions:
(i)
at least 60 % of the total ERDF resources at national level shall be allocated to two or more of the thematic objectives set out in points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013; and
(ii)
at least 15 % of the total ERDF resources at national level shall be allocated to the thematic objective set out in point 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013;
(c)
in less developed regions:
(i)
at least 50 % of the total ERDF resources at national level shall be allocated to two or more of the thematic objectives set in out in points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013; and
(ii)
at least 12 % of the total ERDF resources at national level shall be allocated to the thematic objective set out in point 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
For the purpose of this Article, regions whose GDP per capita used as an eligibility criterion for the 2007-2013 programming period was less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-25 for the reference period, and regions designated with phasing-out status in the 2007-2013 programming period, but which are eligible under the category of more developed regions as referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 in the 2014-2020 programming period, shall be considered as transition regions.
For the purpose of this Article, all NUTS level 2 regions consisting solely of island Member States or of islands which form part of Member States which receive support from the Cohesion Fund, and all outermost regions, shall be considered as less developed regions.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, the minimum ERDF share allocated to a category of region may be lower than that set out in that paragraph, provided that such a decrease is compensated by an increase in the share allocated to other categories of regions. The resulting sum at national level of the amounts for all categories of region respectively for the thematic objectives set out in points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1300/2013 and those set out in point 4 of the first paragraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall accordingly not be less than the sum at national level resulting from applying the minimum ERDF shares set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, Cohesion Fund resources allocated to supporting the investment priorities set out in point (a) of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1300/2013 may be counted towards achieving the minimum shares set out in points (a)(ii), (b)(ii) and (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article. In such a case, the share referred to in point (c)(ii) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be increased to 15 %. Where applicable, those resources shall be allocated pro rata to the different categories of region based on their relative shares of the total population of the Member State concerned.
