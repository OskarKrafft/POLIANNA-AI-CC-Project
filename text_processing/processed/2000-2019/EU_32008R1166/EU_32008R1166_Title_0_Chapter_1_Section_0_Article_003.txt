Article 3
Coverage
1.   The surveys specified in this Regulation shall cover:
(a)
agricultural holdings where the agricultural area utilised for farming is one hectare or more;
(b)
agricultural holdings where the agricultural area utilised for farming is less than one hectare, if those holdings produce a certain proportion for sale or if their production unit exceeds certain physical thresholds.
2.   However, Member States which use a survey threshold above one hectare shall fix this threshold at a level that excludes only the smallest agricultural holdings which together contribute 2 % or less to the total utilised agricultural area excluding common land and 2 % or less to the total number of farm livestock units.
3.   In any case, all agricultural holdings reaching one of the physical thresholds specified in Annex II shall be covered.
