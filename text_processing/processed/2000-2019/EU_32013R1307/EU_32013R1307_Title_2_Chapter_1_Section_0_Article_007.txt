Article 7
Net ceilings
1.   Without prejudice to Article 8, the total amount of direct payments which may be granted in a Member State pursuant to Titles III, IV and V in respect of a calendar year, after application of Article 11, shall not be higher than the corresponding ceiling set out in Annex III.
Where the total amount of direct payments to be granted in a Member State would be higher than the ceiling set out in Annex III, that Member State shall make a linear reduction in the amounts of all direct payments with the exception of direct payments granted under Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 229/2013.
2.   For each Member State and for each calendar year, the estimated product of the reduction of payments referred to in Article 11 (which is reflected by the difference between the national ceiling set out in Annex II, to which is added the amount available in accordance with Article 58, and the net ceiling set out in Annex III) shall be made available as Union support for measures under rural development programming financed under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) as specified in Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.
3.   In order to take account of the developments relating to the total maximum amounts of direct payments that may be granted, including those resulting from the decisions taken by Member States pursuant to Article 14, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 70 adapting the ceilings set out in Annex III.
