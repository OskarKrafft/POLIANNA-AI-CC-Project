Article 28
Windfall profit
For the purposes of Article 25(4) to (7) and Article 26, a Member State may, on the basis of objective criteria, provide that, in cases of sale or grant or expiry of all or part of a lease of agricultural areas after the date fixed pursuant to Article 35 or Article 124(2) of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 73/2009 and before the date fixed pursuant to Article 33(1) of this Regulation, the increase, or part of the increase, in the value of payment entitlements that would be allocated to the farmer concerned is to revert to the national reserve or regional reserves where the increase would lead to a windfall profit for the farmer concerned.
Those objective criteria shall be established in such a way as to ensure the equal treatment of farmers and to avoid distortions of the market and of competition and shall include, at least, the following:
(a)
a minimum duration for the lease; and
(b)
the proportion of the payment received which shall revert to the national reserve or regional reserves.
