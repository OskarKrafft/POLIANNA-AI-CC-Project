Article 44
Crop diversification
1.   Where the arable land of the farmer covers between 10 and 30 hectares and is not entirely cultivated with crops under water for a significant part of the year or for a significant part of the crop cycle, there shall be at least two different crops on that arable land. The main crop shall not cover more than 75 % of that arable land.
Where the arable land of the farmer covers more than 30 hectares and is not entirely cultivated with crops under water for a significant part of the year or for a significant part of the crop cycle, there shall be at least three different crops on that arable land. The main crop shall not cover more than 75 % of that arable land and the two main crops together shall not cover more than 95 % of that arable land.
2.   Without prejudice to the number of crops required pursuant to paragraph 1, the maximum thresholds set out therein shall not apply to holdings where grasses or other herbaceous forage or land lying fallow cover more than 75 % of the arable land. In such cases, the main crop on the remaining arable area shall not cover more than 75 % of that remaining arable land, except where this remaining area is covered by grasses or other herbaceous forage or land lying fallow.
3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to holdings:
(a)
where more than 75 % of the arable land is used for the production of grasses or other herbaceous forage, is land lying fallow, or is subject to a combination of these uses, provided that the arable area not covered by these uses does not exceed 30 hectares;
(b)
where more than 75 % of the eligible agricultural area is permanent grassland, is used for the production of grasses or other herbaceous forage or for the cultivation of crops under water for a significant part of the year or for a significant part of the crop cycle, or is subject to a combination of these uses, provided that the arable area not covered by these uses does not exceed 30 hectares;
(c)
where more than 50 % of the areas of arable land declared were not declared by the farmer in his aid application of the previous year and, where based on a comparison of the geo-spatial aid applications, all arable land is being cultivated with a different crop compared to that of the previous calendar year;
(d)
that are situated in areas north of 62nd parallel or certain adjacent areas. Where the arable land of such holdings covers more than 10 hectares, there shall be at least two crops on the arable land, and none of these crops shall cover more than 75 % of the arable land, unless the main crop is grasses or other herbaceous forage, or land lying fallow.
4.   For the purposes of this Article, a "crop" means any of the following:
(a)
a culture of any of the different genera defined in the botanical classification of crops;
(b)
a culture of any of the species in the case of Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, and Cucurbitaceae;
(c)
land lying fallow;
(d)
grasses or other herbaceous forage.
Winter crop and spring crop shall be considered to be distinct crops even if they belong to the same genus.
5.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 70:
(a)
recognising other types of genera and species than those referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article; and
(b)
laying down the rules concerning the application of the precise calculation of shares of different crops.
