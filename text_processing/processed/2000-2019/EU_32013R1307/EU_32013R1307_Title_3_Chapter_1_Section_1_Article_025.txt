Article 25
Value of payment entitlements and convergence
1.   In 2015, Member States shall calculate the unit value of payment entitlements by dividing a fixed percentage of the national ceiling set out in Annex II for each relevant year by the number of payment entitlements in 2015 at national or regional level, excluding those allocated from the national reserve or regional reserves in 2015.
The fixed percentage referred to in the first subparagraph shall be calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic payment scheme to be set in accordance with, respectively, Article 22(1) or Article 23(2) of this Regulation for 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in paragraph 1 or, where applicable, paragraph 2 of Article 30, by the national ceiling for 2015 set out in Annex II. The payment entitlements shall be expressed in a number that corresponds to a number of hectares.
2.   By way of derogation from the calculation method referred to in paragraph 1, Member States may decide to differentiate the value of payment entitlements in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve or regional reserves in 2015, for each relevant year on the basis of their initial unit value as calculated in accordance with Article 26.
3.   From claim year 2019 at the latest, all payment entitlements in a Member State or, where Article 23 is applied, in a region shall have a uniform unit value.
4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, a Member State may decide that payment entitlements with an initial unit value as calculated in accordance with Article 26 that is lower than 90 % of the national or regional unit value in 2019 shall, for claim year 2019 at the latest, have their unit value increased by at least one third of the difference between their initial unit value and 90 % of the national or regional unit value in 2019.
Member States may decide to set the percentage referred to in the first subparagraph at a level higher than 90 % but not above 100 %.
In addition, Member States shall provide that, at the latest for claim year 2019, no payment entitlement shall have a unit value lower than 60 % of the national or regional unit value in 2019, unless this would, in Member States applying the threshold referred to in paragraph 7, result in a maximum decrease exceeding that threshold. In such cases, the minimum unit value shall be set at a level necessary to respect that threshold.
5.   The national or regional unit value in 2019 referred to in the paragraph 4 shall be calculated by dividing a fixed percentage of the national ceiling set out in Annex II, or of the regional ceiling, for calendar year 2019 by the number of payment entitlements in 2015 in the Member State or region concerned, excluding those allocated from the national reserve or regional reserves in 2015. That fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic payment scheme to be set in accordance with, respectively, Article 22(1) or Article 23(2) for the year 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in paragraph 1 or, where applicable, paragraph 2 of Article 30, by the national ceiling set out in Annex II, or the regional ceiling, for 2015.
6.   The regional ceilings referred to in the paragraph 5 shall be calculated by applying a fixed percentage to the national ceiling set out in Annex II for the year 2019. That fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the respective regional ceilings established in accordance with Article 23(2) for the year 2015 by the national ceiling to be set in accordance with Article 22(1) for the year 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in Article 30(1) where the second subparagraph of Article 23(2) applies.
7.   In order to finance the increases in the value of payment entitlements referred to in paragraph 4, where payment entitlements have an initial unit value higher than the national or regional unit value in 2019, the difference between their initial unit value and the national or regional unit value in 2019 shall be decreased on the basis of objective and non-discriminative criteria to be determined by Member States. Such criteria may include the fixing of a maximum decrease of the initial unit value of 30 %.
8.   When applying paragraph 2 of this Article, the transition from the initial unit value of payment entitlements as calculated in accordance with Article 26 to their final unit value in 2019 as established in accordance with paragraph 3 or paragraphs 4 to 7 of this Article shall be made in equal steps starting from 2015.
In order to ensure compliance with the fixed percentage referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article for each year, the value of the payment entitlements with an initial unit value that is higher than the national or regional unit value in 2019 shall be adjusted.
9.   By way of derogation from paragraph 8 of this Article, where Member States which, in accordance with Article 21(3), decide to keep their existing entitlements apply paragraph 2 of this Article, the transition from the initial unit value of payment entitlements as established in accordance with Article 26(5) to their final unit value in 2019 as established in accordance with paragraph 3 or paragraphs 4 to 7 of this Article shall, where applicable, be made by applying the steps decided nationally in accordance with Article 63(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
In order to ensure compliance with the fixed percentage referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article for each year, the value of all payment entitlements shall be linearly adjusted.
10.   In 2015, Member States shall inform farmers of the value of their payment entitlements as calculated in accordance with this Article and Articles 26 and 27 for each year of the period covered by this Regulation.
