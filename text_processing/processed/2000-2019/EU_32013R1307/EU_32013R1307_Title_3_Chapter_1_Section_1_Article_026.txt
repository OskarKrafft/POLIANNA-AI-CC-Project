Article 26
Calculation of the initial unit value
1.   The initial unit value of payment entitlements referred to in Article 25(2) in Member States which apply the single payment scheme in calendar year 2014 and which have not decided to keep their existing payment entitlements in accordance with Article 21(3) shall be set in accordance with either of the methods set out in paragraphs 2 or 3.
2.   A fixed percentage of the payments the farmer received for 2014 under the single payment scheme, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, before reductions and exclusions provided for in Chapter 4 of Title II of that Regulation, shall be divided by the number of payment entitlements he is allocated in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve or regional reserves in 2015.
That fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic payment scheme to be set in accordance with, respectively, Article 22(1) or Article 23(2) of this Regulation for the year 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in paragraph 1 or, where applicable, paragraph 2 of Article 30 of this Regulation, by the amount of the payments for 2014 under the single payment scheme in the Member State or region concerned, before reductions and exclusions provided for in Chapter 4 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
3.   A fixed percentage of the value of the entitlements, including special entitlements, which the farmer held on the date of submission of his application for 2014 under the single payment scheme, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, shall be divided by the number of payment entitlements he is allocated in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve or regional reserves in 2015.
That fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic payment scheme to be set in accordance with, respectively, Article 22(1) or Article 23(2) of this Regulation for the year 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in paragraph 1 or, where applicable, paragraph 2 of Article 30 of this Regulation, by the total value of all entitlements, including special entitlements, in the Member State or region concerned for 2014, under the single payment scheme.
For the purpose of this paragraph, a farmer shall be considered to hold payment entitlements on the date of submission of his application for 2014 where payment entitlements were allocated or definitively transferred to him by that date.
4.   Member States which apply the single area payment scheme in calendar year 2014 shall calculate the initial unit value of payment entitlements referred to in Article 25(2) of this Regulation by dividing a fixed percentage of the total value of aid the farmer received for 2014 under the single area payment scheme in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and under Articles 132 and 133a of that Regulation, before reductions and exclusions provided for in Chapter 4 of Title II of that Regulation, by the number of payment entitlements he is allocated in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve or regional reserves in 2015.
That fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic payment scheme to be set in accordance with, respectively, Article 22(1) or Article 23(2) of this Regulation for the year 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in paragraph 1 or, where applicable, paragraph 2 of Article 30 of this Regulation, by the total value of aid granted under the single area payment scheme in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and under Articles 132 and 133a of that Regulation for 2014 in the Member State or region concerned, before reductions and exclusions provided for in Chapter 4 of Title II of that Regulation.
5.   Member States which apply the single payment scheme in calendar year 2014 and which, in accordance with Article 21(3) of this Regulation, decide to keep their existing payment entitlements shall calculate the initial unit value of payment entitlements referred to in Article 25(2) of this Regulation by multiplying the unit value of the entitlements by a fixed percentage. That fixed percentage shall be calculated by dividing the national or regional ceiling for the basic payment scheme to be set in accordance with, respectively, Article 22(1) or Article 23(2) of this Regulation for the year 2015, after applying the linear reduction provided for in paragraph 1 or, where applicable, paragraph 2 of Article 30 of this Regulation, by the amount of the payments for 2014 under the single payment scheme in the Member State or region concerned, before reductions and exclusions provided for in Chapter 4 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
6.   For the purposes of calculation methods provided for in this Article, provided that the relevant sectors do not receive any voluntary coupled support pursuant to Title IV of this Regulation, Member States may also take into account the support granted for calendar year 2014 under one or more of the schemes pursuant to Article 52, Article 53(1) and points (a) and (b) of Article 68(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and, as regards Member States which applied the single area payment scheme in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, pursuant to point (c) of Article 68(1) and Articles 126, 127 and 129 of that Regulation.
Member States which decide to apply the voluntary coupled support pursuant to Title IV of this Regulation may take into account the differences between the level of support granted in calendar year 2014 and the level of support to be granted in accordance with Title IV of this Regulation when applying a calculation method provided for in this Article, provided that:
(a)
the voluntary coupled support pursuant to Title IV of this Regulation is granted to a sector which was granted support in calendar year 2014 pursuant to Article 52, Article 53(1) and points (a) and (b) of Article 68(1) and, for Member States which applied the single area payment scheme, pursuant to point (c) of Article 68(1) and Articles 126, 127 and 129 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009; and
(b)
the amount per unit of the voluntary coupled support is lower than the amount per unit of the support in 2014.
