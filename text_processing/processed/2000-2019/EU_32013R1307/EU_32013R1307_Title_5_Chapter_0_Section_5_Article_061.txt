Article 61
General rules
1.   Member States may establish a scheme for small farmers in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Title ("small farmers scheme").
Farmers who, in 2015, hold owned or leased-in payment entitlements or, in Member States applying Article 36, claim for the single area payment scheme, and fulfil the minimum requirements provided for in Article 10(1) may opt to participate in the small farmers scheme.
2.   Payments under the small farmers scheme shall replace the payments to be granted pursuant to Titles III and IV.
The first subparagraph shall not apply where a Member State opts for the payment method laid down in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 63(2). In that case, the payment shall be subject to the respective conditions laid down in Titles III and IV, without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article.
3.   Farmers participating in the small farmers scheme shall be exempted from the agricultural practices provided for in Chapter 3 of Title III.
4.   No advantage provided for under this Title shall be granted in favour of farmers in respect of whom it is established that they artificially created, after 18 October 2011, the conditions to benefit from the small farmers scheme.
