Article 62
Participation
1.   Farmers wishing to participate in the small farmers scheme shall submit an application by a date to be fixed by Member States which shall not be later than 15 October 2015. The date fixed by Member States cannot, however, be earlier than the last day for submitting an application under the basic payment scheme or the single area payment scheme.
Farmers who have not applied to participate in the small farmers scheme on the date fixed by the Member State, who decide to withdraw from it after that date or who have been selected for support under point (c) of Article 19(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 shall no longer be entitled to participate in that scheme.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may provide that farmers whose amount of direct payments under Titles III and IV is lower than the maximum amount fixed by the Member State in accordance with Article 63 are to be included in the small farmers scheme automatically, unless they expressly withdraw from it by the date fixed by the Member State in accordance with paragraph 1 or in any subsequent year. Member States making use of this possibility shall inform the relevant farmers in due time about their right to withdraw from the scheme.
3.   Each Member State shall ensure that an estimate of the amount of the payment referred to in Article 63 is made known to farmers in due time before the date for submitting applications or for withdrawal fixed by that Member State.
