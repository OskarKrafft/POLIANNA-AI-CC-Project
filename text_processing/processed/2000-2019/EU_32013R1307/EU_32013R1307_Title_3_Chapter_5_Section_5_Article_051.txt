Article 51
Financial provisions
1.   In order to finance the payment for young farmers, Member States shall use a percentage, which shall not be higher than 2 %, of the annual national ceiling set out in Annex II. The Member States shall notify the Commission, by 1 August 2014, of the estimated percentage necessary to finance that payment.
Member States may, by 1 August of each year, revise their estimated percentage with effect from the subsequent year. They shall notify the Commission of the revised percentage by 1 August of the year preceding its application.
2.   Without prejudice to the maximum of 2 % laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article, where the total amount of the payment for young farmers applied for in a Member State in a particular year exceeds the ceiling set pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, and where that ceiling is lower than that maximum, that Member State shall finance the difference by applying point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 30(7) in the relevant year, by applying a linear reduction to all payments to be granted to all farmers in accordance with Article 32 or Article 36(2), or by both means.
3.   Where the total amount of the payment for young farmers applied for in a Member State in a particular year exceeds the ceiling set pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, and where that ceiling amount to 2 % of the annual national ceiling set out in Annex II, Member States shall apply a linear reduction to the amounts to be paid pursuant to Article 50 in order to comply with that ceiling.
4.   On the basis of the percentage notified by Member States pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts fixing the corresponding ceilings for the payment for young farmers on a yearly basis.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 71(2).
