Article 36
Single area payment scheme
1.   Member States applying in 2014 the single area payment scheme laid down in Chapter 2 of Title V of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 may, under the conditions set out in this Regulation, decide to continue to apply that scheme until 31 December 2020 at the latest. They shall notify the Commission of their decision and of the end date of the application of that scheme by 1 August 2014.
During the period of application of the single area payment scheme, Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Chapter shall not apply to those Member States, with the exception of the second subparagraph of Article 23(1), Article 23(6) as well as Article 32(2) to (6).
2.   The single area payment shall be granted on an annual basis for each eligible hectare declared by the farmer in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 72(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. It shall be calculated each year by dividing the annual financial envelope established in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article by the total number of eligible hectares declared in the Member State concerned in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 72(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, Member States that decide to apply Article 38 of this Regulation from 1 January 2018 at the latest may use, for the period during which they apply this Article, up to 20 % of the annual financial envelope referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article to differentiate the single area payment per hectare.
When doing so, they shall take into account the support granted for calendar year 2014 under one or more of the schemes pursuant to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 68(1) and Articles 126, 127 and 129 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
Cyprus may differentiate the aid taking into account the sector-specific financial envelopes set out in Annex XVIIa of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, reduced by any aid granted to the same sector pursuant to Article 37 of this Regulation.
4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting, for each Member State, the annual national ceiling for the single area payment scheme by deducting from the annual national ceiling set out in Annex II the ceilings fixed in accordance with Articles 42, 47, 49, 51 and 53. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 71(2).
5.   Except in the case of force majeure or exceptional circumstances, the hectares referred to in paragraph 2 shall be at the farmer's disposal on a date fixed by the Member State, which shall be no later than the date fixed in that Member State for amendment of the aid application referred to in Article 72(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
6.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 70 concerning rules on eligibility and the access of farmers to the single area payment scheme.
