Article 24
First allocation of payment entitlements
1.   Payment entitlements shall be allocated to farmers who are entitled to be granted direct payments in accordance with Article 9 of this Regulation provided that:
(a)
they apply for allocation of payment entitlements under the basic payment scheme by the final date for submission of applications in 2015 to be set in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 78 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, except in case of force majeure or exceptional circumstances; and
(b)
they were entitled to receive payments, before any reduction or exclusion provided for in Chapter 4 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, in respect of an aid application for direct payments, for transitional national aid or for complementary national direct payments in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for 2013.
The first subparagraph shall not apply in Member States applying Article 21(3) of this Regulation.
Member States may allocate payment entitlements to farmers who are entitled to be granted direct payments in accordance with Article 9 of this Regulation, who fulfil the condition provided for in point (a) of the first subparagraph and who:
(a)
did not receive payments for 2013 in respect of an aid application as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and who, on the date fixed by the Member State concerned in accordance with Article 11(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 (22) for the claim year 2013:
(i)
in Member States applying the single payment scheme:
—
were producing fruits, vegetables, ware potatoes, seed potatoes or ornamental plants, and did so on a minimum area expressed in hectares if the Member State concerned decides to adopt such a requirement, or
—
were cultivating vineyards; or
(ii)
in Member States applying the single area payment scheme, had only agricultural land that was not in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 as provided for in Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009;
(b)
in 2014, are allocated payment entitlements from the national reserve under the single payment scheme pursuant to Article 41 or 57 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009; or
(c)
never held owned or leased-in payment entitlements established under Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 or Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and who submit verifiable evidence that, on the date fixed by the Member State in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 for the claim year 2013, they produced, reared or grew agricultural products, including through harvesting, milking, breeding animals and keeping animals for farming purposes. Member States may establish their own additional objective and non-discriminatory eligibility criteria for this category of farmers as regards appropriate skills, experience or education.
2.   Except in the case of force majeure or exceptional circumstances, the number of payment entitlements allocated per farmer in 2015 shall be equal to the number of eligible hectares, which the farmer declares in his aid application in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 72(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 for 2015 and which are at his disposal on a date fixed by the Member State. That date shall be no later than the date fixed in that Member State for amending such an aid application.
3.   Member States may apply one or more of the limitations, as set out in paragraphs 4 to 7, on the number of payment entitlements to be allocated under paragraph 2.
4.   Member States may decide that the number of payment entitlements to be allocated shall be equal to either the number of eligible hectares which the farmer declared in accordance with Article 34(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in 2013, or the number of eligible hectares referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, whichever is the lowest. For Croatia, the use of this option shall be without prejudice to the allocation of payment entitlements for de–mined hectares in accordance with Article 20(4) of this Regulation.
5.   Where the total number of eligible hectares referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article declared in a Member State would result in an increase of more than 35 % of the total number of eligible hectares declared in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in 2009, or in the case of Croatia in 2013, Member States may limit the number of payment entitlements to be allocated in 2015 to a minimum of either 135 % or 145 % of the total number of eligible hectares declared in 2009, or, in the case of Croatia, of the total number of eligible hectares declared in 2013, in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
When using this option, Member States shall allocate a reduced number of payment entitlements to farmers. That number shall be calculated by applying a proportional reduction to the additional number of eligible hectares declared by each farmer in 2015 compared to the number of eligible hectares within the meaning of Article 34(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 that that farmer declared in his aid application in 2011 or, in the case of Croatia, in 2013, without prejudice to the de-mined hectares for which payment entitlements are to be allocated in accordance with Article 20(4) of this Regulation.
6.   Member States may decide to apply, for the purposes of establishing the number of payment entitlements to be allocated to a farmer, a reduction coefficient to those eligible hectares referred to in paragraph 2 which consist of permanent grassland located in areas with difficult climate conditions, especially due to their altitude and other natural constraints such as poor soil quality, steepness and water supply.
7.   Member States may decide that the number of payment entitlements to be allocated to a farmer shall be equal to the number of eligible hectares referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which were not hectares of vineyards on the date fixed by the Member State in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 for the claim year 2013 or hectares of arable land under permanent greenhouses.
8.   In the case of the sale or lease of their holding or part of it, natural or legal persons complying with paragraph 1 of this Article may, by contract signed before the final date for submitting applications in 2015 to be set in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 78 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, transfer the right to receive payment entitlements in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article to one or more farmers provided that the latter comply with the conditions laid down in Article 9 of this Regulation.
9.   A Member State may decide to fix a minimum size per holding, expressed in eligible hectares, in respect of which the farmer may apply for an allocation of payment entitlements. That minimum size shall not exceed the threshold set out in point (b) of Article 10(1) in conjunction with paragraph 2 of that Article.
10.   Member States shall, where relevant, notify the Commission of the decisions referred to in this Article by 1 August 2014.
11.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down rules on applications for the allocation of payment entitlements submitted in the year of allocation of payment entitlements where those payment entitlements may not yet be definitively established and where that allocation is affected by specific circumstances. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 71(2).
