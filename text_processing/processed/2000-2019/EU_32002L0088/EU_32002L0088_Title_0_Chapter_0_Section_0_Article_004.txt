Article 3
Not later than 11 August 2004, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report and, if appropriate, a proposal regarding the potential costs, benefits and feasibility of:
(a) reducing particulate emissions from small spark ignition engines with special attention to two stroke engines. The report shall take into account:
(i) estimates of the contribution of such engines to the emission of particles, and the way proposed emission reduction measures could contribute towards improving air quality and reduced health effects;
(ii) tests, measurement procedures and equipment which could be used to assess particulate emissions from small spark ignition engines at type approval;
(iii) work and conclusion within the particulate measurement programme;
(iv) developments in test procedures, engine technology, exhaust purification as well as enhanced standards for fuel and engine oil; and
(v) costs of reducing particulate emissions from small spark ignition engines and the cost effectiveness of any proposed measures;
(b) reducing emissions from those recreational vehicles, including snowmobiles and go-carts, currently not covered;
(c) reducing exhaust gas and particulate emissions from small compression ignition engines under 18 Kw;
(d) reducing exhaust gas and particulate emissions from locomotive compression ignition engines. A test cycle should be formulated in order to measure such emissions.
