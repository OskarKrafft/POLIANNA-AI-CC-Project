Article 3
Making available on the market and putting into service
1.   Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that pressure equipment and assemblies may be made available on the market and put into service only if they satisfy the requirements of this Directive when properly installed and maintained and used for the purposes for which they are intended.
2.   This Directive shall not affect Member States’ entitlement to lay down such requirements as they may deem necessary to ensure that persons and, in particular, workers are protected during use of the pressure equipment or assembly in question provided that this does not mean modifications to such equipment or assembly in a way not specified in this Directive.
3.   At trade fairs, exhibitions, demonstrations and other similar events, Member States shall not prevent the showing of pressure equipment or assemblies which do not comply with this Directive, provided that a visible sign clearly indicates that such pressure equipment or assemblies may not be made available on the market and/or put into service until they are brought into conformity. During demonstrations, appropriate safety measures shall be taken in accordance with any requirements laid down by the competent authority of the Member State concerned in order to ensure the safety of persons.
