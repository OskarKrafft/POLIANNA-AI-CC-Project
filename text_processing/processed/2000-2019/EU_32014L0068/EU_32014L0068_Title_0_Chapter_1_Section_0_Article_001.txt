(j)
equipment comprising casings or machinery where the dimensioning, choice of material and manufacturing rules are based primarily on requirements for sufficient strength, rigidity and stability to meet the static and dynamic operational effects or other operational characteristics and for which pressure is not a significant design factor; such equipment may include:
(i)
engines including turbines and internal combustion engines;
(ii)
steam engines, gas/steam turbines, turbo-generators, compressors, pumps and actuating devices;
(k)
blast furnaces including the furnace cooling system, hot-blast recuperators, dust extractors and blast-furnace exhaust-gas scrubbers and direct reducing cupolas, including the furnace cooling, gas converters and pans for melting, re-melting, de-gassing and casting of steel, iron and non-ferrous metals;

(m)
pressurised pipes for the containment of transmission systems, e.g. for electrical power and telephone cables;
(n)
ships, rockets, aircraft and mobile off-shore units, as well as equipment specifically intended for installation on board or the propulsion thereof;
(o)
pressure equipment consisting of a flexible casing, e.g. tyres, air cushions, balls used for play, inflatable craft, and other similar pressure equipment;
(p)
exhaust and inlet silencers;
(q)
bottles or cans for carbonated drinks for final consumption;
(r)
vessels designed for the transport and distribution of drinks having a PS·V of not more than 500 bar·L and a maximum allowable pressure not exceeding 7 bar;
