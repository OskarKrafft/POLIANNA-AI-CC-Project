Article 32
Changes to notifications
1.   Where a notifying authority has ascertained or has been informed that a notified body or a recognised third-party organisation no longer meets the requirements laid down in Article 24 or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the notifying authority shall, as appropriate, restrict, suspend or withdraw the notification, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.
Where a notifying authority has ascertained or has been informed that a user inspectorate no longer meets the requirements laid down in Article 25, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the notifying authority shall as appropriate, restrict, suspend or withdraw the notification, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.
2.   In the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of notification, or where the notified body, the recognised third-party organisation or the user inspectorate has ceased its activity, the notifying Member State shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that body are either processed by another notified body, recognised third-party organisation or user inspectorate, or kept available for the responsible notifying and market surveillance authorities at their request.
