(b)
the assessment of the integration of the various components of the assembly as referred to in points 2.3, 2.8 and 2.9 of Annex I which shall be determined by the highest category applicable to the equipment concerned other than that applicable to any safety accessories;

the assessment of the protection of an assembly against exceeding the permissible operating limits as referred to in points 2.10 and 3.2.3 of Annex I shall be conducted in the light of the highest category applicable to the items of equipment to be protected.
7.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the competent authorities may, where justified, allow the making available on the market and putting into service in the territory of the Member State concerned of individual pressure equipment items and assemblies referred to in Article 2, in respect of which the procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article have not been applied and the use of which is in the interests of experimentation.
8.   The records and correspondence relating to conformity assessment procedures shall be drafted in an official language of the Member State where the body responsible for carrying out these conformity assessment procedures is established, or in a language accepted by that body.
