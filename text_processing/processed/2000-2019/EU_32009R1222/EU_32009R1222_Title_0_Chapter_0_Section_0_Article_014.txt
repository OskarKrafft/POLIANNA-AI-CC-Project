Article 14
Review
1.   The Commission shall assess the need to review this Regulation, taking into account, inter alia:
(a)
the effectiveness of the label in terms of end-user awareness, in particular whether the provisions of Article 4(1)(b) are as effective as those of Article 4(1)(a) in contributing to the objectives of this Regulation;
(b)
whether the labelling scheme should be extended to include retreaded tyres;
(c)
whether new tyre parameters, such as mileage, should be introduced;
(d)
the information on tyre parameters provided by vehicle suppliers and distributors to end-users.
2.   The Commission shall present the result of this assessment to the European Parliament and the Council no later than 1 March 2016, and, if appropriate, submit proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council.
