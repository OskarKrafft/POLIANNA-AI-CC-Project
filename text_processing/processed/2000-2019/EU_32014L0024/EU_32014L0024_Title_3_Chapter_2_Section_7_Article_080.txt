Article 80
Rules on the organisation of design contests and the selection of participants
1.   When organising design contests, contracting authorities shall apply procedures which are adapted to the provisions of Title I and this Chapter.
2.   The admission of participants to design contests shall not be limited:
(a)
by reference to the territory or part of the territory of a Member State;
(b)
on the grounds that, under the law of the Member State in which the contest is organised, they would be required to be either natural or legal persons.
3.   Where design contests are restricted to a limited number of participants, the contracting authorities shall lay down clear and non-discriminatory selection criteria. In any event, the number of candidates invited to participate shall be sufficient to ensure genuine competition.
