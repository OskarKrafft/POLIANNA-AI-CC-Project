Article 85
National reporting and statistical information
1.   The Commission shall review the quality and completeness of data that can be extracted from the notices, referred to in Articles 48, 49, 50, 75 and 79, which are published in accordance with Annex VIII.
Where the quality and completeness of the data referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is not compliant with the obligations stipulated in Article 48(1), Article 49, Article 50(1), Article 75(2) and Article 79(3), the Commission shall request complementary information from the Member State concerned. Within a reasonable time, the Member State concerned shall supply the missing statistical information requested by the Commission.
2.   By 18 April 2017 and every three years thereafter, Member States shall forward to the Commission a statistical report for procurement which would have been covered by this Directive if its value had exceeded the relevant threshold laid down in Article 4, indicating an estimation of the aggregated total value of such procurement during the period concerned. That estimation may in particular be based on data available under national publication requirements or on sample-based estimates.
That report may be included in the report referred to in Article 83(3).
3.   Member States shall make available to the Commission information on their institutional organisation related to the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of this Directive, as well as on national initiatives taken to provide guidance on or assist in implementation of Union rules on public procurement, or to respond to challenges confronting the implementation of those rules.
That information may be included in the report referred to in Article 83(3).
