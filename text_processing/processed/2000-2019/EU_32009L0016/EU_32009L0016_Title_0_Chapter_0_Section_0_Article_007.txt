Article 7
Modalities allowing a balanced inspection share within the Community
1.   A Member State in which the total number of calls of Priority I ships exceeds its inspection share referred to in Article 5(2)(b), shall be regarded as complying with such commitment, if a number of inspections on Priority I ships carried out by that Member State corresponds at least to such inspection share and if that Member State does not miss more than 30 % of the total number of Priority I ships calling at its ports and anchorages.
2.   A Member State, in which the total number of calls of Priority I and Priority II ships is less than the inspection share referred to in Article 5(2)(b), shall be regarded as complying with such commitment, if that Member State carries out the inspections of Priority I ships required under Article 5(2)(a) and inspections on at least 85 % of the total number of Priority II ships calling at its ports and anchorages.
3.   The Commission shall, in its review referred to in Article 35, examine in particular the impact of this Article on the inspection commitment, taking into account the expertise and the experience gained in the Community and under the Paris MOU. The review shall take into account the objective of inspecting all ships calling at ports and anchorages within the Community. If appropriate, the Commission shall propose complementary measures with a view to improving the effectiveness of the inspection system applied in the Community, and, if necessary, a new review of the impact of this Article at a later stage.
