1.   Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that their pilots engaged on the berthing or unberthing of ships or engaged on ships bound for a port or in transit within a Member State immediately inform the competent authority of the port State or the coastal State, as appropriate, whenever they learn in the course of their normal duties that there are apparent anomalies which may prejudice the safe navigation of the ship, or which may pose a threat of harm to the marine environment.
2.   If port authorities or bodies, in the course of their normal duties, learn that a ship within their port has apparent anomalies which may prejudice the safety of the ship or poses an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment, such authority or body shall immediately inform the competent authority of the port State concerned.

sailing information (last port of call, port of destination),
—
description of apparent anomalies found on board.
4.   Member States shall ensure that proper follow-up action is taken on apparent anomalies notified by pilots and port authorities or bodies and shall record the details of action taken.
5.   The Commission may, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 31(2), adopt measures for the implementation of this Article, including a harmonised electronic format and procedures for the reporting of apparent anomalies by pilots and port authorities or bodies and of follow-up action taken by Member States.
