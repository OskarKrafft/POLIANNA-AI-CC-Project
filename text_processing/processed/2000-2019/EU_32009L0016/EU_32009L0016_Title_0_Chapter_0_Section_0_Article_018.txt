Article 18
Complaints
All complaints shall be subject to a rapid initial assessment by the competent authority. This assessment shall make it possible to determine whether a complaint is justified.
Should that be the case, the competent authority shall take the necessary action on the complaint, in particular, ensuring that anyone directly concerned by that complaint can make their views known.
Where the competent authority deems the complaint to be manifestly unfounded, it shall inform the complainant of its decision and of the reasons therefor.
The identity of the complainant shall not be revealed to the master or the shipowner of the ship concerned. The inspector shall ensure confidentiality during any interviews of crew members.
Member States shall inform the flag State administration, with a copy to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) if appropriate, of complaints not manifestly unfounded and of follow-up actions taken.
