Article 16
Access refusal measures concerning certain ships
1.   A Member State shall ensure that any ship which:
—
flies the flag of a State whose detention rate falls into the black list, adopted in accordance with the Paris MOU on the basis of information recorded in the inspection database and as published annually by the Commission, and has been detained or has been issued with a prevention of operation order under Directive 1999/35/EC more than twice in the course of the preceding 36 months in a port or anchorage of a Member State or of a State signatory of the Paris MOU, or
—
flies the flag of a State whose detention rate falls into the grey list, adopted in accordance with the Paris MOU on basis of information recorded in the inspection database and as published annually by the Commission, and has been detained or has been issued with a prevention of operation order under Directive 1999/35/EC more than twice in the course of the preceding 24 months in a port or anchorage of a Member State or of a State signatory of the Paris MOU,
is refused access to its ports and anchorages, except in the situations described in Article 21(6).
Refusal of access shall become applicable as soon as the ship leaves the port or anchorage where it has been the subject of a third detention and where a refusal of access order has been issued.
2.   The refusal of access order shall be lifted only after a period of three months has passed from the date of issue of the order and when the conditions in paragraphs 3 to 9 of Annex VIII are met.
If the ship is subject to a second refusal of access, the period shall be 12 months.
3.   Any subsequent detention in a port or anchorage within the Community shall result in the ship being refused access to any port and anchorage within the Community. This third refusal of access order may be lifted after a period of 24 months has passed from the issue of the order and only if:
—
the ship flies the flag of a State whose detention rate falls neither into the black list nor the grey list referred to in paragraph 1,
—
the statutory and classification certificates of the ship are issued by an organisation or organisations recognised under Regulation (EC) No 391/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations (recast) (12),
—
the ship is managed by a company with a high performance according to Annex I, Part I.1, and
—
the conditions in paragraphs 3 to 9 of Annex VIII are met.
Any ship not meeting the criteria specified in this paragraph, after a period of 24 months has passed from the issue of the order, shall be permanently refused access to any port and anchorage within the Community.
4.   Any subsequent detention in a port or anchorage within the Community after the third refusal of access shall result in the ship being permanently refused access to any port and anchorage within the Community.
5.   For the purpose of this Article, Member States shall comply with the procedures laid down in Annex VIII.
