Article 11
Frequency of inspections
Ships calling at ports or anchorages within the Community shall be subject to periodic inspections or to additional inspections as follows:
(a)
Ships shall be subject to periodic inspections at predetermined intervals depending on their risk profile in accordance with Annex I, Part I. The interval between periodic inspections of ships shall increase as the risk decreases. For high risk ships, this interval shall not exceed six months.
(b)
Ships shall be subject to additional inspections regardless of the period since their last periodic inspection as follows:
—
the competent authority shall ensure that ships to which overriding factors listed in Annex I, Part II 2A, apply are inspected,
—
ships to which unexpected factors listed in Annex I, Part II 2B, apply may be inspected. The decision to undertake such an additional inspection is left to the professional judgement of the competent authority.
