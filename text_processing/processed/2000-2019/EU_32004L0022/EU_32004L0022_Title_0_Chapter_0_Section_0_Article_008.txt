Article 8
Placing on the market and putting into use
1. Member States shall not impede for reasons covered by this Directive the placing on the market and/or putting into use of any measuring instrument that carries the "CE" marking and supplementary metrology marking in accordance with Article 7.
2. Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that measuring instruments be placed on the market and/or put into use only if they satisfy the requirements of this Directive.
3. A Member State may require a measuring instrument to satisfy provisions governing its putting into use that are justified by local climatic conditions. In such a case, the Member State shall choose appropriate upper and lower temperature limits from Table 1 of Annex I and, in addition, may specify humidity conditions (condensing or non-condensing) and whether the intended location of use is open or closed.
4. When different accuracy classes are defined for a measuring instrument:
(a) the instrument-specific annexes under the heading "Putting into use" may indicate the accuracy classes to be used for specific applications.
(b) in all other cases a Member State may determine the accuracy classes to be used for specific applications within the classes defined, subject to allowing the use of all accuracy classes on its territory.
In either case falling under (a) or (b), measuring instruments of a better accuracy class may be used if the owner so chooses.
5. At trade fairs, exhibitions, demonstrations, etc., Member States shall not prevent the showing of instruments not in conformity with this Directive, provided that a visible sign clearly indicates their non-conformity and their non-availability for placing on the market and/or putting into use until brought into conformity.
