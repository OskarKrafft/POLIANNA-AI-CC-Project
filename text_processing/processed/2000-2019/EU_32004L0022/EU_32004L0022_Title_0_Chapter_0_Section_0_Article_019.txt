Article 19
Safeguard clause
1. Where a Member State establishes that all or part of the measuring instruments of a particular model that bear the "CE" marking and the supplementary metrology marking do not satisfy the essential requirements relating to metrological performance set out in this Directive, when correctly installed and used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, it shall take all appropriate measures to withdraw these instruments from the market, prohibit or restrict their further being placed on the market, or prohibit or restrict their further being used.
When deciding on the above measures, the Member State shall take account of the systematic or incidental nature of the non-compliance. Where the Member State has established that the non-compliance is of a systematic nature, it shall immediately inform the Commission of the measures taken, indicating the reasons for its decision.
2. The Commission shall enter into consultation with the parties concerned as soon as possible.
(a) Should the Commission find that the measures taken by the Member State concerned are justified, it shall immediately inform that Member State thereof, as well as the other Member States.
The competent Member State shall take appropriate action against any person who affixed the markings and shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof.
If the non-compliance is attributed to shortcomings in the standards or normative documents, the Commission shall, after consulting the parties concerned, bring the matter as soon as possible before the appropriate Committee referred to in Articles 14 or 15.
(b) Should the Commission find that the measures taken by the Member State concerned are not justified, it shall immediately inform that Member State thereof, as well as the manufacturer concerned or his authorised representative.
The Commission shall ensure that the Member States are kept informed of the progress and outcome of the procedure.
