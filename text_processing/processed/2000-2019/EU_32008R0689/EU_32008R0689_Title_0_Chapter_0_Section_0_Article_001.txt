Article 1
Objectives
1.   The objectives of this Regulation are the following:
(a)
to implement the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, hereinafter ‘the Convention’;
(b)
to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international movement of hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm;
(c)
to contribute to the environmentally sound use of hazardous chemicals.
The objectives referred to in the first subparagraph shall be achieved by facilitating the exchange of information concerning the characteristics of such chemicals, by providing for a decision-making process within the Community on their import and export and by disseminating decisions to Parties and other countries as appropriate.
2.   In addition to the objectives referred to in paragraph 1, this Regulation shall ensure that the provisions of Council Directive 67/548/EEC (9) and of Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) regarding the classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals dangerous to man or to the environment when they are placed on the market in the Community also apply to all such chemicals when they are exported from the Member States to other Parties or other countries, unless those provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those Parties or other countries.
