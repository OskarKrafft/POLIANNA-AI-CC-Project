Article 29
Penalties
1.   Member States shall lay down rules on penalties, including, where necessary, fines and non-criminal predetermined or periodic penalties, applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive or of any binding decision adopted by the Commission, the national regulatory or other competent authority pursuant to this Directive, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Within the limits of national law, national regulatory and other competent authorities shall have the power to impose such penalties. The penalties provided for shall be appropriate, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
2.   Member States shall provide for penalties in the context of the procedure referred to in Article 22(3) only where an undertaking or public authority knowingly or grossly negligently provides misleading, erroneous or incomplete information.
When determining the amount of fines or periodic penalties imposed on an undertaking or public authority for knowingly or grossly negligently providing misleading, erroneous or incomplete information in the context of the procedure referred to in Article 22(3), regard shall be had, inter alia, to whether the behaviour of the undertaking or public authority has had a negative impact on competition and, in particular, whether, contrary to the information originally provided or any update thereof, the undertaking or public authority either has deployed, extended or upgraded a network, or has not deployed a network and has failed to provide an objective justification for that change of plan.
