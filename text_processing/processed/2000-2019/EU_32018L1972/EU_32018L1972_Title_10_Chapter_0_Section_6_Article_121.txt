Article 122
Review procedures
1.   By 21 December 2025 and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall review the functioning of this Directive and report to the European Parliament and to the Council.
Those reviews shall evaluate in particular the market implications of Article 61(3) and Articles 76, 78 and 79 and whether the ex ante and other intervention powers pursuant to this Directive are sufficient to enable national regulatory authorities to address uncompetitive oligopolistic market structures, and to ensure that competition in electronic communications markets continues to thrive to the benefit of end-users.
To that end, the Commission may request information from the Member States, which shall be supplied without undue delay.
2.   By 21 December 2025, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall review the scope of universal service, in particular with a view to proposing to the European Parliament and to the Council that the scope be changed or redefined.
That review shall be undertaken in light of social, economic and technological developments, taking into account, inter alia, mobility and data rates in light of the prevailing technologies used by the majority of end-users. The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding the outcome of the review.
3.   BEREC shall, by 21 December 2021 and every three years thereafter, publish an opinion on the national implementation and functioning of the general authorisation, and on their impact on the functioning of the internal market.
The Commission may, taking utmost account of the BEREC opinion, publish a report on the application of Chapter II of Title II of Part I and of Annex I, and may submit a legislative proposal to amend those provisions where it considers this to be necessary for the purpose of addressing obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market.
