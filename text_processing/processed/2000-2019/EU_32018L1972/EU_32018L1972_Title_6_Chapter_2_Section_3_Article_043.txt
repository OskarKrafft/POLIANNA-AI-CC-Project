Article 44
Co-location and sharing of network elements and associated facilities for providers of electronic communications networks
1.   Where an operator has exercised the right under national law to install facilities on, over or under public or private property, or has taken advantage of a procedure for the expropriation or use of property, competent authorities may impose co-location and sharing of the network elements and associated facilities installed on that basis, in order to protect the environment, public health, public security or to meet town- and country-planning objectives.
Co-location or sharing of network elements and facilities installed and sharing of property may be imposed only after an appropriate period of public consultation, during which all interested parties shall be given an opportunity to express their views and only in the specific areas where such sharing is considered to be necessary with a view to pursuing the objectives provided in the first subparagraph. Competent authorities may impose the sharing of such facilities or property, including land, buildings, entries to buildings, building wiring, masts, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions, ducts, conduits, manholes, cabinets or measures facilitating the coordination of public works. Where necessary, a Member State may designate a national regulatory or other competent authority for one or more of the following tasks:
(a)
coordinating the process provided for in this Article;
(b)
acting as a single information point;
(c)
setting down rules for apportioning the costs of facility or property sharing and of civil works coordination.
2.   Measures taken by a competent authority in accordance with this Article shall be objective, transparent, non-discriminatory, and proportionate. Where relevant, these measures shall be carried out in coordination with the national regulatory authorities.
