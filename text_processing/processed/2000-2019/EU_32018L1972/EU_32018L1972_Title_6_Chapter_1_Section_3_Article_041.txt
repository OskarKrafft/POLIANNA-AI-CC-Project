Article 42
Fees for rights of use for radio spectrum and rights to install facilities
1.   Member States may allow the competent authority to impose fees for the rights of use for radio spectrum or rights to install facilities on, over or under public or private property that are used for the provision of electronic communications networks or services and associated facilities which ensure the optimal use of those resources. Member States shall ensure that such fees are objectively justified, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate in relation to their intended purpose and shall take into account the general objectives of this Directive.
2.   With respect to rights of use for radio spectrum, Member States shall seek to ensure that applicable fees are set at a level which ensures efficient assignment and use of radio spectrum, including by:
(a)
setting reserve prices as minimum fees for rights of use for radio spectrum by having regard to the value of those rights in their possible alternative uses;
(b)
taking into account costs entailed by conditions attached to those rights; and
(c)
applying, to the extent possible, payment arrangements linked to the actual availability for use of the radio spectrum.
