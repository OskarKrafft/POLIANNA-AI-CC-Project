Article 123
Specific review procedure on end-user rights
1.   BEREC shall monitor the market and technological developments regarding the different types of electronic communications services and shall, by 21 December 2021 and every three years thereafter, or upon a reasoned request from at least two of its Member State members, publish an opinion on such developments and on their impact on the application of Title III of Part III.
In that opinion, BEREC shall assess to what extent Title III of Part III meets the objectives set out in Article 3. The opinion shall in particular take into account the scope of Title III of Part III as regards the types of electronic communications services covered. As a basis for the opinion, BEREC shall in particular analyse:
(a)
to what extent end-users of all electronic communications services are able to make free and informed choices, including on the basis of complete contractual information, and are able to switch easily their provider of electronic communications services;
(b)
to what extent any lack of abilities referred to in point (a) has resulted in market distortions or end-user harm;
(c)
to what extent effective access to emergency services is appreciably threatened, in particular due to an increased use of number-independent interpersonal communications services, by a lack of interoperability or technological developments;
(d)
the likely cost of any potential readjustments of obligations in Title III of Part III or impact on innovation for providers of electronic communications services.
2.   The Commission, taking utmost account of the BEREC opinion, shall publish a report on the application of Title III of Part III and shall submit a legislative proposal to amend that Title where it considers this to be necessary to ensure that the objectives set out in Article 3 continue to be met.
