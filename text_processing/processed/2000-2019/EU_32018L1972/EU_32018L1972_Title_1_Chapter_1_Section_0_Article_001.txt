Article 1
Subject matter, scope and aims
1.   This Directive establishes a harmonised framework for the regulation of electronic communications networks, electronic communications services, associated facilities and associated services, and certain aspects of terminal equipment. It lays down tasks of national regulatory authorities and, where applicable, of other competent authorities, and establishes a set of procedures to ensure the harmonised application of the regulatory framework throughout the Union.
2.   The aims of this Directive are to:
(a)
implement an internal market in electronic communications networks and services that results in the deployment and take-up of very high capacity networks, sustainable competition, interoperability of electronic communications services, accessibility, security of networks and services and end-user benefits; and
(b)
ensure the provision throughout the Union of good quality, affordable, publicly available services through effective competition and choice, to deal with circumstances in which the needs of end-users, including those with disabilities in order to access the services on an equal basis with others, are not satisfactorily met by the market and to lay down the necessary end-user rights.
3.   This Directive is without prejudice to:
(a)
obligations imposed by national law in accordance with Union law or by Union law in respect of services provided using electronic communications networks and services;
(b)
measures taken at Union or national level, in accordance with Union law, to pursue general interest objectives, in particular relating to the protection of personal data and privacy, content regulation and audiovisual policy;
(c)
actions taken by Member States for public order and public security purposes and for defence;
(d)
Regulations (EU) No 531/2012 and (EU) 2015/2120 and Directive 2014/53/EU.
4.   The Commission, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (‘BEREC’) and the authorities concerned shall ensure compliance of their processing of personal data with Union data protection rules.
