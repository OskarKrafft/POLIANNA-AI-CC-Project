Article 37
Joint authorisation process to grant individual rights of use for radio spectrum
Two or several Member States may cooperate with each other and with the RSPG, taking into account any interest expressed by market participants, by jointly establishing the common aspects of an authorisation process and, where appropriate, also jointly conducting the selection process to grant individual rights of use for radio spectrum.
When designing the joint authorisation process, Members States may take into consideration the following criteria:
(a)
the individual national authorisation processes shall be initiated and implemented by the competent authorities in accordance with a jointly agreed schedule;
(b)
it shall provide, where appropriate, for common conditions and procedures for the selection and granting of individual rights of use for radio spectrum among the Member States concerned;
(c)
it shall provide, where appropriate, for common or comparable conditions to be attached to the individual rights of use for radio spectrum among the Member States concerned, inter alia allowing users to be assigned similar radio spectrum blocks;
(d)
it shall be open at any time to other Member States until the joint authorisation process has been conducted.
Where, in spite of the interest expressed by market participants, Member States do not act jointly, they shall inform those market participants of the reasons explaining their decision.
