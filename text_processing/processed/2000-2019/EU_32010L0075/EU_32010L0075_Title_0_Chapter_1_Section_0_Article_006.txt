General binding rules
Without prejudice to the obligation to hold a permit, Member States may include requirements for certain categories of installations, combustion plants, waste incineration plants or waste co-incineration plants in general binding rules.
Where general binding rules are adopted, the permit may simply include a reference to such rules.
