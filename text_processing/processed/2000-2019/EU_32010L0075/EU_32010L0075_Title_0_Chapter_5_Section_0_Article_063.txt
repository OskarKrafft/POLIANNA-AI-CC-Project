Article 63
Substantial change to existing installations
1.   A change of the maximum mass input of organic solvents by an existing installation averaged over 1 day, where the installation is operated at its design output under conditions other than start-up and shut-down operations and maintenance of equipment, shall be considered as substantial if it leads to an increase of emissions of volatile organic compounds of more than:
(a)
25 % for an installation carrying out either activities which fall within the lower threshold band of items 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16 or 17 of the table in Part 2 of Annex VII or, activities which fall under one of the other items of Part 2 of Annex VII, and with a solvent consumption of less than 10 tonnes per year;
(b)
10 % for all other installations.
2.   Where an existing installation undergoes a substantial change, or falls within the scope of this Directive for the first time following a substantial change, that part of the installation which undergoes the substantial change shall be treated either as a new installation or as an existing installation, provided that the total emissions of the whole installation do not exceed those that would have resulted had the substantially changed part been treated as a new installation.
3.   In case of a substantial change, the competent authority shall check compliance of the installation with the requirements of this Directive.
