Article 4
Obligation to hold a permit
1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that no installation or combustion plant, waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant is operated without a permit.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, Member States may set a procedure for the registration of installations covered only by Chapter V.
The procedure for registration shall be specified in a binding act and include at least a notification to the competent authority by the operator of the intention to operate an installation.
2.   Member States may opt to provide that a permit cover two or more installations or parts of installations operated by the same operator on the same site.
Where a permit covers two or more installations, it shall contain conditions to ensure that each installation complies with the requirements of this Directive.
3.   Member States may opt to provide that a permit cover several parts of an installation operated by different operators. In such cases, the permit shall specify the responsibilities of each operator.
