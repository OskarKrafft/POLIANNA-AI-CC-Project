Article 5
Coherence and complementarity of Union action
1.   The actions of the European Solidarity Corps shall be consistent with and complementary to the relevant Union level policies, programmes, instruments as well as existing Union level networks pertinent to the activities of the European Solidarity Corps.
2.   The actions of the European Solidarity Corps shall also be consistent with, and complementary to, the relevant national-level policies, programmes and instruments in the participating countries. To that end, the Commission, national authorities and national agencies shall exchange information on existing national schemes and priorities related to solidarity and youth, on the one hand, and actions under the European Solidarity Corps on the other hand, with a view to build on relevant good practices and achieve efficiency and effectiveness.
3.   Other Union programmes may also contribute to the objectives of the European Solidarity Corps by supporting activities within its scope. This contribution shall be financed in accordance with their respective basic acts.
