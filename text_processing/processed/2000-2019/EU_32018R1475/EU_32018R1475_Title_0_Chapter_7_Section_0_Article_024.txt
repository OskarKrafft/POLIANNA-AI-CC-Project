Implementation of the European Solidarity Corps
1.   In order to implement this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt work programmes, taking into account the priorities under the national solidarity policies, where such information is transmitted to the Commission, by way of implementing acts. Each work programme shall ensure that the general objective and the specific objectives set out in Articles 3 and 4 are implemented in a consistent manner and shall outline the expected results, the method of implementation and its total amount.
