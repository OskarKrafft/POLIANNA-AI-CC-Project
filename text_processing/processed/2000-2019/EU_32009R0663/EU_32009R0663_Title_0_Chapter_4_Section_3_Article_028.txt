Article 28
Information to the European Parliament and to the Council
The Commission shall monitor the implementation of this Regulation. It shall, each year, on presentation of the preliminary draft budget, present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the EEPR.
If the report identifies serious risks in implementing the priority projects, the Commission shall recommend measures to offset those risks, and shall, where appropriate and consistent with the Recovery Plan, make additional proposals for such projects.
