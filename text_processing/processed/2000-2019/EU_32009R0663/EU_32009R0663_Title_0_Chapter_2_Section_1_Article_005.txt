Article 5
Priorities
The EEPR shall serve urgently to adapt and develop energy networks of particular importance to the Community in support of the operation of the internal energy market and, in particular, to increase interconnection capacity, security and diversification of supply and to overcome environmental, technical and financial obstacles. Special Community support is necessary to develop energy networks more intensively and to accelerate their construction, notably where the diversity of routes and sources of supply is low.
