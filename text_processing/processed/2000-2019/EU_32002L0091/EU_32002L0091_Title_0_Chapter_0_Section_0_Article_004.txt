Article 4
Setting of energy performance requirements
1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that minimum energy performance requirements for buildings are set, based on the methodology referred to in Article 3. When setting requirements, Member States may differentiate between new and existing buildings and different categories of buildings. These requirements shall take account of general indoor climate conditions, in order to avoid possible negative effects such as inadequate ventilation, as well as local conditions and the designated function and the age of the building. These requirements shall be reviewed at regular intervals which should not be longer than five years and, if necessary, updated in order to reflect technical progress in the building sector.
2. The energy performance requirements shall be applied in accordance with Articles 5 and 6.
3. Member States may decide not to set or apply the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 for the following categories of buildings:
- buildings and monuments officially protected as part of a designated environment or because of their special architectural or historic merit, where compliance with the requirements would unacceptably alter their character or appearance,
- buildings used as places of worship and for religious activities,
- temporary buildings with a planned time of use of two years or less, industrial sites, workshops and non-residential agricultural buildings with low energy demand and non-residential agricultural buildings which are in use by a sector covered by a national sectoral agreement on energy performance,
- residential buildings which are intended to be used less than four months of the year,
- stand-alone buildings with a total useful floor area of less than 50 m2.
