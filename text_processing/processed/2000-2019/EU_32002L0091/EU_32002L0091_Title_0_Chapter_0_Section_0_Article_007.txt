Article 7
Energy performance certificate
1. Member States shall ensure that, when buildings are constructed, sold or rented out, an energy performance certificate is made available to the owner or by the owner to the prospective buyer or tenant, as the case might be. The validity of the certificate shall not exceed 10 years.
Certification for apartments or units designed for separate use in blocks may be based:
- on a common certification of the whole building for blocks with a common heating system, or
- on the assessment of another representative apartment in the same block.
Member States may exclude the categories referred to in Article 4(3) from the application of this paragraph.
2. The energy performance certificate for buildings shall include reference values such as current legal standards and benchmarks in order to make it possible for consumers to compare and assess the energy performance of the building. The certificate shall be accompanied by recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of the energy performance.
The objective of the certificates shall be limited to the provision of information and any effects of these certificates in terms of legal proceedings or otherwise shall be decided in accordance with national rules.
3. Member States shall take measures to ensure that for buildings with a total useful floor area over 1000 m2 occupied by public authorities and by institutions providing public services to a large number of persons and therefore frequently visited by these persons an energy certificate, not older than 10 years, is placed in a prominent place clearly visible to the public.
The range of recommended and current indoor temperatures and, when appropriate, other relevant climatic factors may also be clearly displayed.
