Article 32
Compliant transportable pressure equipment which presents a risk to health and safety
1.   Where having performed an evaluation pursuant to Article 30(1) a Member State finds that although transportable pressure equipment is in compliance with Directive 2008/68/EC and this Directive, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the transportable pressure equipment concerned, when placed on the market, no longer presents that risk, to withdraw the equipment from the market or to recall it within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, as it may prescribe.
2.   The economic operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in respect of all the transportable pressure equipment concerned that he has made available on the market or is using throughout the Union.
3.   The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the transportable pressure equipment concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the equipment, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.
4.   The Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the measure is justified or not, and where necessary, propose appropriate measures.
5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator or operators.
