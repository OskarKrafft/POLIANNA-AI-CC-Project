Article 24
Changes to notifications
1.   Where a notifying authority has ascertained or has been informed that a notified body no longer meets the requirements set out in Article 20, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the notifying authority shall restrict, suspend or withdraw notification, as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.
2.   In the event of withdrawal, restriction or suspension of notification or where the notified body has ceased its activity, the notifying Member State shall take the appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that body are either processed by another notified body or kept available for the responsible notifying and market surveillance authorities on request.
