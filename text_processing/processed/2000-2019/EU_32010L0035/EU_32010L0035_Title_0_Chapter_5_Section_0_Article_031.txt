Article 31
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 30(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to a legally binding Union act, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure is justified or not.
The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator or operators.
2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant transportable pressure equipment is withdrawn from their markets, and shall inform the Commission accordingly.
If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw it.
3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the transportable pressure equipment is attributed to shortcomings in the standards as referred to in Article 30(5)(b), the Commission shall inform the relevant European standardisation body or bodies and may bring the matter before the Committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC (12). That Committee may consult the relevant European standardisation body or bodies before delivering its opinion.
