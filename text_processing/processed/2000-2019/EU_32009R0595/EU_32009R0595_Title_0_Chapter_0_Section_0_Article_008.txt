Timetable for application of type-approval of vehicles and engines
1.   With effect from 31 December 2012, national authorities shall refuse, on grounds relating to emissions, to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval in respect of new types of vehicles or engines which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.
Type-approval technical certificates corresponding to the emission stages prior to Euro VI may be granted to vehicles and engines intended for export to third countries, provided such certificates clearly state that the vehicles and engines in question cannot be placed on the Community market.
2.   With effect from 31 December 2013, national authorities shall, in the case of new vehicles which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures, consider certificates of conformity to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 26 of Directive 2007/46/EC and shall, on grounds relating to emissions, prohibit the registration, sale and entry into service of such vehicles.
With effect from the same date and except in the case of replacement engines for in-service vehicles, national authorities shall prohibit the sale or use of new engines which do not comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.
3.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and subject to entry into force of the implementing measures referred to in Article 4(3), Article 5(4) and in the first subparagraph of Article 6(2), if a manufacturer so requests, national authorities may not, on grounds relating to emissions of vehicles, refuse to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval for a new type of vehicle or engine, or prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of a new vehicle and the sale or use of new engines, where the vehicle or engines concerned comply with this Regulation and its implementing measures.
