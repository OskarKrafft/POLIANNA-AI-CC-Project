Permit-granting procedure
1.   Member States shall ensure that all relevant information concerning the conditions and procedures applicable for granting permits for civil works needed with a view to deploying elements of high-speed electronic communications networks, including any information concerning exemptions applicable to such elements as regards some or all permits required under national law, is available via the single information point.
2.   Member States may provide for the right of every undertaking providing or authorised to provide public communications networks to submit, by electronic means via the single information point, applications for permits required for civil works which are needed with a view to deploying elements of high-speed electronic communications networks.
3.   Member States shall take the necessary measures, in order to ensure that the competent authorities grant or refuse permits within four months from the date of the receipt of a complete permit request, without prejudice to other specific deadlines or obligations laid down for the proper conduct of the procedure which are applicable to the permit granting procedure in accordance with national or Union law or of appeal proceedings. Member States may provide that, exceptionally, in duly justified cases, that deadline may be extended. Any extension shall be the shortest possible in order to grant or refuse the permit. Any refusal shall be duly justified on the basis of objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria.
