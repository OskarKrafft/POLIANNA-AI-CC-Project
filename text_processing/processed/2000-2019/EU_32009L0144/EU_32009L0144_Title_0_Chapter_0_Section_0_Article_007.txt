Article 7
1.   If the Member State which has granted EC component type-approval finds that a number of windscreens and other glass panes or mechanical couplings bearing the same EC component type-approval mark do not conform to the type which it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models conform to the approved type.
The competent authorities of that Member State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken, which may if necessary extend, where there is a serious and repeated failure to conform, to withdrawal of the EC component type-approval.
Those authorities shall take the same measures if they are informed by the competent authorities of another Member State of such failure to conform.
2.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EC component type-approval and of the reasons for such a measure.
