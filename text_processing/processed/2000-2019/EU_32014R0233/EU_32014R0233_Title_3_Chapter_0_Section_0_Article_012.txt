Article 12
Programming for countries and regions in crisis, post-crisis or situations of fragility
1.   When drawing up the programming documents for countries and regions in crisis, post-crisis or situations of fragility or prone to natural disasters, due account shall be taken of the vulnerability, special needs and circumstances of the countries or regions concerned.
Proper attention should be given to conflict prevention, State and peace building, post-conflict reconciliation and reconstruction measures, as well as to the role of women and the rights of children in those processes.
Where partner countries or regions are directly involved in, or affected by, a crisis, post-crisis or situation of fragility, special emphasis shall be placed on stepping up coordination between relief, rehabilitation and development amongst all relevant actors to help the transition from an emergency situation to the development phase.
Programming documents for countries and regions in a situation of fragility or prone to natural disasters shall provide for disaster preparedness and prevention and for managing the consequences of such disasters and shall address vulnerability to shocks and strengthen resilience.
2.   On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, such as crises or immediate threats to democracy, the rule of law, human rights or fundamental freedoms, the Commission may adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 in order to modify strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes referred to in Article 11 of this Regulation.
Such reviews may entail a specific and adapted strategy to ensure the transition to long-term cooperation and development, promoting a better coordination and transition between the humanitarian and development policy instruments.
