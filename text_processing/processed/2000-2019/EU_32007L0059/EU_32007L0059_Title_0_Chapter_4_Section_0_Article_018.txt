Article 18
Monitoring of drivers by railway undertakings and infrastructure managers
1.   Railway undertakings and infrastructure managers shall be required to ensure, and to check, that the licences and certificates of the drivers they employ or contract are valid.
They shall set up a system for monitoring their drivers. If the results of such monitoring call into question a driver’s competence for the job and the continuing validity of his licence or certificate, railway undertakings and infrastructure managers shall immediately take the necessary action.
2.   If a driver considers that his state of health calls into question his fitness for the job, he shall immediately inform the railway undertaking or infrastructure manager, whichever is appropriate.
As soon as a railway undertaking or infrastructure manager is aware or is informed by a medical doctor that the health of a driver has deteriorated to a point where his fitness for the job is called into question, it shall immediately take the necessary action, including the examination described in section 3.1 of Annex II and, if necessary, the withdrawal of the certificate and the updating of the register provided for in Article 22(2). Furthermore, it shall ensure that at no time during their service drivers are under the influence of any substance which is likely to affect their concentration, attention or behaviour. The competent authority shall be informed without delay of any cases of work incapacity of more than three months.
