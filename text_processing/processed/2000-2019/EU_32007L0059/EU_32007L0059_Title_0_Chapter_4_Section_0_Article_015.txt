ArticleÂ 15
Obtaining a certificate
Each railway undertaking and infrastructure manager shall set up its own procedures for issuing and updating certificates in accordance with this Directive, as part of its safety management system, as well as appeals procedures allowing drivers to request a review of a decision relating to the issue, updating, suspension or withdrawal of a certificate.
In the event of disagreement, the parties may appeal to the competent authority or any independent appeal body.
Railway undertakings and infrastructure managers shall update, without delay, a certificate whenever the certificate holder has obtained additional authorisations relating to rolling stock or infrastructure.
