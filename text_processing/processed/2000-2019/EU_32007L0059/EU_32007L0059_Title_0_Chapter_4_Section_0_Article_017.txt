Article 17
Cessation of employment
When a driver ceases to work for a railway undertaking or an infrastructure manager, it shall inform the competent authority without delay.
The licence shall remain valid, provided that the conditions in Article 16(1) remain fulfilled.
A certificate shall become invalid when its holder ceases to be employed as a driver. However, the holder shall receive a certified copy of it and of all documents providing evidence of his training, qualifications, experience and professional competences. When issuing a certificate to a driver, a railway undertaking or infrastructure manager shall take account of all those documents.
