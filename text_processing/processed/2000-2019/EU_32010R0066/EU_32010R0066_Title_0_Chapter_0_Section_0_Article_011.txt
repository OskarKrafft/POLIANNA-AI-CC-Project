Article 11
Ecolabelling schemes in the Member States
1.   Where EU Ecolabel criteria for a given product group have been published, other nationally or regionally officially recognised EN ISO 14024 type I ecolabelling schemes which do not cover that product group at the time of publication may be extended to that product group only where the criteria developed under those schemes are at least as strict as the EU Ecolabel criteria.
2.   In order to harmonise the criteria of European ecolabelling schemes (EN ISO 14024 type I), EU Ecolabel criteria shall also take into account existing criteria developed in officially recognised ecolabelling schemes in the Member States.
