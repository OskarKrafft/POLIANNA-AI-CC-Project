Article 15
Derogations from the system of certification of entities in charge of maintenance
1.   Member States may fulfil the obligation to identify the entity in charge of maintenance through alternative measures with respect to the maintenance system established in Article 14, in the following cases:
(a)
vehicles registered in a third country and maintained in accordance with the law of that country;
(b)
vehicles used on networks or lines the track gauge of which is different from that of the main rail network within the Union and in respect of which fulfilment of the requirements laid down in Article 14(2) is ensured by international agreements with third countries;
(c)
freight wagons and passenger coaches which are in shared use with third countries the track gauge of which is different from that of the main rail network within the Union;
(d)
vehicles used on the networks referred to in Article 2(3), and military equipment and special transport requiring an ad hoc national safety authority permit to be delivered prior to their entry into service. In this case derogations shall be granted for periods not longer than 5 years.
2.   The alternative measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be implemented through derogations to be granted by the relevant national safety authority or by the Agency when:
(a)
registering vehicles pursuant to Article 47 of Directive (EU) 2016/797, as far as the identification of the entity in charge of maintenance is concerned;
(b)
delivering single safety certificates and safety authorisations to railway undertakings and infrastructure managers pursuant to Articles 10 and 12 of this Directive, as far as the identification or certification of the entity in charge of maintenance is concerned.
3.   Derogations shall be identified and justified in the annual report referred to in Article 19. Where it appears that undue safety risks are being taken on the Union rail system, the Agency shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. The Commission shall make contact with the parties concerned and, where appropriate, request the Member State concerned to withdraw its derogation decision.
