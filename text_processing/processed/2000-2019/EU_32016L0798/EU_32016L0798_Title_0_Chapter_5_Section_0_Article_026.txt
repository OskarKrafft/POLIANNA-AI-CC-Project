Article 26
Safety recommendations
1.   A safety recommendation issued by an investigating body shall in no case create a presumption of blame or liability for an accident or incident.
2.   Recommendations shall be addressed to the national safety authority and, where needed by reason of the character of the recommendation, to the Agency, to other bodies or authorities in the Member State concerned or to other Member States. Member States, their national safety authorities and the Agency shall, within the limits of their competence, take the necessary measures to ensure that the safety recommendations issued by the investigating bodies are duly taken into consideration, and, where appropriate, acted upon.
3.   The Agency, the national safety authority and other authorities or bodies or, where appropriate, other Member States to which recommendations have been addressed, shall report back periodically to the investigating body on measures that are taken or planned as a consequence of a given recommendation.
