Article 23
Assistance on board
Without prejudice to the access rules as referred to in Article 19(1), railway undertakings shall provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility assistance free of charge on board a train and during boarding and disembarking from a train.
For the purposes of this Article, assistance on board shall consist of all reasonable efforts to offer assistance to a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility in order to allow that person to have access to the same services in the train as other passengers, should the extent of the person’s disability or reduced mobility not allow him or her to have access to those services independently and in safety.
