Article 22
Assistance at railway stations
1.   On departure from, transit through or arrival at, a staffed railway station of a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, the station manager shall provide assistance free of charge in such a way that that person is able to board the departing service, or to disembark from the arriving service for which he or she purchased a ticket, without prejudice to the access rules referred to in Article 19(1).
2.   Member States may provide for a derogation from paragraph 1 in the case of persons travelling on services which are the subject of a public service contract awarded in conformity with Community law, on condition that the competent authority has put in place alternative facilities or arrangements guaranteeing an equivalent or higher level of accessibility of transport services.
3.   In unstaffed stations, railway undertakings and station managers shall ensure that easily accessible information is displayed in accordance with the access rules referred to in Article 19(1) regarding the nearest staffed stations and directly available assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
