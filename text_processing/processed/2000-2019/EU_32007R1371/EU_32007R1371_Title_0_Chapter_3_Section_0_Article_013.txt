Article 13
Advance payments
1.   If a passenger is killed or injured, the railway undertaking as referred to in Article 26(5) of Annex I shall without delay, and in any event not later than fifteen days after the establishment of the identity of the natural person entitled to compensation, make such advance payments as may be required to meet immediate economic needs on a basis proportional to the damage suffered.
2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, an advance payment shall not be less than EUR 21 000 per passenger in the event of death.
3.   An advance payment shall not constitute recognition of liability and may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of this Regulation but is not returnable, except in the cases where damage was caused by the negligence or fault of the passenger or where the person who received the advance payment was not the person entitled to compensation.
