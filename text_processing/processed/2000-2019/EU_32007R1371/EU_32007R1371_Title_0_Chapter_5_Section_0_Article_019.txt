Article 19
Right to transport
1.   Railway undertakings and station managers shall, with the active involvement of representative organisations of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, establish, or shall have in place, non-discriminatory access rules for the transport of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
2.   Reservations and tickets shall be offered to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility at no additional cost. A railway undertaking, ticket vendor or tour operator may not refuse to accept a reservation from, or issue a ticket to, a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility, or require that such person be accompanied by another person, unless this is strictly necessary in order to comply with the access rules referred to in paragraph 1.
