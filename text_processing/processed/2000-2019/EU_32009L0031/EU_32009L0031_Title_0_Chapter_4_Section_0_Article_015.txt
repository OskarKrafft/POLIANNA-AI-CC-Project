Article 15
Inspections
1.   Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities organise a system of routine and non-routine inspections of all storage complexes within the scope of this Directive for the purposes of checking and promoting compliance with the requirements of the Directive and of monitoring the effects on the environment and on human health.
2.   Inspections should include activities such as visits of the surface installations, including the injection facilities, assessing the injection and monitoring operations carried out by the operator, and checking all relevant records kept by the operator.
3.   Routine inspections shall be carried out at least once a year until three years after closure and every five years until transfer of responsibility to the competent authority has occurred. They shall examine the relevant injection and monitoring facilities as well as the full range of relevant effects from the storage complex on the environment and on human health.
4.   Non-routine inspections shall be carried out:
(a)
if the competent authority has been notified or made aware of leakages or significant irregularities pursuant to Article 16(1);
(b)
if the reports pursuant to Article 14 have shown insufficient compliance with the permit conditions;
(c)
to investigate serious complaints related to the environment or human health;
(d)
in other situations where the competent authority considers this appropriate.
5.   Following each inspection, the competent authority shall prepare a report on the results of the inspection. The report shall evaluate compliance with the requirements of this Directive and indicate whether or not further action is necessary. The report shall be communicated to the operator concerned and shall be publicly available in accordance with relevant Community legislation within two months of the inspection.
