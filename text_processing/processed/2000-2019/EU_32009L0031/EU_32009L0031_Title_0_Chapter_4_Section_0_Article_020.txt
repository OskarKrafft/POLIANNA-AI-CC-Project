Article 20
Financial mechanism
1.   Member States shall ensure that the operator, on the basis of arrangements to be decided by the Member States, makes a financial contribution available to the competent authority before the transfer of responsibility pursuant to Article 18 has taken place. The contribution from the operator shall take into account those criteria referred to in Annex I and elements relating to the history of storing CO2 relevant to determining the post-transfer obligations, and cover at least the anticipated cost of monitoring for a period of 30 years. This financial contribution may be used to cover the costs borne by the competent authority after the transfer of responsibility to ensure that the CO2 is completely and permanently contained in geological storage sites after the transfer of responsibility.
2.   The Commission may adopt guidelines for the estimation of the costs referred to in paragraph 1 to be developed in consultation with Member States with a view to ensuring transparency and predictability for operators.
