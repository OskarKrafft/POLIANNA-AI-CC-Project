Article 16
Measures in case of leakages or significant irregularities
1.   Member States shall ensure that in the event of leakages or significant irregularities, the operator immediately notifies the competent authority, and takes the necessary corrective measures, including measures related to the protection of human health. In cases of leakages and significant irregularities which imply the risk of leakage, the operator shall also notify the competent authority pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC.

3.   The competent authority may at any time require the operator to take the necessary corrective measures, as well as measures related to the protection of human health. These may be additional to or different from those laid out in the corrective measures plan. The competent authority may also at any time take corrective measures itself.
4.   If the operator fails to take the necessary corrective measures, the competent authority shall take the necessary corrective measures itself.
5.   The competent authority shall recover the costs incurred in relation to the measures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 from the operator, including by drawing on the financial security pursuant to Article 19.
