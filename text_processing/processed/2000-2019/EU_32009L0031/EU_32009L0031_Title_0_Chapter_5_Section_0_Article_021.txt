Article 21
Access to transport network and storage sites
1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that potential users are able to obtain access to transport networks and to storage sites for the purposes of geological storage of the produced and captured CO2, in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.
2.   The access referred to in paragraph 1 shall be provided in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner determined by the Member State. The Member State shall apply the objectives of fair and open access, taking into account:
(a)
the storage capacity which is or can reasonably be made available within the areas determined under Article 4, and the transport capacity which is or can reasonably be made available;
(b)
the proportion of its CO2 reduction obligations pursuant to international legal instruments and to Community legislation that it intends to meet through capture and geological storage of CO2;
(c)
the need to refuse access where there is an incompatibility of technical specifications which cannot be reasonably overcome;
(d)
the need to respect the duly substantiated reasonable needs of the owner or operator of the storage site or of the transport network and the interests of all other users of the storage or the network or relevant processing or handling facilities who may be affected.
3.   Transport network operators and operators of storage sites may refuse access on the grounds of lack of capacity. Duly substantiated reasons shall be given for any refusal.
4.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the operator refusing access on the grounds of lack of capacity or a lack of connection makes any necessary enhancements as far as it is economic to do so or when a potential customer is willing to pay for them, provided this would not negatively impact on the environmental security of transport and geological storage of CO2.
