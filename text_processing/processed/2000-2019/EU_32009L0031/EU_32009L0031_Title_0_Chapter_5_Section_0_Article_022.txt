Article 22
Dispute settlement
1.   Member States shall ensure that they have in place dispute settlement arrangements, including an authority independent of the parties with access to all relevant information, to enable disputes relating to access to transport networks and to storage sites to be settled expeditiously, taking into account the criteria referred to in Article 21(2) and the number of parties which may be involved in negotiating such access.
2.   In the event of cross-border disputes, the dispute settlement arrangements of the Member State having jurisdiction over the transport network or the storage site to which access has been refused shall be applied. Where, in cross-border disputes, more than one Member State covers the transport network or storage site concerned, the Member States concerned shall consult with a view to ensuring that this Directive is applied consistently.
