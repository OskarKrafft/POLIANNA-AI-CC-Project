Article 7
Land-sea interactions
1.   In order to take into account land-sea interactions in accordance with Article 4(2), should this not form part of the maritime spatial planning process as such, Member States may use other formal or informal processes, such as integrated coastal management. The outcome shall be reflected by Member States in their maritime spatial plans.
2.   Without prejudice to Article 2(3), Member States shall aim through maritime spatial planning to promote coherence of the resulting maritime spatial plan or plans with other relevant processes.
