Article 16
Free movement of subsystems
Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 15(1), Member States may not, in their territory and on grounds relating to this Directive, prohibit, restrict or hinder the construction, placing in service and operation of structural subsystems constituting the rail system which meet the essential requirements. In particular, they may not require checks which have already been carried out:
—
either as part of the procedure leading to the ‘EC’ declaration of verification, the components of which are set out in Annex V,
—
or in other Member States, before or after the entry into force of this Directive, with a view to verifying compliance with identical requirements under identical operational conditions.
