Article 10
Placing on the market of interoperability constituents
1.   Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that interoperability constituents:
(a)
are placed on the market only if they enable interoperability to be achieved within the rail system while at the same time meeting the essential requirements;
(b)
are used in their area of use as intended and are suitably installed and maintained.
These provisions shall not obstruct the placing on the market of these constituents for other applications.
2.   Member States may not, in their territory and on the basis of this Directive, prohibit, restrict or hinder the placing on the market of interoperability constituents for use in the rail system where they comply with this Directive. In particular, they may not require checks which have already been carried out as part of the procedure of ‘EC’ declaration of conformity or suitability for use, the components of which are set out in Annex IV.
