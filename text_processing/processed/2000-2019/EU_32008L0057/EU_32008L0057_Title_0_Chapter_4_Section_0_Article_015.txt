Article 15
Procedure for placing in service
1.   Without prejudice to Chapter V, each Member State shall authorise the placing in service of those structural subsystems constituting the rail system which are located or operated in its territory.
To this end, Member States shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that these subsystems may be placed in service only if they are designed, constructed and installed in such a way as to meet the essential requirements concerning them when integrated into the rail system. In particular, they shall check:
—
the technical compatibility of these subsystems with the system into which they are being integrated,
—
the safe integration of these subsystems in accordance with Articles 4(3) and 6(3) of Directive 2004/49/EC.
2.   Each Member State shall check, before these subsystems are placed in service, that they comply, where applicable, with the relevant TSI provisions on operation and maintenance.
3.   After these subsystems have been placed in service, the check shall be carried out:
(a)
for infrastructures, in the context of the granting and supervision of safety authorisations under Article 11 of Directive 2004/49/EC;
(b)
for vehicles, in the context of the granting and supervision of safety certificates under Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC.
To that end, the assessment and verification procedures laid down in the relevant structural and functional TSIs shall be used.
