development on the basis of a draft prepared by the Agency of a model of the Community rail system, based on the list of subsystems (Annex II), to guarantee consistency between TSIs; this model must include in particular the various constituents of the system and their interfaces and act as a reference framework for defining the areas of use of each TSI;
(b)
development of a model structure for developing TSIs;
(c)
development of a method of cost-benefit analysis of the solutions set out in the TSIs;
(d)
adoption of the mandates needed to draw up the TSIs;
