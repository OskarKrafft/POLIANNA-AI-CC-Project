Article 7
Deficiencies in TSIs
1.   If, after its adoption, it appears that a TSI does not fully meet the essential requirements, the committee referred to in Article 29 may be consulted at the request of a Member State or upon the initiative of the Commission.
The Commission may request a technical opinion from the Agency. The Commission, with the involvement of the committee, shall analyse the technical opinion.
2.   If the TSI needs to be amended because of a minor error and this does not justify an immediate revision, the Commission may recommend that the technical opinion is used pending the review of the TSI in accordance with Article 6(1). In that case, the Agency shall publish the technical opinion.
3.   If the TSI needs to be amended because of an important or critical error, the revision procedure referred to in Article 6(1) shall be applied forthwith.
