Article 15
Safeguard clause
1. Where a Member State has justifiable grounds for believing that a specific EC fertiliser, although satisfying the requirements of this Regulation, constitutes a risk to safety or health of humans, animals or plants or a risk to the environment, it may temporarily prohibit the placing on the market of that fertiliser in its territory or make it subject to special conditions. It shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof, giving the reasons for its decision.
2. The Commission shall adopt a decision on the matter within 90 days from the receipt of the information in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 32(2).
3. The provisions of this Regulation shall not preclude the taking of measures by the Commission or by a Member State which are justified on grounds of public security to prohibit, restrict or hinder the placing on the market of EC fertilisers.
