Article 27
Test of resistance to detonation
Without prejudice to the measures referred to in Article 26, the manufacturer shall ensure that each type of EC high nitrogen content ammonium nitrate fertiliser placed on the market has passed the test of resistance to detonation described in sections 2, 3 (method 1, point 3) and 4 of Annex III of this Regulation. This test shall be carried out by one of the approved laboratories referred to in Article 30(1) or 33(1). Manufacturers shall submit the results of the test to the competent authority of the Member State concerned at least 5 days before placing the fertiliser on the market, or at least 5 days before the arrival of the fertiliser at the borders of the European Community in the case of imports. Thereafter, the manufacturer shall continue to guarantee that all supplies of the fertiliser placed on the market are capable of passing the abovementioned test.
