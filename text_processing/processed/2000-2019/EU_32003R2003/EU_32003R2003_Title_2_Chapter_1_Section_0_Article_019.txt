Identification
1. In addition to the compulsory identification markings referred to in Article 9(1)(a), the markings set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Article shall be stated.
2. The following shall be stated after the type designation of compound fertilisers:
(i) The chemical symbols of the declared secondary nutrients, between brackets and after the symbols of the primary nutrients.
(ii) Numbers indicating the primary nutrient content. The declared secondary nutrient content shall be indicated between brackets after the primary nutrient content.
3. The fertiliser type designation shall only be followed by figures indicating primary and secondary nutrient content.
4. Where micro-nutrients are declared, the words "with micro-nutrients" or the word "with" followed by the name or names and chemical symbols of the micro-nutrients present shall be given.
5. The declared content of primary nutrients and secondary nutrients shall be given as a percentage by mass, as whole numbers or, where necessary, where an appropriate method of analysis exists, to one decimal place.
In fertilisers containing more than one declared nutrient, the order shall be for primary nutrients: N, P2O5 and/or P, K2O and/or K, and for secondary nutrients: CaO and/or Ca, MgO and/or Mg, Na2O and/or Na, SO3 and/or S.
The declared content of micro-nutrients shall give the name and symbol of each micro-nutrient, indicating the percentage by mass as specified in sections E.2.2 and E.2.3 of Annex I and according to solubility.
6. The forms and solubility of the nutrients shall also be expressed as a percentage by mass of fertiliser, except where Annex I explicitly provides that this content shall be otherwise expressed.
The number of decimal places shall be one, except for micro-nutrients where it shall be as specified in sections E.2.2 and E.2.3 of Annex I.
