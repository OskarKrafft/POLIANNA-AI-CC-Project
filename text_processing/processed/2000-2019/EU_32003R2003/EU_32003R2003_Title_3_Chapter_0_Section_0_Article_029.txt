Article 29
Control measures
1. Member States may subject fertilisers marked "EC fertiliser" to official control measures for the purpose of verifying that they comply with this Regulation.
Member States may charge fees not exceeding the cost of tests needed for such control measures, but this shall not oblige manufacturers to repeat tests or to pay for repeated tests where the first test was made by a laboratory which fulfilled the conditions of Article 30 and where the test showed compliance of the fertiliser in question.
2. Member States shall ensure that sampling and analysis for official controls of EC fertilisers belonging to types of fertilisers listed in Annex I are carried out in accordance with the methods described in Annex III and IV.
3. Compliance with this Regulation in respect of conformity to types of fertiliser and compliance with the declared nutrient content and/or the declared content expressed as forms and solubilities of such nutrients may be verified at official inspections only by means of sampling and analysis methods established in accordance with Annex III and IV and taking into account the tolerances specified in Annex II.
4. The adaptation and modernisation of measuring, sampling and analysis methods shall follow the procedure referred to in Article 32(2), and shall, wherever possible, use European Standards. The same procedure shall apply to the adoption of implementing rules needed to specify the control measures provided for in this Article and in Articles 8, 26 and 27 of this Regulation. Such rules shall in particular address the question of the frequency with which tests need to be repeated, as well as measures that are designed to ensure that the fertiliser put on the market is identical with the fertiliser tested.
