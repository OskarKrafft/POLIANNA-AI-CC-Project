‘emergency stop signal’ means a light-signalling function to indicate to other road users to the rear of the vehicle that a high retardation force is being applied to the vehicle relative to the prevailing road conditions;
(8)
‘reversing detection’ means a system to make the driver aware of people and objects at the rear of the vehicle with the primary aim of avoiding collisions when reversing;
(9)
‘lane departure warning system’ means a system to warn the driver that the vehicle is drifting out of its travel lane;
(10)
‘advanced emergency braking system’ means a system which can automatically detect a potential collision and activate the vehicle braking system to decelerate the vehicle with the purpose of avoiding or mitigating a collision;
(11)
‘emergency lane-keeping system’ means a system that assists the driver in keeping a safe position of the vehicle with respect to the lane or road boundary, at least when a lane departure occurs or is about to occur and a collision might be imminent;
(12)
‘vehicle master control switch’ means the device by which the vehicle’s on-board electronics system is brought, from being switched off, as in the case where a vehicle is parked without the driver being present, to normal operation mode;
(13)
‘event data recorder’ means a system with the only purpose of recording and storing critical crash-related parameters and information shortly before, during and immediately after a collision;
(14)
‘frontal protection system’ means a separate structure or structures, such as a bull bar, or a supplementary bumper which, in addition to the original‐equipment bumper, is intended to protect the external surface of the vehicle from damage in the event of a collision with an object, with the exception of structures having a mass of less than 0,5 kg, intended to protect only the vehicle’s lights;
(15)
‘bumper’ means any front, lower, outer structures of a vehicle, including attachments thereto, which are intended to give protection to a vehicle when involved in a low speed frontal collision with another vehicle; it does not include however any frontal protection system;
(16)
‘hydrogen-powered vehicle’ means any motor vehicle that uses hydrogen as fuel to propel the vehicle;
(17)
‘hydrogen system’ means an assembly of hydrogen components and connecting parts fitted on a hydrogen-powered vehicle, excluding the hydrogen-powered propulsion system or the auxiliary power unit;
(18)

(19)
‘hydrogen component’ means hydrogen containers and all other parts of hydrogen‐powered vehicles that are in direct contact with hydrogen or which form part of a hydrogen system;
(20)
‘hydrogen container’ means the component within the hydrogen system that stores the primary volume of hydrogen fuel;
(21)
‘automated vehicle’ means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required;
(22)
‘fully automated vehicle’ means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;
(23)
‘driver availability monitoring system’ means a system to assess whether the driver is in a position to take over the driving function from an automated vehicle in particular situations, where appropriate;
(24)
‘vehicle platooning’ means the linking of two or more vehicles in a convoy using connectivity technology and automated driving support systems which allow the vehicles to maintain automatically a set, close distance between each other when connected for certain parts of a journey and to adapt to changes in the movement of the lead vehicle with little to no action from the drivers;
(25)
‘maximum mass’ means the technically permissible maximum laden mass stated by the manufacturer;
(26)
‘A-pillar’ means the foremost and outermost roof support extending from the chassis to the roof of the vehicle.
