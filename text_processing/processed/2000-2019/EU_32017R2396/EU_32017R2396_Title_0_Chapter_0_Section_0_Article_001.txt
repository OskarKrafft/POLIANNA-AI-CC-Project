To better address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations, and to facilitate, in particular, the use of investment platforms for small-scale projects, thereby ensuring complementarity and thus avoiding crowding out participants in the same market, EIB special activities supported by the EFSI shall, as a preferred way and if duly justified:

projects that carry a risk corresponding to EIB special activities, as defined in Article 16 of the EIB Statute, especially if such projects present country-, sector- or region-specific risks, in particular those experienced in less developed regions and transition regions and/or if such projects present risks associated with innovation, in particular in growth-, sustainability- and productivity-enhancing unproven technologies,
