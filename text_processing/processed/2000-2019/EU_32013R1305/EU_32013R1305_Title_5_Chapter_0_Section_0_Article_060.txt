Article 60
Eligibility of expenditure
1.   By way of derogation from Article 65(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, in cases of emergency measures due to natural disasters, the rural development programmes may provide that eligibility of expenditure relating to programme changes may start from the date when the natural disaster occurred.
2.   Expenditure shall be eligible for an EAFRD contribution only where incurred for operations decided upon by the Managing Authority of the programme in question or under its responsibility, in accordance with selection criteria referred to in Article 49.
With the exception of general costs as defined in Article 45(2)(c), in respect of investment operations under measures falling within the scope of Article 42 TFEU, only expenditure which has been incurred after an application has been submitted to the competent authority shall be considered eligible.
Member States may provide in their programmes that only expenditure which has been incurred after the application for support has been approved by the competent authority shall be eligible.
3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to Article 51(1) and (2).
4.   Payments by beneficiaries shall be supported by invoices and documents proving payment. Where this cannot be done, payments shall be supported by documents of equivalent probative value, except for forms of support under points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 67(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
