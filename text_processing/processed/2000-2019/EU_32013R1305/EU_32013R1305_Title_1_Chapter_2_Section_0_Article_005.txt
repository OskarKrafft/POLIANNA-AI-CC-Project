Article 5
Union priorities for rural development
The achievement of the objectives of rural development, which contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, shall be pursued through the following six Union priorities for rural development, which reflect the relevant Thematic Objectives of the CSF:
(1)
fostering knowledge transfer and innovation in agriculture, forestry, and rural areas with a focus on the following areas:
(a)
fostering innovation, cooperation, and the development of the knowledge base in rural areas;
(b)
strengthening the links between agriculture, food production and forestry and research and innovation, including for the purpose of improved environmental management and performance;
(c)
fostering lifelong learning and vocational training in the agricultural and forestry sectors.
(2)
enhancing farm viability and competitiveness of all types of agriculture in all regions and promoting innovative farm technologies and the sustainable management of forests, with a focus on the following areas:
(a)
improving the economic performance of all farms and facilitating farm restructuring and modernisation, notably with a view to increasing market participation and orientation as well as agricultural diversification;
(b)
facilitating the entry of adequately skilled farmers into the agricultural sector and, in particular, generational renewal.
(3)
promoting food chain organisation, including processing and marketing of agricultural products, animal welfare and risk management in agriculture, with a focus on the following areas:
(a)
improving competitiveness of primary producers by better integrating them into the agri-food chain through quality schemes, adding value to agricultural products, promotion in local markets and short supply circuits, producer groups and organisations and inter-branch organisations;
(b)
supporting farm risk prevention and management.
(4)
restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to agriculture and forestry, with a focus on the following areas:
(a)
restoring, preserving and enhancing biodiversity, including in Natura 2000 areas, and in areas facing natural or other specific constraints, and high nature value farming, as well as the state of European landscapes;
(b)
improving water management, including fertiliser and pesticide management;
(c)
preventing soil erosion and improving soil management.
(5)
promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift towards a low carbon and climate resilient economy in agriculture, food and forestry sectors, with a focus on the following areas:
(a)
increasing efficiency in water use by agriculture;
(b)
increasing efficiency in energy use in agriculture and food processing;
(c)
facilitating the supply and use of renewable sources of energy, of by-products, wastes and residues and of other non food raw material, for the purposes of the bio-economy;
(d)
reducing green house gas and ammonia emissions from agriculture;
(e)
fostering carbon conservation and sequestration in agriculture and forestry;
(6)
promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas, with a focus on the following areas:
(a)
facilitating diversification, creation and development of small enterprises, as well as job creation;
(b)
fostering local development in rural areas;
(c)
enhancing the accessibility, use and quality of information and communication technologies (ICT) in rural areas.
All those priorities shall contribute to the cross-cutting objectives of innovation, environment and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Programmes may address fewer than six priorities if justified on the basis of the analysis of the situation in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats ("the SWOT") and the ex ante evaluation. At least four priorities shall be addressed by each programme. When a Member State submits a national programme and a set of regional programmes, the national programme may address fewer than four priorities.
Other focus areas may be included in programmes in order to pursue one of the priorities if justified and measurable.
