Article 62
Verifiability and controllability of measures
1.   Member States shall ensure that all the rural development measures that they intend to implement are verifiable and controllable. To this end, the Managing Authority and the paying agency of each rural development programme shall provide an ex ante assessment of the verifiability and controllability of the measures to be included in the rural development programme. The Managing Authority and paying agency shall also undertake the assessment of the verifiability and controllability of measures during the implementation of the rural development programme. Ex ante assessment and assessment during the implementation period shall take into account the results of controls in the previous and current programming period. Where the assessment reveals that the requirements of verifiability and controllability are not met, the measures concerned shall be adjusted accordingly.
2.   Where aid is granted on the basis of standard costs or additional costs and income foregone, Member States shall ensure that the relevant calculations are adequate and accurate and established in advance on the basis of a fair, equitable and verifiable calculation. To this end, a body that is functionally independent from the authorities responsible for the programme implementation and possesses the appropriate expertise shall perform the calculations or confirm the adequacy and accuracy of the calculations. A statement confirming the adequacy and accuracy of the calculations shall be included in the rural development programme.
