Article 63
Advances
1.   Payment of advances shall be subject to the establishment of a bank guarantee or an equivalent guarantee corresponding to 100 % of the amount of the advance. As regards public beneficiaries, advances shall be paid to municipalities, regional authorities and associations thereof, as well as to public law bodies.
A facility provided as a guarantee by a public authority shall be considered equivalent to the guarantee referred to in the first subparagraph, provided that the authority undertakes to pay the amount covered by that guarantee if entitlement to the advance paid is not established.
2.   The guarantee may be released when the competent paying agency establishes that the amount of actual expenditure corresponding to the public contribution related to the operation exceeds the amount of the advance.
