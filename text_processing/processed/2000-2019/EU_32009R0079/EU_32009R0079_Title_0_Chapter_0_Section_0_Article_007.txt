Article 7
Requirements for hydrogen components, other than containers, designed to use liquid hydrogen
1.   Hydrogen components, other than containers, designed to use liquid hydrogen shall be tested in accordance with the test procedures set out in Annex III with regard to their type.
2.   Pressure relief devices shall be designed so as to ensure that the pressure in the inner tank or in any other hydrogen component does not exceed a permissible value. The values shall be set in proportion to the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) of the hydrogen system. A safety system for heat exchangers shall be provided for the detection of their failure.
