Article 5
Applicability to sub-assemblies
Where instrument-specific annexes lay down the essential requirements for sub-assemblies, this Directive shall apply mutatis mutandis to such sub-assemblies.
Sub-assemblies and measuring instruments may be assessed independently and separately for the purpose of establishing conformity.
