4.   The CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking may be affixed to the instrument during the fabrication process, if justified.
5.   The supplementary metrology marking shall immediately follow the CE marking.
The CE marking and the supplementary metrology marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body, where that body is involved in the production control phase as set out in Annex II.
The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or his authorised representative.
The identification number of the notified body concerned shall be indelible or self destructive upon removal.
6.   The CE marking, the supplementary metrology marking and, where applicable, the identification number of the notified body may be followed by any other mark indicating a special risk or use.
7.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.
