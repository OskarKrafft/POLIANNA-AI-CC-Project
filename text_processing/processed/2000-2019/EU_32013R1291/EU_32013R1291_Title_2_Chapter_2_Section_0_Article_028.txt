Article 28
Information, communication, exploitation and dissemination
The Commission shall implement information and communication actions concerning Horizon 2020, including communication measures concerning supported projects and results. In particular, it shall provide timely and thorough information to Member States.
The part of the Horizon 2020 budget allocated to communication shall also cover the corporate communication of the Union's political priorities to the extent that they are related to the general objective of this Regulation.
Activities to disseminate information and carry out communication activities shall be an integral part of all actions supported by Horizon 2020. Information and communication concerning Horizon 2020, including on supported projects, shall be made available and accessible in digital form.
In addition, the following specific actions shall be supported:
(a)
initiatives aimed at widening awareness and facilitating access to funding under Horizon 2020, in particular for those regions or types of participants that have a relatively low participation;
(b)
targeted assistance to projects and consortia to provide them with adequate access to the necessary skills to optimise the communication, exploitation and dissemination of results;
(c)
actions which bring together and disseminate results from a range of projects, including those that may be funded from other sources, to provide user-friendly databases and reports that summarise key findings, and, where relevant, communication and dissemination to the scientific community, industry and the general public;
(d)
dissemination to policy makers, including standardisation bodies, to promote the use of policy-relevant results by the appropriate bodies at international, Union, national and regional level;
(e)
initiatives to foster dialogue and debate on scientific, technological and innovation related issues with the public through involvement of the research and innovation community and civil society organisations, and to take advantage of social media and other innovative technologies and methodologies, especially in order to help raise public awareness of the benefits of research and innovation in meeting societal challenges.
