Article 22
Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
1.   Particular attention shall be paid to ensuring the adequate participation of, and research and innovation impact on, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) throughout the implementation of Horizon 2020. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of SME participation shall be undertaken as part of the evaluation and monitoring arrangements.
2.   In addition to the establishment of better conditions for SMEs to participate in all relevant opportunities in Horizon 2020, specific actions shall be undertaken. In particular, a dedicated SME instrument that is targeted at all types of SMEs with an innovation potential, in a broad sense, shall be created under a single centralised management system and implemented primarily in a bottom-up manner through a continuously open call tailored to the needs of SMEs as set out under the specific objective "Innovation in SMEs" in Point 3.3.(a) of Part II of Annex I. That instrument shall take account of the specific objective "Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies" set out in Point 1 of Part II of Annex I and each of the specific objectives under the priority "Societal challenges" set out in Points 1 to 7 of Part III of Annex I and shall be implemented in a consistent manner.
3.   The integrated approach set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 and the simplification of procedures should lead to a minimum of 20 % of the total combined budget for the specific objective "Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies" and the priority "Societal challenges" going to SMEs.
4.   Particular attention shall be paid to the adequate representation of SMEs in public-private partnerships referred to in Article 25.
