Article 23
Collaborative projects and partnership programmes
Horizon 2020 should be implemented primarily through transnational collaborative projects, delivered through calls for proposals in the Horizon 2020 work programmes provided for in Decision 2013/743/EU. Those projects will be complemented by public-private and public-public partnerships. The partnerships will be designed with the involvement of Member States and shall develop principles for their internal management.
