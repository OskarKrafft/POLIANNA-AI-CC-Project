Article 8
Recovery
1.   Operators of stationary equipment or of refrigeration units of refrigerated trucks and trailers that contain fluorinated greenhouse gases not contained in foams shall ensure that the recovery of those gases is carried out by natural persons that hold the relevant certificates provided for by Article 10, so that those gases are recycled, reclaimed or destroyed.
This obligation applies to operators of any of the following equipment:
(a)
the cooling circuits of stationary refrigeration, stationary air-conditioning and stationary heat pump equipment;
(b)
the cooling circuits of refrigeration units of refrigerated trucks and trailers;
(c)
stationary equipment that contains fluorinated greenhouse gas-based solvents;
(d)
stationary fire protection equipment;
(e)
stationary electrical switchgear.
2.   The undertaking that uses a fluorinated greenhouse gas container immediately prior to its disposal shall arrange for the recovery of any residual gases to make sure they are recycled, reclaimed or destroyed.
3.   Operators of products and equipment not listed in paragraph 1, including mobile equipment, that contain fluorinated greenhouse gases shall arrange for the recovery of the gases, to the extent that it is technically feasible and does not entail disproportionate costs, by appropriately qualified natural persons, so that they are recycled, reclaimed or destroyed or shall arrange for their destruction without prior recovery.
The recovery of fluorinated greenhouse gases from air-conditioning equipment in road vehicles outside the scope of Directive 2006/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) shall be carried out by appropriately qualified natural persons.
For the recovery of fluorinated greenhouse gases from air-conditioning equipment in motor vehicles falling within the scope of Directive 2006/40/EC only natural persons holding at least a training attestation in accordance with Article 10(2) shall be considered appropriately qualified.
