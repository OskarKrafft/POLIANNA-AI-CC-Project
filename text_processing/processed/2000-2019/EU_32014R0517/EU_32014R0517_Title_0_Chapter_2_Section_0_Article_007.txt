Article 7
Emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases in relation to production
1.   Producers of fluorinated compounds shall take all necessary precautions to limit emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases to the greatest extent possible during:
(a)
production;
(b)
transport; and
(c)
storage.
This Article also applies where fluorinated greenhouse gases are produced as by-products.
2.   Without prejudice to Article 11(1), the placing on the market of fluorinated greenhouse gases and gases listed in Annex II shall be prohibited unless, where relevant, producers or importers provide evidence, at the time of such placing, that trifluoromethane, produced as a by-product during the manufacturing process, including during the manufacturing of feedstocks for their production, has been destroyed or recovered for subsequent use, in line with best available techniques.
This requirement shall apply from 11 June 2015.
