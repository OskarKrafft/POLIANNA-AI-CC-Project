Article 25
Penalties
1.   Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
Member States shall notify those provisions to the Commission by 1 January 2017 at the latest and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.
2.   In addition to the penalties referred to in paragraph 1, undertakings that have exceeded their quota for placing hydrofluorocarbons on the market, allocated in accordance with Article 16(5) or transferred to them in accordance with Article 18, may only be allocated a reduced quota allocation for the allocation period after the excess has been detected.
The amount of reduction shall be calculated as 200 % of the amount by which the quota was exceeded. If the amount of the reduction is higher than the amount to be allocated in accordance with Article 16(5) as a quota for the allocation period after the excess has been detected, no quota shall be allocated for that allocation period and the quota for the following allocation periods shall be reduced likewise until the full amount has been deducted.
