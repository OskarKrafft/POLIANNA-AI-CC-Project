Article 18
Transfer of quotas and authorisation to use quotas for the placing on the market of hydrofluorocarbons in imported equipment
1.   Any producer or importer for whom a reference value has been determined pursuant to Article 16(1) or (3) and who has been allocated a quota in accordance with Article 16(5), may transfer in the registry referred to in Article 17(1) that quota for all or any quantities to another producer or importer in the Union or to another producer or importer which is represented in the Union by an only representative referred to in the second and third subparagraph of Article 16(5).
2.   Any producer or importer having received its quota pursuant to Article 16(1) and (3) or to whom a quota has been transferred pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article may authorise another undertaking to use its quota for the purpose of Article 14.
Any producer or importer having received its quota exclusively on the basis of a declaration pursuant to Article 16(2), may only authorise another undertaking to use its quota for the purpose of Article 14 provided that the corresponding quantities of hydrofluorocarbons are physically supplied by the authorising producer or importer.
For the purpose of Articles 15, 16 and 19(1) and (6) the respective quantities of hydrofluorocarbons shall be deemed to be placed on the market by the authorising producer or importer at the moment of the authorisation. The Commission may require from the authorising producer or importer evidence that it is active in the supply of hydrofluorocarbons.
