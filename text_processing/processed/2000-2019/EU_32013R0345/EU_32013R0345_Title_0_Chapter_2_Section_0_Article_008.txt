Article 8
1.   Where a manager of a qualifying venture capital fund delegates functions to third parties, the manager’s liability towards the qualifying venture capital fund or the investors therein shall remain unaffected. The manager shall not delegate functions to the extent that, in essence, it can no longer be considered to be the manager of a qualifying venture capital fund and to the extent that it becomes a letter-box entity.
2.   Any delegation of functions under paragraph 1 shall not undermine the effectiveness of supervision of the manager of a qualifying venture capital fund, and, in particular, shall not prevent that manager from acting, or the qualifying venture capital fund from being managed, in the best interests of the investors therein.
