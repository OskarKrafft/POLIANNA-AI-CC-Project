Article 18
1.   The competent authority of the home Member State shall supervise compliance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
2.   Where there are clear and demonstrable grounds that lead the competent authority of the host Member State to believe that the manager of a qualifying venture capital fund is in breach of this Regulation within its territory, it shall promptly inform the competent authority of the home Member State accordingly. The competent authority of the home Member State shall take appropriate measures.
3.   If the manager of a qualifying venture capital fund persists in acting in a manner that is clearly in breach of this Regulation despite measures taken by the competent authority of the home Member State or because that competent authority has failed to take measures within reasonable time, the competent authority of the host Member State may, after informing the competent authority of the home Member State, take all the appropriate measures in order to protect investors, including prohibiting the manager of a qualifying venture capital fund from carrying out any further marketing of its qualifying venture capital funds within the territory of the host Member State.
