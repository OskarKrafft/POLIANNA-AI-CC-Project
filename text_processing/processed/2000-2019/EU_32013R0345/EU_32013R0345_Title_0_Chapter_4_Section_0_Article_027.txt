Article 27
1.   By 22 July 2017, the Commission shall start a review of the interaction between this Regulation and other rules on collective investment undertakings and their managers, in particular those laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU. That review shall address the scope of this Regulation. It shall gather data for assessing whether it is necessary to extend the scope to allow for managers of venture capital funds with assets under management that in total exceed the threshold provided for in Article 2(1) to become managers of qualifying venture capital funds in accordance with this Regulation.
2.   Following the review referred to in paragraph 1, and after consulting ESMA, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
