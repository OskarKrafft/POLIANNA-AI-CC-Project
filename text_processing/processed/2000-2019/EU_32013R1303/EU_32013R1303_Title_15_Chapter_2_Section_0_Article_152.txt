Article 152
Transitional provisions
1.   This Regulation shall not affect either the continuation or modification, including the total or partial cancellation of assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 or any other legislation applying to that assistance on 31 December 2013. That Regulation or such other applicable legislation shall consequently continue to apply after 31 December 2013 to that assistance or the operations concerned until their closure. For the purposes of this paragraph assistance shall cover operational programmes and major projects.
2.   Applications to receive assistance made or approved under Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall remain valid.
3.   Where a Member State makes use of the option set out in Article 123(3), it may submit a request to the Commission for the managing authority to carry out the functions of the certifying authority by way of derogation from point (b) of Article 59(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 for the corresponding operational programmes implemented on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. The request shall be accompanied by an assessment made by the audit authority. Where the Commission is satisfied on the basis of information made available from the audit authority and from its own audits that the management and control systems of those operational programmes function effectively and that their functioning will not be prejudiced by the managing authority carrying out the functions of the certifying authority, it shall inform the Member State of its agreement within two months of the date of receipt of the request.
