Article 92
Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and for the European territorial cooperation goal
1.   Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall amount to 96,33 % of the global resources (i.e., a total of EUR 313 197 435 409) and shall be allocated as follows:
(a)
52,45 % (i.e., a total of EUR 164 279 015 916) for less developed regions;
(b)
10,24 % (i.e., a total of EUR 32 084 931 311) for transition regions;
(c)
15,67 % (i.e., a total of EUR 49 084 308 755) for more developed regions;
(d)
21,19 % (i.e., a total of EUR 66 362 384 703) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund;
(e)
0,44 % (i.e., a total of EUR 1 386 794 724) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.
2.   In addition to the amounts set out in Article 91 and paragraph 1 of this Article, for the years 2014 and 2015, a further amount of EUR 94 200 000 and of EUR 92 400 000 respectively shall be made available as set out in the "Additional adjustments" under Annex VII. Those amounts shall be identified in the decision of the Commission referred to in Article 91(2).
3.   In 2016, the Commission shall, in its technical adjustment for the year 2017 in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013, review the total allocations under the Investment for growth and jobs goal of each Member State for 2017-2020, applying the allocation method set out in paragraphs 1 to 16 of Annex VII on the basis of the most recent statistics available and of the comparison, for the capped Member States, between the cumulated national GDP observed for the years 2014-2015 and the cumulated national GDP for the same period estimated in 2012 in accordance with paragraph 10 of Annex VII. Where there is a cumulative divergence of more than +/-5 % between the revised allocations and the total allocations, the total allocations shall be adjusted correspondingly. In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013, adjustments shall be spread in equal proportions over the years 2017-2020 and the corresponding ceilings of the financial framework shall be modified accordingly. The total net effect of the adjustments, whether positive or negative, shall not exceed EUR 4 000 000 000. Following the technical adjustment, the Commission, shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out a revised annual breakdown of the global resources for each Member State.
4.   In order to ensure that sufficient investment is targeted at youth employment, labour mobility, knowledge, social inclusion and combating poverty, the share of Structural Funds resources available for programming for operational programmes, under the Investment for growth and jobs goal allocated to the ESF in each Member State, shall not be lower than the corresponding ESF share for that Member State laid down in the operational programmes for the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives for the 2007-2013 programming period. To that share shall be added an additional amount for each Member State determined in accordance with the method set out in Annex IX in order to ensure that the share of the ESF as a percentage of total combined resources for the Funds at Union level, excluding the support from the Cohesion Fund for transport infrastructure under the CEF referred to in paragraph 6 and support from the Structural Funds for aid for the most deprived referred to in paragraph 7, in Member States is not less than 23,1 %. For the purposes of this paragraph, investment provided from the ESF to the YEI shall be considered to be part of the share of Structural Funds allocated to the ESF.
5.   Resources for the YEI shall amount to EUR 3 000 000 000 from the specific allocation for the YEI and at least EUR 3 000 000 000 from ESF targeted investment.
6.   The amount of support from the Cohesion Fund to be transferred to the CEF shall be EUR 10 000 000 000. It shall be spent for transport infrastructure projects in line with Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 exclusively in Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund.
The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, setting out the amount to be transferred from each Member State's Cohesion Fund allocation to the CEF, which amount shall be determined on a pro rata basis for the whole period. The Cohesion Fund allocation of each Member State shall be reduced accordingly.
The annual appropriations corresponding to the support from the Cohesion Fund referred to in the first subparagraph shall be entered in the relevant budget lines of the CEF as of the 2014 budgetary exercise.
The amount transferred from the Cohesion Fund to the CEF, referred to in the first subparagraph, shall be implemented by launching specific calls for projects implementing the core networks or for projects and horizontal activities identified in Part I of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.
Rules applicable for the transport sector under Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 shall apply to the specific calls referred to in the fourth subparagraph. Until 31 December 2016, the selection of projects eligible for financing shall respect the national allocations under the Cohesion Fund. As of 1 January 2017, resources transferred to the CEF which have not been committed to a transport infrastructure project shall be made available to all Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund to finance transport infrastructure projects in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.
In order to support Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund, which may experience difficulties in designing projects that are of a sufficient maturity, quality, or both, and which have sufficient added value for the Union, particular attention shall be given to programme support actions aimed at strengthening institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administrations and public services in relation to the development and implementation of projects listed in Part I of Annex I to the Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013. To ensure the highest possible absorption of the transferred funds in all Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion fund, the Commission may organise additional calls.
7.   The support from the Structural Funds for aid for the most deprived under the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal shall be not less than EUR 2 500 000 000 and may be increased by up to EUR 1 000 000 000 by additional support decided on a voluntary basis by Member States.
The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, setting out the amount to be transferred from each Member State's Structural Funds allocation to aid for the most deprived for the whole period. The Structural Funds allocation of each Member State shall be reduced accordingly, on the basis of a pro-rata reduction by category of region.
The annual appropriations corresponding to the support from the Structural Funds referred to in the first subparagraph shall be entered in the relevant budget lines of the aid for the most deprived instrument with the 2014 budgetary exercise.
8.   EUR 330 000 000 of the Structural Funds resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall be allocated to innovative actions under direct or indirect management by the Commission in the area of sustainable urban development.
9.   Resources for the European territorial cooperation goal shall amount to 2,75 % of the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the Funds for the period 2014-2020 (i.e., a total of EUR 8 948 259 330).
10.   For the purposes of this Article, Articles 18, 91, 93, 95, 99, 120, Annex I and Annex X of this Regulation, Article 4 of the ERDF Regulation, Article 4 and Articles 16 to 23 of the ESF Regulation, Article 3(3) of the ETC Regulation, the outermost region of Mayotte shall be considered to be a NUTS level 2 region falling into the category of less developed regions. For the purposes of Article 3(1) and (2) of the ETC Regulation, the regions of Mayotte and Saint Martin shall be considered to be NUTS level 3 regions.
