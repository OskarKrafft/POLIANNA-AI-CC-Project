Article 44
Re-use of resources attributable to the support from the ESI Funds until the end of the eligibility period
1.   Resources paid back to financial instruments from investments or from the release of resources committed for guarantee contracts, including capital repayments and gains and other earnings or yields, such as interest, guarantee fees, dividends, capital gains or any other income generated by investments, which are attributable to the support from the ESI Funds, shall be re-used for the following purposes, up to the amounts necessary and in the order agreed in the relevant funding agreements:
(a)
further investments through the same or other financial instruments, in accordance with the specific objectives set out under a priority;
(b)
where applicable, preferential remuneration of private investors, or public investors operating under the market economy principle, who provide counterpart resources to the support from the ESI Funds to the financial instrument or who co-invest at the level of final recipients;
(c)
where applicable, reimbursement of management costs incurred and payment of management fees of the financial instrument.
The need and the level for preferential remuneration pursuant to point (b) of the first subparagraph shall be established in the ex-ante assessment. The preferential remuneration shall not exceed what is necessary to create the incentives for attracting private counterpart resources and shall not over-compensate private investors, or public investors operating under the market economy principle. The alignment of interest shall be ensured through an appropriate sharing of risk and profit and shall be carried out on a normal commercial basis and be compatible with Union State aid rules.
2.   The managing authority shall ensure that adequate records of the use of the resources referred to in paragraph 1 are maintained.
