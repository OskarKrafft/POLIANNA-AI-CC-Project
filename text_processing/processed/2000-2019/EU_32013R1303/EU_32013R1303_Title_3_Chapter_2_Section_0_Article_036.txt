Article 36
Integrated territorial investment
1.   Where an urban development strategy or other territorial strategy, or a territorial pact referred to in Article 12(1) of the ESF Regulation, requires an integrated approach involving investments from the ESF, ERDF or Cohesion Fund under more than one priority axis of one or more operational programmes, actions may be carried out as an integrated territorial investment (an 'ITI').
Actions carried out as an ITI may be complemented with financial support from the EAFRD or the EMFF.
2.   Where an ITI is supported by ESF, ERDF or Cohesion Fund, the relevant operational programme or programmes shall describe the approach to the use of the ITI instrument and the indicative financial allocation from each priority axis in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.
Where an ITI is complemented with financial support from the EAFRD or the EMFF, the indicative financial allocation and the measures covered shall be set out in the relevant programme or programmes in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.
3.   The Member State or the managing authority may designate one or more intermediate bodies, including local authorities, regional development bodies or non-governmental organisations, to carry out the management and implementation of an ITI in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.
4.   The Member State or the relevant managing authorities shall ensure that the monitoring system for the programme or programmes provides for the identification of operations and outputs of a priority contributing to an ITI.
