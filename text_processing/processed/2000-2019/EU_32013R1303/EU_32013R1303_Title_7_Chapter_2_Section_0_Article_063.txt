Article 63
Beneficiary under PPP operations
1.   In relation to a PPP operation, and by way of derogation from point (10) of Article 2, a beneficiary may be either:
(a)
the public law body initiating the operation; or
(b)
a body governed by private law of a Member State (the "private partner") selected or to be selected for the implementation of the operation.
2.   The public law body initiating the PPP operation may propose that the private partner, to be selected after approval of the operation, be the beneficiary for the purposes of support from the ESI Funds. In that event, the approval decision shall be conditional on the managing authority satisfying itself that the selected private partner fulfils and assumes all the corresponding obligations of a beneficiary under this Regulation.
3.   The private partner selected to implement the operation may be replaced as beneficiary during implementation where this is required under the terms and conditions of the PPP or the financing agreement between the private partner and the financial institution co-financing the operation. In that event the replacement private partner or public law body shall become the beneficiary provided that the managing authority satisfies itself that the replacement partner fulfils and assumes all the corresponding obligations of a beneficiary under this Regulation.
4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down additional rules on the replacement of a beneficiary and on the related responsibilities.
5.   The replacement of a beneficiary shall not be considered a change in ownership within the meaning of point (b) of Article 71(1) if that replacement satisfies the applicable conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article and in a delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.
