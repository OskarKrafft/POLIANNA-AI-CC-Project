Common Strategic Framework
1.   In order to promote the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the Union, a Common Strategic Framework ('CSF') is hereby established, as set out in Annex I. The CSF establishes strategic guiding principles to facilitate the programming process and the sectoral and territorial coordination of Union intervention under the ESI Funds and with other relevant Union policies and instruments, in line with the targets and objectives of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, taking into account the key territorial challenges of the various types of territories.
2.   The strategic guiding principles as set out in the CSF shall be established in line with the purpose and within the scope of the support provided by each ESI Fund, and in line with the rules governing the operation of each ESI Fund, as defined in this Regulation and the Fund-specific rules. The CSF shall not impose additional obligations upon Member States beyond those set out within the framework of the relevant sectoral Union policies.
3.   The CSF shall facilitate the preparation of the Partnership Agreement and programmes in accordance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity and taking into account national and regional competences, in order for the specific and appropriate policy and coordination measures to be decided.
