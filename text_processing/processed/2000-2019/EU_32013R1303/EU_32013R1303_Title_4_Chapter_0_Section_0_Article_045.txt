Article 45
Use of resources after the end of the eligibility period
Member States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that resources paid back to financial instruments, including capital repayments and gains and other earnings or yields generated during a period of at least eight years after the end of the eligibility period, which are attributable to the support from the ESI Funds to financial instruments pursuant to Article 37, are used in accordance with the aims of the programme or programmes, either within the same financial instrument or, following the exit of those resources from the financial instrument, in other financial instruments provided that, in both cases, an assessment of market conditions demonstrates a continuing need for such investment, or in other forms of support.
