Article 142
Suspension of payments
1.   All or part of the interim payments at the level of priorities or operational programmes may be suspended by the Commission if one or more of the following conditions are met:
(a)
there is a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme, which has put at risk the Union contribution to the operational programme and for which corrective measures have not been taken;
(b)
expenditure in a statement of expenditure is linked to an irregularity having serious financial consequences which has not been corrected;
(c)
the Member State has failed to take the necessary action to remedy the situation giving rise to an interruption under Article 83;
(d)
there is a serious deficiency in the quality and reliability of the monitoring system or of the data on common and specific indicators;
(e)
there is a failure to complete actions to fulfil an ex ante conditionality subject to the conditions set out in Article 19;
(f)
there is evidence resulting from the performance review for a priority that there has been a serious failure in achieving that priority's milestones relating to financial and output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework subject to the conditions set out in Article 22.
The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for suspension of payments linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy, which shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance.
2.   The Commission may decide, by means of implementing acts, to suspend all or part of interim payments, after having given the Member State the opportunity to present its observations.
3.   The Commission shall end suspension of all or part of interim payments where the Member State has taken the necessary measures to enable the suspension to be lifted.
