Article 132
Payment to beneficiaries
1.   Subject to the availability of funding from initial and annual pre-financing and interim payments, the managing authority shall ensure that a beneficiary receives the total amount of eligible public expenditure due in full and no later than 90 days from the date of submission of the payment claim by the beneficiary.
No amount shall be deducted or withheld and no specific charge or other charge with equivalent effect shall be levied that would reduce amounts due to beneficiaries.
2.   The payment deadline referred to in paragraph 1 may be interrupted by the managing authority in either of the following duly justified cases:
(a)
the amount of the payment claim is not due or the appropriate supporting documents, including the documents necessary for management verifications under point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(4), have not been provided;
(b)
an investigation has been initiated in relation to a possible irregularity affecting the expenditure concerned.
The beneficiary concerned shall be informed in writing of the interruption and the reasons for it.
