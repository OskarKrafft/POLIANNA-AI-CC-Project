Article 24
Increase in payments for Member State with temporary budgetary difficulties
1.   On the request of a Member State, interim payments may be increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate applicable to each priority for the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund or to each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF. If a Member State meets one of the following conditions after 21 December 2013, the increased rate, which may not exceed 100 %, shall apply to its requests for payments for the period until 30 June 2016:
(a)
where the Member State concerned receives a loan from the Union under Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010;
(b)
where the Member State concerned receives medium-term financial assistance in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 conditional on the implementation of a macro-economic adjustment programme;
(c)
where financial assistance is made available to the Member State concerned conditional on the implementation of a macroeconomic adjustment programme as specified in Regulation (EU) No 472/2013.
This paragraph shall not apply to programmes under the ETC Regulation.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Union support through interim payments and payments of the final balance shall not be higher than the public support or the maximum amount of support from the ESI Funds for each priority for the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund, or for each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF, as laid down in the decision of the Commission approving the programme.
3.   The Commission shall examine the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 and shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report with its assessment and, if necessary, a legislative proposal before 30 June 2016.
