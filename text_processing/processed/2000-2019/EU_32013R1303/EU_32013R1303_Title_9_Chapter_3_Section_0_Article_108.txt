1.   The Member State or the managing authority shall set up a steering committee for the joint action plan, distinct from the monitoring committee of the relevant operational programmes. The steering committee shall meet at least twice a year and shall report to the managing authority. The managing authority shall inform the relevant monitoring committee of the results of the work carried out by the steering committee and the progress of the implementation of the joint action plan in accordance with point (e) of Article 110(1) and point (a) of Article 125(2).
The composition of the steering committee shall be decided by the Member State in agreement with the relevant managing authority, respecting the principle of partnership.
The Commission may participate in the work of the steering committee in an advisory capacity.
2.   The steering committee shall carry out the following activities:
(a)
review progress towards achieving the milestones, outputs and results of the joint action plan;
(b)
consider and approve any proposal to amend the joint action plan in order to take account of any issues affecting its performance.
3.   Requests for amendment of joint action plans submitted by a Member State to the Commission shall be duly substantiated. The Commission shall assess whether the request for amendment is justified, taking account of the information provided by the Member State. The Commission may make observations and the Member State shall provide to the Commission all necessary additional information. The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, on a request for amendment no later than three months after its submission by the Member State, provided that any observations made by the Commission have been satisfactorily taken into account. The amendment shall enter into force from the date of the decision, unless otherwise set out in the decision.
