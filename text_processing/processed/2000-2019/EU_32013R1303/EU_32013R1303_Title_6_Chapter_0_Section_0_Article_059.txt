Article 59
Technical assistance at the initiative of the Member States
1.   At the initiative of a Member State, the ESI Funds may support actions for preparation, management, monitoring, evaluation, information and communication, networking, complaint resolution, and control and audit. The ESI Funds may be used by the Member State to support actions for the reduction of the administrative burden on beneficiaries, including electronic data exchange systems, and actions to reinforce the capacity of Member State authorities and beneficiaries to administer and use those Funds. The ESI Funds may also be used to support actions to reinforce the capacity of relevant partners in line with point (e) of Article 5(3) and to support exchange of good practices between such partners. The actions referred to in this paragraph may concern previous and subsequent programming periods.
2.   The Fund-specific rules may add or exclude actions which may be financed by the technical assistance of each ESI Fund.
