Article 128
Cooperation with audit authorities
1.   The Commission shall cooperate with audit authorities to coordinate their audit plans and methods and shall immediately exchange with those authorities the results of audits carried out on management and control systems.
2.   To facilitate this cooperation in cases where a Member State designates more than one audit authority, the Member State may designate a coordination body.
3.   The Commission, the audit authorities and any coordination body shall meet on a regular basis and, as a general rule, at least once a year, unless otherwise agreed, to examine the annual control report, the audit opinion and the audit strategy, and to exchange views on issues relating to improvement of the management and control systems.
