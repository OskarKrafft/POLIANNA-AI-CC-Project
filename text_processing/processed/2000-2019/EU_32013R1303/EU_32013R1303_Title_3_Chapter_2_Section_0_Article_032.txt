Article 32
Community-led local development
1.   Community-led local development shall be supported by the EAFRD, which shall be designated as LEADER local development and may be supported by the ERDF, ESF or EMFF. For the purposes of this Chapter, those Funds are hereinafter referred to as the "ESI Funds concerned".
2.   Community-led local development shall be:
(a)
focused on specific subregional areas;
(b)
led by local action groups composed of representatives of public and private local socio-economic interests, in which, at the decision-making level neither public authorities, as defined in accordance with national rules, nor any single interest group represents more than 49 % of the voting rights;
(c)
carried out through integrated and multi-sectoral area-based local development strategies;
(d)
designed taking into consideration local needs and potential, and shall include innovative features in the local context, networking and, where appropriate, cooperation.
3.   Support from the ESI Funds concerned to community-led local development shall be consistent and coordinated between the ESI Funds concerned. This shall be ensured inter alia through coordinated capacity-building, selection, approval and funding of community-led local development strategies and local action groups.
4.   Where the selection committee for the community-led local development strategies set up under Article 33(3) determines that the implementation of the community-led local development strategy selected requires support from more than one Fund, it may designate in accordance with national rules and procedures, a lead Fund to support all running and animation costs under points (d) and (e) of Article 35(1) for the community-led local development strategy.
5.   Community-led local development supported by the ESI Funds concerned shall be carried out under one or more priorities of the relevant programme or programmes in accordance with Fund-specific rules of the ESI Funds concerned.
