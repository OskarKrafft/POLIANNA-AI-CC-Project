Article 5
Periodic checks and consumer information
1.   Member States shall ensure that the in-service petrol vapour capture efficiency of Stage II petrol vapour recovery systems is tested at least once each year either by checking that the vapour/petrol ratio under simulated petrol flow conditions is in conformity with Article 4(2) or by any other appropriate methodology.
2.   Where an automatic monitoring system has been installed, Member States shall ensure that the petrol vapour capture efficiency is tested at least once every three years. Any such automatic monitoring system shall automatically detect faults in the proper functioning of the Stage II petrol vapour recovery system and in the automatic monitoring system itself, indicate faults to the service station operator and automatically stop the flow of petrol from the faulty dispenser if the fault is not rectified within seven days.
3.   When a service station has installed a Stage II petrol vapour recovery system, Member States shall ensure that it displays a sign, sticker or other notification on, or in the vicinity of, the petrol dispenser, informing consumers of that fact.
