Article 8
Technical adaptations
Harmonised methods and standards may be adopted for the purposes of Articles 4 and 5. Where necessary to ensure consistency with any relevant standard drawn up by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), those Articles, with the exception of the petrol vapour capture efficiency and vapour/petrol ratio specified in Article 4 and the time periods specified in Article 5, may be adapted to technical progress.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 9(2).
