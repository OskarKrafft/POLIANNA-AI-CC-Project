Article 13
General notification
1.   The notifier may submit a general notification to cover several shipments if, in the case of each shipment:
(a)
the waste has essentially similar physical and chemical characteristics; and
(b)
the waste is shipped to the same consignee and the same facility; and
(c)
the route of the shipment as indicated in the notification document is the same.
2.   If, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the same route cannot be followed, the notifier shall inform the competent authorities concerned as soon as possible and, if possible, before the shipment starts if the need for modification is already known.
Where the route modification is known before the shipment starts and involves competent authorities other than those concerned by the general notification, the general notification may not be used and a new notification shall be submitted.
3.   The competent authorities concerned may make their agreement to the use of a general notification subject to the subsequent provision of additional information and documentation, in accordance with the second subparagraph, points 2 and 3 of Article 4.
