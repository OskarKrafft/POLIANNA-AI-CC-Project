Article 14
Charges for access to networks
1.   Charges applied by network operators for access to networks shall be transparent, take into account the need for network security and reflect actual costs incurred insofar as they correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable network operator and are applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Those charges shall not be distance-related.
2.   Where appropriate, the level of the tariffs applied to producers and/or consumers shall provide locational signals at Community level, and take into account the amount of network losses and congestion caused, and investment costs for infrastructure.
3.   When setting the charges for network access, the following shall be taken into account:
(a)
payments and receipts resulting from the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism;
(b)
actual payments made and received as well as payments expected for future periods of time, estimated on the basis of past periods.
4.   Setting the charges for network access under this Article shall be without prejudice to charges on declared exports and declared imports resulting from congestion management referred to in Article 16.
5.   There shall be no specific network charge on individual transactions for declared transits of electricity.
