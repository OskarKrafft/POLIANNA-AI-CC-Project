Article 9
Monitoring by the Agency
1.   The Agency shall monitor the execution of the tasks referred to in Article 8(1), (2) and (3) of the ENTSO for Electricity and report to the Commission.
The Agency shall monitor the implementation by the ENTSO for Electricity of network codes elaborated under Article 8(2) and network codes which have been developed in accordance with Article 6(1) to (10) but which have not been adopted by the Commission under Article 6(11). Where the ENTSO for Electricity has failed to implement such network codes, the Agency shall request the ENTSO for Electricity to provide a duly reasoned explanation as to why it has failed to do so. The Agency shall inform the Commission of that explanation and provide its opinion thereon.
The Agency shall monitor and analyse the implementation of the network codes and the Guidelines adopted by the Commission as laid down in Article 6(11), and their effect on the harmonisation of applicable rules aimed at facilitating market integration as well as on non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market, and report to the Commission.
2.   The ENTSO for Electricity shall submit the draft Community-wide network development plan, the draft annual work programme, including the information regarding the consultation process, and the other documents referred to in Article 8(3) to the Agency for its opinion.
Within two months from the day of receipt, the Agency shall provide a duly reasoned opinion as well as recommendations to the ENTSO for Electricity and to the Commission where it considers that the draft annual work programme or the draft Community-wide network development plan submitted by the ENTSO for Electricity do not contribute to non-discrimination, effective competition, the efficient functioning of the market or a sufficient level of cross-border interconnection open to third-party access.
