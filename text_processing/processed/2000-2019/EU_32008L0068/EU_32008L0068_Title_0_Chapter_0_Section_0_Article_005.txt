Article 5
Restrictions on grounds of transport safety
1.   Member States may on grounds of transport safety apply more stringent provisions, with the exception of construction requirements, concerning the national transport of dangerous goods by vehicles, wagons and inland waterway vessels registered or put into circulation within their territory.
2.   If, in the event of an accident or incident within its territory, a Member State considers that the safety provisions applicable have been found to be insufficient to limit the hazards involved in transport operations and if there is an urgent need to take action, that Member State shall, at the planning stage, notify the Commission of the measures which it proposes to take.
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9(2), the Commission shall decide whether to authorise the implementation of the measures in question and the duration of that authorisation.
