Article 8
Review and reports
1.   The Commission shall review the need to introduce new emission limits applicable to heavy-duty vehicles and engines in respect of pollutants that are as yet unregulated. The review shall be based on the wider market introduction of new alternative fuels and on the introduction of new additive-enabled exhaust emission control systems to meet future standards laid down in this Directive. Where appropriate, the Commission shall submit a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.
2.   The Commission should submit to the European Parliament and the Council legislative proposals on further limits on NOx and particulate emissions for heavy-duty vehicles.
If appropriate, it shall investigate whether setting an additional limit for particulate levels and size is necessary, and, if so, include it in the proposals.
3.   The Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the progress in negotiations for a worldwide harmonised duty cycle (WHDC).
4.   The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on requirements for the operation of an on-board measurement (OBM) system. On the basis of that report, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a proposal for measures to include the technical specifications and corresponding annexes in order to provide for the type-approval of OBM systems which ensure at least equivalent levels of monitoring to OBD systems and which are compatible therewith.
