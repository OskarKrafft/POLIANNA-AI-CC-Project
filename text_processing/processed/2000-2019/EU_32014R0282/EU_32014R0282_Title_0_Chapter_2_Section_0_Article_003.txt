This objective shall be measured, in particular, through the increase in the advice produced and the number of Member States using the tools and mechanisms identified in order to contribute to effective results in their health systems.
(4)
In order to facilitate access to better and safer healthcare for Union citizens: increase access to medical expertise and information for specific conditions beyond national borders, facilitate the application of the results of research and develop tools for the improvement of healthcare quality and patient safety through, inter alia, actions contributing to the improvement of health literacy.
This objective shall be measured, in particular, through the increase in the number of European reference networks established in accordance with Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the CouncilÂ (22) ("European reference networks"), the increase in the number of healthcare providers and centres of expertise joining European reference networks, and the increase in the number of Member States using the tools developed.
