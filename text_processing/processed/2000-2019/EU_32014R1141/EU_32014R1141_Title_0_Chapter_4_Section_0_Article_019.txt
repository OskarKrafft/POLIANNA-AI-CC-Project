Article 19
Award criteria and distribution of funding
1.   The respective appropriations available to those European political parties and European political foundations which have been awarded contributions or grants in accordance with Article 18 shall be distributed annually on the basis of the following distribution key:
—
15 % shall be distributed in equal shares among the beneficiary European political parties,
—
85 % shall be distributed in proportion to their share of elected members of the European Parliament among the beneficiary European political parties.
The same distribution key shall be used to award funding to European political foundations, on the basis of their affiliation with a European political party.
2.   The distribution referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the number of elected members of the European Parliament who are members of the applicant European political party on the final date for the submission of applications for funding, taking into account Article 17(3).
After that date, any changes to the number shall not affect the respective share of funding between European political parties or European political foundations. This is without prejudice to the requirement in Article 17(1) for a European political party to be represented in the European Parliament by at least one of its members.
