Article 30
Recovery
1.   On the basis of a decision of the Authority removing a European political party or a European political foundation from the Register, the Authorising Officer of the European Parliament shall withdraw or terminate any ongoing decision or agreement on Union funding, except in the cases provided for in point (c) of Article 16(2) and in points (b) and (d) of Article 3(1). He or she shall also recover any Union funding, including any unspent Union funds from previous years.
2.   A European political party or European political foundation on which a sanction has been imposed for any of the infringements listed in Article 27(1) and in points (v) and (vi) of Article 27(2)(a) shall for that reason no longer be in compliance with Article 18(2). As a result, the Authorising Officer of the European Parliament shall terminate the contribution or grant agreement or decision on Union funding received under this Regulation and shall recover amounts unduly paid under the contribution or grant agreement or decision, including any unspent Union funds from previous years.
In the event of such termination, payments by the Authorising Officer of the European Parliament shall be limited to the eligible expenditure actually incurred by the European political party or European political foundation up to the date when the termination decision takes effect.
This paragraph shall also be applicable to the cases referred to in point (c) of Article 16(2) and in points (b) and (d) of Article 3(1).
