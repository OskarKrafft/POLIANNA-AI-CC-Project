Article 5
Content of the national and joint Preventive Action Plans
1.   The national and joint Preventive Action Plans shall contain:
(a)
the results of the risk assessment as laid down in Article 9;
(b)
the measures, volumes, capacities and the timing needed to fulfil the infrastructure and supply standards, as laid down in Articles 6 and 8, including where applicable, the extent to which demand-side measures can sufficiently compensate, in a timely manner, for a supply disruption as referred to in Article 6(2), the identification of the single largest gas infrastructure of common interest in the case of application of Article 6(3) and any increased supply standard under Article 8(2);
(c)
obligations imposed on natural gas undertakings and other relevant bodies, including for the safe operation of the gas system;
(d)
the other preventive measures, such as those relating to the need to enhance interconnections between neighbouring Member States and the possibility to diversify gas routes and sources of supply, if appropriate, to address the risks identified in order to maintain gas supply to all customers as far as possible;
(e)
the mechanisms to be used for cooperation with other Member States for preparing and implementing joint Preventive Action Plans and joint Emergency Plans, as referred to in Article 4(3), where applicable;
(f)
information on existing and future interconnections, including those providing access to the gas network of the Union, cross-border flows, cross-border access to storage facilities and the physical capacity to transport gas in both directions (bi-directional capacity), in particular in the event of an emergency;
(g)
information on all public service obligations that relate to security of gas supply.
2.   The national and joint Preventive Action Plans, in particular the actions to meet the infrastructure standard as laid down in Article 6, shall take into account the Union-wide 10-year network development plan to be elaborated by the ENTSO for Gas pursuant to Article 8(10) of Regulation (EC) No 715/2009.
3.   The national and joint Preventive Action Plans shall be based primarily on market measures, and shall take into account the economic impact, effectiveness and efficiency of the measures, the effects on the functioning of the internal energy market and the impact on the environment and on consumers, and shall not put an undue burden on natural gas undertakings, nor negatively impact on the functioning of the internal market in gas.
4.   The national and joint Preventive Action Plans shall be updated every 2 years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, and shall reflect the updated risk assessment. The consultation provided for between Competent Authorities under Article 4(2) shall be carried out before the adoption of the updated Plan.
