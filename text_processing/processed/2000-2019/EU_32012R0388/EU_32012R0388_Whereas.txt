Whereas:
(1)
Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 (2) requires dual-use items (including software and technology) to be subject to effective control when they are exported from or transit through the Union, or are delivered to a third country as a result of brokering services provided by a broker resident or established in the Union.
(2)
In order to enable Member States and the Union to comply with their international commitments, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes the common list of dual-use items referred to in Article 3 of that Regulation, which implements internationally agreed dual-use controls. These commitments were undertaken within the context of participation in the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Chemical Weapons Convention.
(3)
Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 provides for the list set out in Annex I to be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modification thereof, that Member States have accepted as members of international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties.
(4)
Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 should be amended in order to take account of changes agreed within the Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Wassenaar Arrangement, subsequent to the adoption of that Regulation.
(5)
In order to facilitate references for export control authorities and operators, an updated and consolidated version of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 should be published.
(6)
Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
