3.   The meetings of the Administrative Board shall be convened by its Chairman. The Chairman of the Board of Regulators, or the nominee of the Board of Regulators, and the Director shall participate, without the right to vote, in the deliberations unless the Administrative Board decides otherwise as regards the Director. The Administrative Board shall meet at least twice a year in ordinary session. It shall also meet at the initiative of its Chairman, at the request of the Commission or at the request of at least a third of its members. The Administrative Board may invite any person who may have a relevant opinion to attend its meetings in the capacity of an observer. The members of the Administrative Board may, subject to its rules of procedure, be assisted by advisers or experts. The Administrative Board’s secretarial services shall be provided by the Agency.

5.   The rules of procedure shall set out in greater detail:
(a)
the arrangements governing voting, in particular the conditions on the basis of which one member may act on behalf of another and also, where appropriate, the rules governing quorums; and
(b)
the arrangements governing the rotation applicable to the renewal of the members of the Administrative Board who are appointed by the Council so as to ensure a balanced participation of Member States over time.
6.   A member of the Administrative Board shall not be a member of the Board of Regulators.
7.   The members of the Administrative Board shall undertake to act independently and objectively in the public interest, without seeking or following any political instructions.

Those declarations shall be made public annually.
