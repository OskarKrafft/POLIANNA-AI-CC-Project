Article 28
Protection of the financial interests of the Union
1.   The Commission shall take appropriate measures to ensure that, where activities financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Union are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative and financial penalties.
2.   The Commission or its representatives and the Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, on the basis of documents and on-the-spot checks, over all beneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who have received Union funds under the LIFE Programme.
The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding in accordance with the procedures laid down in Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 (25) with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement or grant decision or a contract concerning Union funding.
Without prejudice to the first and second subparagraphs, cooperation agreements with third countries and international organisations and grant agreements, grant decisions and contracts resulting from the implementation of this Regulation shall expressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections.
3.   Beneficiaries of Union funds shall keep available to the Commission, for a period of five years following the last payment in respect of any project, all supporting documents regarding the expenditure on that project.
