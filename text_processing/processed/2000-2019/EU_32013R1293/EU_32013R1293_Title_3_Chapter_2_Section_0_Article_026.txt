Article 26
Administrative and technical assistance
The financial allocation of the LIFE Programme may also cover necessary expenditure relating to preparatory, monitoring, control, audit, communication and evaluation activities required directly for the management of the LIFE Programme and the achievement of its general objectives set out in Article 3.
The Commission shall, on a regular basis and in collaboration with the LIFE national contact points, organise seminars and workshops, publish lists of projects funded under the LIFE Programme or undertake other activities to facilitate exchanges of experience, knowledge and best practices on all projects and the replication and transfer of project results across the Union. To that end, the Commission shall undertake activities targeting the dissemination of project results amongst LIFE beneficiaries and others with a specific focus, where relevant, on Member States with a low uptake of LIFE funds and shall facilitate the communication and cooperation between completed or ongoing projects with new project beneficiaries, applicants or stakeholders in the same field.
The Commission shall also organise specific seminars, workshops or, where appropriate, other types of activities at least every two years to facilitate exchanges of experience, knowledge and best practices as regards the design, preparation and implementation of integrated projects as well as on the effectiveness of the assistance provided through technical assistance projects. Those activities shall involve national or regional administrations managing other Union funds and other relevant stakeholders.
