Article 61
Proof of good repute
1.   Where a Member State requires of its own nationals proof of good repute and proof of no previous bankruptcy, or proof of either of these, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States the production of an extract from the ‘judicial record’ or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the home Member State or the Member State from which the foreign national comes showing that these requirements have been met.
2.   Where the home Member State or the Member State from which the foreign national concerned comes does not issue the document referred to in paragraph 1, it may be replaced by a declaration on oath — or in States where there is no provision for declaration on oath by a solemn declaration — made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority or, where appropriate, a notary in the home Member State or the Member State from which that person comes; such authority or notary shall issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. The declaration in respect of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional or trade body in the said country.
3.   Documents issued in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 must not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.
4.   Member States shall designate the authorities and bodies competent to issue the documents referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof.
Each Member State shall also inform the other Member States and the Commission of the authorities or bodies to which the documents referred to in this Article are to be submitted in support of an application to carry on in the territory of this Member State the activities referred to in Article 2.
