Article 55
Solvency margin and guarantee fund
1.   Each Member State shall require of agencies or branches set up in its territory a solvency margin consisting of the items listed in Article 27. The minimum solvency margin shall be calculated in accordance with Article 28. However, for the purpose of calculating this margin, account shall be taken only of the operations effected by the agency or branch concerned.
2.   One third of the minimum solvency margin shall constitute the guarantee fund.
However, the amount of this fund may not be less than one half of the minimum required under Article 29(2) first subparagraph. The initial deposit lodged in accordance with Article 51(2)(e) shall be counted towards such guarantee fund.
The guarantee fund and the minimum of such fund shall be constituted in accordance with Article 29.
3.   The assets representing the minimum solvency margin must be kept within the Member State where activities are carried on up to the amount of the guarantee fund and the excess within the Community.
