ArticleÂ 54
Technical provisions
Member States shall require undertakings to establish provisions, referred to in Article 20, adequate to cover the underwriting liabilities assumed in their territories. Member States shall see that the agency or branch covers such provisions by means of assets which are equivalent to such provisions and matching assets in accordance with Annex II.
The law of the Member States shall be applicable to the calculation of such provisions, the determination of categories of investment and the valuation of assets, and, where appropriate, the determination of the extent to which these assets may be used for the purpose of covering such provisions.
The Member State in question shall require that the assets covering these provisions, shall be localised in its territory. Article 20(4) shall, however, apply.
