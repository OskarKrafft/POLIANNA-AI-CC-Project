An assurance undertaking may also adopt the form of a European company when that has been established.
Furthermore, Member States may, where appropriate, set up undertakings in any public-law form provided that such bodies have as their object insurance operations under conditions equivalent to those under which private-law undertakings operate;
(b)
limit its objects to the business provided for in this Directive and operations directly arising therefrom, to the exclusion of all other commercial business;
(c)
submit a scheme of operations in accordance with Article 7;
(d)
possess the minimum guarantee fund provided for in Article 29(2);
(e)
be effectively run by persons of good repute with appropriate professional qualifications or experience.
2.   Where close links exist between the assurance undertaking and other natural or legal persons, the competent authorities shall grant authorisation only if those links do not prevent the effective exercise of their supervisory functions.
The competent authorities shall also refuse authorisation if the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a non-member country governing one or more natural or legal persons with which the assurance undertaking has close links, or difficulties involved in their enforcement, prevent the effective exercise of their supervisory functions.
The competent authorities shall require assurance undertakings to provide them with the information they require to monitor compliance with the conditions referred to in this paragraph on a continuous basis.
3.   Member States shall require that the head offices of insurance undertakings be situated in the same Member State as their registered offices.

Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, for the sole purpose of verifying compliance with national provisions concerning actuarial principles, the home Member State may require systematic notification of the technical bases used for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions, without that requirement constituting a prior condition for an assurance undertaking to carry on its business.
Nothing in this Directive shall prevent Member States from maintaining in force or introducing laws, regulations or administrative provisions requiring approval of the memorandum and articles of association and the communication of any other documents necessary for the normal exercise of supervision.
Not later than 1 July 1999, the Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the implementation of this paragraph.
6.   The provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 may not require that any application for authorisation be considered in the light of the economic requirements of the market.
