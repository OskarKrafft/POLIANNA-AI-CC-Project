ArticleÂ 45
Rules relating to conditions of assurance and scales of premiums
The Member State of the branch or of the provision of services shall not lay down provisions requiring the prior approval or systematic notification of general and special policy conditions, scales of premiums, technical bases used in particular for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions, forms and other printed documents which an assurance undertaking intends to use in its dealings with policy holders. For the purpose of verifying compliance with national provisions concerning assurance contracts, it may require an assurance undertaking that proposes to carry on assurance business within its territory, under the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services, to effect only non-systematic notification of those policy conditions and other printed documents without that requirement constituting a prior condition for an assurance undertaking to carry on its business.
