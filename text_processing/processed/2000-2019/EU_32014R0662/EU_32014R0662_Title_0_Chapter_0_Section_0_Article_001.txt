any net transfers of annual emission allocations in accordance with Decision No 406/2009/EC and any net transfers of allowances with third countries participating in the scheme established for greenhouse gas emissions trading within the Union by Directive 2003/87/EC which are not parties to a joint fulfilment agreement, are followed by a transfer of a corresponding number of AAUs through a clearing process at the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol,

For that purpose, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt implementing acts to transfer CERs, ERUs or AAUs held in the Union registry to the registry of that Member State. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 26(2).
