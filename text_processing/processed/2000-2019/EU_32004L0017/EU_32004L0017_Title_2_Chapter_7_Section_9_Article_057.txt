Article 57
Abnormally low tenders
1. If, for a given contract, tenders appear to be abnormally low in relation to the goods, works or services, the contracting entity shall, before it may reject those tenders, request in writing details of the constituent elements of the tender which it considers relevant.
Those details may relate in particular to:
(a) the economics of the manufacturing process, of the services provided and of the construction method;
(b) the technical solutions chosen and/or any exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer for the supply of the goods or services or for the execution of the work;
(c) the originality of the supplies, services or work proposed by the tenderer;
(d) compliance with the provisions relating to employment protection and working conditions in force at the place where the work, service or supply is to be performed;
(e) the possibility of the tenderer obtaining State aid.
2. The contracting entity shall verify those constituent elements by consulting the tenderer, taking account of the evidence supplied.
3. Where a contracting entity establishes that a tender is abnormally low because the tenderer has obtained State aid, the tender can be rejected on that ground alone only after consultation with the tenderer where the latter is unable to prove, within a sufficient time limit fixed by the contracting entity, that the aid in question was granted legally. Where the contracting entity rejects a tender in these circumstances, it shall inform the Commission of that fact.
