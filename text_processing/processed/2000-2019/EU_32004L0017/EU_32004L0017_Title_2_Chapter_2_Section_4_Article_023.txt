Article 23
Contracts awarded to an affiliated undertaking, to a joint venture or to a contracting entity forming part of a joint venture
1. For the purposes of this Article, "affiliated undertaking" means any undertaking the annual accounts of which are consolidated with those of the contracting entity in accordance with the requirements of the Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 based on the Article 44(2)(g) of the Treaty on consolidated accounts(27)(28), or, in the case of entities not subject to that Directive, any undertaking over which the contracting entity may exercise, directly or indirectly, a dominant influence within the meaning of Article 2(1)(b) hereof or which may exercise a dominant influence over the contracting entity or which, in common with the contracting entity, is subject to the dominant influence of another undertaking by virtue of ownership, financial participation, or the rules which govern it.
2. Provided that the conditions in paragraph 3 are met, this Directive shall not apply to contracts awarded:
(a) by a contracting entity to an affiliated undertaking, or
(b) by a joint venture, formed exclusively by a number of contracting entities for the purpose of carrying out activities within the meaning of Articles 3 to 7, to an undertaking which is affiliated with one of these contracting entities.
3. Paragraph 2 shall apply:
(a) to service contracts provided that at least 80 % of the average turnover of the affiliated undertaking with respect to services for the preceding three years derives from the provision of such services to undertakings with which it is affiliated;
(b) to supplies contracts provided that at least 80 % of the average turnover of the affiliated undertaking with respect to supplies for the preceding three years derives from the provision of such supplies to undertakings with which it is affiliated;
(c) to works contracts provided that at least 80 % of the average turnover of the affiliated undertaking with respect to works for the preceding three years derives from the provision of such works to undertakings with which it is affiliated.
When, because of the date on which an affiliated undertaking was created or commenced activities, the turnover is not available for the preceding three years, it will be sufficient for that undertaking to show that the turnover referred to in points (a), (b) or (c) is credible, particularly by means of business projections.
Where more than one undertaking affiliated with the contracting entity provides the same or similar services, supplies or works, the above percentages shall be calculated taking into account the total turnover deriving respectively from the provision of services, supplies or works by those affiliated undertakings.
4. This Directive shall not apply to contracts awarded:
(a) by a joint venture, formed exclusively by a number of contracting entities for the purpose of carrying out activities within the meaning of Articles 3 to 7, to one of these contracting entities, or
(b) by a contracting entity to such a joint venture of which it forms part, provided that the joint venture has been set up in order to carry out the activity concerned over a period of at least three years and that the instrument setting up the joint venture stipulates that the contracting entities, which form it, will be part thereof for at least the same period.
5. Contracting entities shall notify to the Commission, at its request, the following information regarding the application of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4:
(a) the names of the undertakings or joint ventures concerned,
(b) the nature and value of the contracts involved,
(c) such proof as may be deemed necessary by the Commission that the relationship between the undertaking or joint venture to which the contracts are awarded and the contracting entity complies with the requirements of this Article.
