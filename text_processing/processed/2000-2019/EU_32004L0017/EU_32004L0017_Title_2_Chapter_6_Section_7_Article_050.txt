Article 50
Information to be stored concerning awards
1. Contracting entities shall keep appropriate information on each contract which shall be sufficient to permit them at a later date to justify decisions taken in connection with:
(a) the qualification and selection of economic operators and the award of contracts;
(b) the use of procedures without a prior call for competition by virtue of Article 40(3);
(c) the non-application of Chapters III to VI of this Title by virtue of the derogations provided for in Chapter II of Title I and in Chapter II of this Title.
Contracting entities shall take appropriate steps to document the progress of award procedures conducted by electronic means.
2. The information shall be kept for at least four years from the date of award of the contract so that the contracting entity will be able, during that period, to provide the necessary information to the Commission if the latter so requests.
