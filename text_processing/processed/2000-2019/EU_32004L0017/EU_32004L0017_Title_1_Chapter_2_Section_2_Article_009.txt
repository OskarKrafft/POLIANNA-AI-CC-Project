Article 9
Contracts covering several activities
1. A contract which is intended to cover several activities shall be subject to the rules applicable to the activity for which it is principally intended.
However, the choice between awarding a single contract and awarding a number of separate contracts may not be made with the objective of excluding it from the scope of this Directive or, where applicable, Directive 2004/18/EC.
2. If one of the activities for which the contract is intended is subject to this Directive and the other to the abovementioned Directive 2004/18/EC and if it is objectively impossible to determine for which activity the contract is principally intended, the contract shall be awarded in accordance with the abovementioned Directive 2004/18/EC.
3. If one of the activities for which the contract is intended is subject to this Directive and the other is not subject to either this Directive or the abovementioned Directive 2004/18/EC, and if it is objectively impossible to determine for which activity the contract is principally intended, the contract shall be awarded in accordance with this Directive.
