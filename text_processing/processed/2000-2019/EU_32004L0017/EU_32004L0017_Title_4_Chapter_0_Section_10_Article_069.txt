Article 69
Revision of the thresholds
1. The Commission shall verify the thresholds established in Article 16 every two years from 30 April 2004, and shall, if necessary with regard to the second subparagraph, revise them in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 68(2).
The calculation of the value of these thresholds shall be based on the average daily value of the euro, expressed in SDR, over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision with effect from 1 January. The value of the thresholds thus revised shall, where necessary, be rounded down to the nearest thousand euro so as to ensure that the thresholds in force provided for by the Agreement, expressed in SDR, are observed.
2. At the same time as performing the revision under paragraph 1, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 68(2), align the thresholds laid down in Article 61 (design contests) with the revised threshold applicable to service contracts.
The values of the thresholds laid down in accordance with paragraph 1 in the national currencies of Member States not participating in Monetary Union shall, in principle, be revised every two years from 1 January 2004. The calculation of such values shall be based on the average daily values of those currencies, expressed in euro, over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision with effect from 1 January.
3. The revised thresholds referred to in paragraph 1, their values in national currencies and the aligned thresholds referred to in paragraph 2 shall be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union at the beginning of the month of November following their revision.
