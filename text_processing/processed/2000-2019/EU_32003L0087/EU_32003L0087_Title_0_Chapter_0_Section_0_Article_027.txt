Article 27
Temporary exclusion of certain installations
1.   Member States may apply to the Commission for installations to be temporarily excluded until 31 December 2007 at the latest from the Community scheme. Any such application shall list each such installation and shall be published.
2.   If, having considered any comments made by the public on that application, the Commission decides, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 23(2), that the installations will:
(a)
as a result of national policies, limit their emissions as much as would be the case if they were subject to the provisions of this Directive;
(b)
be subject to monitoring, reporting and verification requirements which are equivalent to those provided for pursuant to Articles 14 and 15; and
(c)
be subject to penalties at least equivalent to those referred to in Article 16(1) and (4) in the case of non-fulfilment of national requirements;
it shall provide for the temporary exclusion of those installations from the Community scheme.
It must be ensured that there will be no distortion of the internal market.
