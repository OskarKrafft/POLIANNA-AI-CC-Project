Article 30
Review and further development
1.   On the basis of progress achieved in the monitoring of emissions of greenhouse gases, the Commission may make a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2004 to amend Annex I to include other activities and emissions of other greenhouse gases listed in Annex II.
2.   On the basis of experience of the application of this Directive and of progress achieved in the monitoring of emissions of greenhouse gases and in the light of developments in the international context, the Commission shall draw up a report on the application of this Directive, considering:
(a)
how and whether Annex I should be amended to include other relevant sectors, inter alia the chemicals, aluminium and transport sectors, activities and emissions of other greenhouse gases listed in Annex II, with a view to further improving the economic efficiency of the scheme;
(b)
the relationship of Community emission allowance trading with the international emissions trading that will start in 2008;
(c)
further harmonisation of the method of allocation (including auctioning for the time after 2012) and of the criteria for national allocation plans referred to in Annex III;
(d)
the use of credits from project mechanisms;
(e)
the relationship of emissions trading with other policies and measures implemented at Member State and Community level, including taxation, that pursue the same objectives;
(f)
whether it is appropriate for there to be a single Community registry;
(g)
the level of excess emissions penalties, taking into account, inter alia, inflation;
(h)
the functioning of the allowance market, covering in particular any possible market disturbances;
(i)
how to adapt the Community scheme to an enlarged European Union;
(j)
pooling;
(k)
the practicality of developing Community-wide benchmarks as a basis for allocation, taking into account the best available techniques and cost-benefit analysis.
The Commission shall submit this report to the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2006, accompanied by proposals as appropriate.
3.   Linking the project-based mechanisms, including Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with the Community scheme is desirable and important to achieve the goals of both reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the cost-effective functioning of the Community scheme. Therefore, the emission credits from the project-based mechanisms will be recognised for their use in this scheme subject to provisions adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission, which should apply in parallel with the Community scheme in 2005. The use of the mechanisms shall be supplemental to domestic action, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Kyoto Protocol and Marrakesh Accords.
