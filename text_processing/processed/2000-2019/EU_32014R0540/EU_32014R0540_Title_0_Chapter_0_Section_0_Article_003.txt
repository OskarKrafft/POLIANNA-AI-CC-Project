(iii)
vehicles having the same type of engine and/or different overall gear ratios may be regarded as vehicles of the same type.
However, if the differences in point (b) provide for different target conditions, as described in point 4.1.2.2 of Annex II, those differences shall be regarded as a change of type;
(3)
‘technically permissible maximum laden mass’ (M) means the maximum mass allocated to a vehicle on the basis of its construction features and its design performance; the technically permissible laden mass of a trailer or of a semi-trailer includes the static mass transferred to the towing vehicle when coupled;
(4)

If the rated maximum net power is reached at several engine speeds, the highest engine speed shall be used;
(5)
‘standard equipment’ means the basic configuration of a vehicle including all features that are fitted without giving rise to any further specifications on configuration or equipment level but equipped with all the features required under the regulatory acts mentioned in Annex IV or Annex XI to Directive 2007/46/EC;
(6)
‘mass of the driver’ means a mass rated at 75 kg located at the driver's seating reference point;
(7)
‘mass of a vehicle in running order’ (mro) means
(a)
in the case of a motor vehicle:
the mass of the vehicle, with its fuel tank(s) filled to at least 90 % of its or their capacity/ies, including the mass of the driver, the fuel and liquids, fitted with the standard equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and, where they are fitted, the mass of the bodywork, the cabin, the coupling and the spare wheel(s) as well as the tools;
(b)
in the case of a trailer:
the mass of the vehicle including the fuel and liquids, fitted with the standard equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, and, when they are fitted, the mass of the bodywork, additional coupling(s), the spare wheel(s) and the tools;
(8)
‘rated engine speed’ (S) means the declared engine speed in min–1 (rpm) at which the engine develops its rated maximum net power pursuant to UNECE Regulation No 85 or, where the rated maximum net power is reached at several engine speeds, the highest one of those speeds;
(9)
‘power to mass ratio index’ (PMR) means a numerical quantity calculated in accordance with the formula set out in point 4.1.2.1.1 of Annex II;
(10)
‘reference point’ means one of the following points:
(a)
in the case of vehicles of categories M1 and N1:
(i)
for front engine vehicles, the front end of the vehicle;
(ii)
for mid engine vehicles, the centre of the vehicle;
(iii)
for rear engine vehicles, the rear end of the vehicle.
(b)
in the case of vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3, the border of the engine closest to the front of the vehicle.
(11)
‘target acceleration’ means acceleration at a partial throttle condition in urban traffic as derived from statistical investigations;
(12)
‘engine’ means the power source without detachable accessories;
(13)
‘reference acceleration’ means the required acceleration during the acceleration test on the test track;
(14)
‘gear ratio weighting factor’ (k) means a dimensionless numerical quantity used to combine the test results of two gear ratios for the acceleration test and the constant speed test;
(15)
‘partial power factor’ (kP) means a numerical quantity with no dimension used for the weighted combination of the test results of the acceleration test and the constant speed test for vehicles;
(16)
‘pre-acceleration’ means the application of an acceleration control device prior to AA' for the purpose of achieving stable acceleration between AA' and BB' as referred to in Figure 1 of the Appendix to Annex II;
(17)
