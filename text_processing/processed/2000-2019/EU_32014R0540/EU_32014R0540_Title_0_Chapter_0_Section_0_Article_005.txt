Article 5
General obligations of manufacturers
1.   Manufacturers shall ensure that vehicles, their engine and their silencing system are designed, constructed and assembled so as to enable such vehicles, when in normal use, to comply with this Regulation, despite the vibration to which such vehicles are inherently subjected.
2.   Manufacturers shall ensure that silencing systems are designed, constructed and assembled so as to be able to reasonably resist the corrosive phenomena to which they are exposed having regard to the conditions of use of vehicles, including regional climate differences.
3.   The manufacturer shall be responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the approval process and for ensuring conformity of production, whether or not the manufacturer is directly involved in all stages of the construction of a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit.
