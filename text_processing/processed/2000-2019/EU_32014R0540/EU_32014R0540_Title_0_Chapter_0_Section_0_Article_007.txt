Article 7
Consumer information and labelling
Vehicle manufacturers and distributors shall endeavour to ensure that the sound level of each vehicle in decibels (dB(a)), measured in accordance with this Regulation, is displayed in a prominent position at the point of sale and in technical promotional material.
In the light of the experience gained in the application of this Regulation, the Commission shall, by 1 July 2018 carry out a comprehensive impact assessment on labelling conditions applicable to air and noise pollution levels and on consumer information. The Commission shall report on the findings of that assessment to the European Parliament and to the Council and, if appropriate, submit a legislative proposal.
