Article 20
Pilot studies
1.   Where the Commission (Eurostat) identifies a need for significant new data requirements or improvements to the data sets covered by this Regulation, it may launch pilot studies to be carried out by the Member States on a voluntary basis before any new data collection. Those pilot studies include pilot studies on international trade in services, real estate, financial indicators and environment and climate.
2.   Such pilot studies shall be carried out in order to assess the relevance and feasibility of obtaining data. The results of those studies shall be evaluated by the Commission (Eurostat) in cooperation with Member States and the main stakeholders. The evaluation of the results shall take into account the benefits and the additional costs and burden for businesses and for NSAs of having the improvements.
3.   Following the evaluation referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission shall prepare in cooperation with the Member States a report on the findings of the studies referred to in paragraph 1. That report shall be made public.
4.   The Commission shall report by 7 January 2022 and every two years thereafter on the overall progress made regarding the pilot studies referred to in paragraph 1. Those reports shall be made public.
The Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the evaluation of the results referred to in paragraph 2, accompany those reports by proposals for introducing new data requirements.
