Article 24
Derogations
1.   Where the application of this Regulation or the implementing measures and delegated acts adopted pursuant thereto in a national statistical system of a Member State necessitates major adaptations, the Commission may adopt implementing acts granting derogations therefrom for a maximum duration of three years.
The relevant Member State shall submit a duly reasoned request for such a derogation to the Commission within three months of the date of the entry into force of the act concerned.
The impact by such derogations on comparability of Member States' data or on the calculation of the required timely and representative European aggregates shall be kept to a minimum. The burden on respondents shall be taken into account when granting the derogation.
2.   Where a derogation concerning the areas in which pilot studies as referred to in Article 20 have been carried out remains justified at the end of the period for which it was granted, the Commission may adopt an implementing act granting a further derogation for a maximum period of one year.
The relevant Member State shall submit a request setting out the reasons and detailed grounds in support of such an extension to the Commission not later than six months before the end of the period of validity of the derogation granted pursuant to paragraph 1.
3.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 23(2).
