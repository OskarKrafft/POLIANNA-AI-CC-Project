Article 19
Community emission limit values
1.   Where the need for Community action has been identified, on the basis, in particular, of the exchange of information provided for in Article 17, the European Parliament and the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall set emission limit values, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty, for:
(a)
the categories of installations listed in Annex I except for the landfills covered by points 5,1 and 5,4 of that Annex,
and
(b)
the polluting substances referred to in Annex III.

3.   Without prejudice to the requirements of this Directive, the technical requirements applicable for the landfills covered by points 5,1 and 5,4 of Annex I, have been fixed in Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (18).
