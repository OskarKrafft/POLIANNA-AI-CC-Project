Changes by operators to installations
1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the operator informs the competent authorities of any planned change in the operation. Where appropriate, the competent authorities shall update the permit or the conditions.
2.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that no substantial change planned by the operator is made without a permit issued in accordance with this Directive. The application for a permit and the decision by the competent authority must cover those parts of the installation and those aspects listed in Article 6 that may be affected by the change.
