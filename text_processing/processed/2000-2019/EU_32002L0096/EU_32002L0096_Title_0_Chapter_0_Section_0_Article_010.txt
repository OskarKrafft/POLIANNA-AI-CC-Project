Article 10
Information for users
1. Member States shall ensure that users of electrical and electronic equipment in private households are given the necessary information about:
(a) the requirement not to dispose of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to collect such WEEE separately;
(b) the return and collection systems available to them;
(c) their role in contributing to reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery of WEEE;
(d) the potential effects on the environment and human health as a result of the presence of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment;
(e) the meaning of the symbol shown in Annex IV.
2. Member States shall adopt appropriate measures so that consumers participate in the collection of WEEE and to encourage them to facilitate the process of reuse, treatment and recovery.
3. With a view to minimising the disposal of WEEE as unsorted municipal waste and to facilitating its separate collection, Member States shall ensure that producers appropriately mark electrical and electronic equipment put on the market after 13 August 2005 with the symbol shown in Annex IV. In exceptional cases, where this is necessary because of the size or the function of the product, the symbol shall be printed on the packaging, on the instructions for use and on the warranty of the electrical and electronic equipment.
4. Member States may require that some or all of the information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be provided by producers and/or distributors, e.g. in the instructions for use or at the point of sale.
