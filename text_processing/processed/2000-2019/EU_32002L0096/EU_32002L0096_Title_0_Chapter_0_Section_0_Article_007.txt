Article 7
Recovery
1. Member States shall ensure that producers or third parties acting on their behalf set up systems either on an individual or on a collective basis, in accordance with Community legislation, to provide for the recovery of WEEE collected separately in accordance with Article 5. Member States shall give priority to the reuse of whole appliances. Until the date referred to in paragraph 4, such appliances shall not be taken into account for the calculation of the targets set out in paragraph 2.
2. Regarding WEEE sent for treatment in accordance with Article 6, Member States shall ensure that, by 31 December 2006, producers meet the following targets:
(a) for WEEE falling under categories 1 and 10 of Annex IA,
- the rate of recovery shall be increased to a minimum of 80 % by an average weight per appliance, and
- component, material and substance reuse and recycling shall be increased to a minimum of 75 % by an average weight per appliance;
(b) for WEEE falling under categories 3 and 4 of Annex IA,
- the rate of recovery shall be increased to a minimum of 75 % by an average weight per appliance, and
- component, material and substance reuse and recycling shall be increased to a minimum of 65 % by an average weight per appliance;
(c) for WEEE falling under categories 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 of Annex IA,
- the rate of recovery shall be increased to a minimum of 70 % by an average weight per appliance, and
- component, material and substance reuse and recycling shall be increased to a minimum of 50 % by an average weight per appliance;
(d) for gas discharge lamps, the rate of component, material and substance reuse and recycling shall reach a minimum of 80 % by weight of the lamps.
3. Member States shall ensure that, for the purpose of calculating these targets, producers or third parties acting on their behalf keep records on the mass of WEEE, their components, materials or substances when entering (input) and leaving (output) the treatment facility and/or when entering (input) the recovery or recycling facility.
The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14(2), establish the detailed rules for monitoring compliance, including specifications for materials, of Member States with the targets set out in paragraph 2. The Commission shall submit this measure by 13 August 2004.
4. The European Parliament and the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall establish new targets for recovery and reuse/recycling, including for the reuse of whole appliances as appropriate, and for the products falling under category 8 of Annex IA, by 31 December 2008. This shall be done with account being taken of the environmental benefits of electrical and electronic equipment in use, such as improved resource efficiency resulting from developments in the areas of materials and technology. Technical progress in reuse, recovery and recycling, products and materials, and the experience gained by the Member States and the industry, shall also be taken into account.
5. Member States shall encourage the development of new recovery, recycling and treatment technologies.
