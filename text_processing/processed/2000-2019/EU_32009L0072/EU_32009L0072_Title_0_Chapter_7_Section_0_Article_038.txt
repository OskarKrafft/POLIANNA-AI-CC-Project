(a)
foster the creation of operational arrangements in order to enable an optimal management of the network, promote joint electricity exchanges and the allocation of cross-border capacity, and to enable an adequate level of interconnection capacity, including through new interconnection, within the region and between regions to allow for development of effective competition and improvement of security of supply, without discriminating between supply undertakings in different Member States;
(b)
coordinate the development of all network codes for the relevant transmission system operators and other market actors; and
(c)
coordinate the development of the rules governing the management of congestion.
3.   National regulatory authorities shall have the right to enter into cooperative arrangements with each other to foster regulatory cooperation.
