Article 67
Assessment by Member States
1.   Member States shall ensure that the persons validating and assessing the application, or deciding on it, do not have conflicts of interest, are independent of the sponsor, the investigators involved and of natural or legal persons financing the performance study, as well as free of any other undue influence.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the assessment is done jointly by a reasonable number of persons who collectively have the necessary qualifications and experience.
3.   Member States shall assess whether the performance study is designed in such a way that potential remaining risks to subjects or third persons, after risk minimization, are justified, when weighed against the clinical benefits to be expected. They shall, while taking into account applicable CS or harmonised standards, examine in particular:
(a)
the demonstration of compliance of the device(s) for performance study with the applicable general safety and performance requirements, apart from the aspects covered by the performance study, and whether, with regard to those aspects, every precaution has been taken to protect the health and safety of the subjects. This includes, in case of performance studies, the evaluation of the analytical performance, and in case of interventional clinical performance studies, the evaluation of the analytical performance, clinical performance and scientific validity, taking into consideration the state of the art;
(b)
whether the risk-minimisation solutions employed by the sponsor are described in harmonised standards and, in those cases where the sponsor does not use harmonised standards, whether the risk-minimisation solutions provide a level of protection that is equivalent to that provided by harmonised standards;
(c)
whether the measures planned for the safe installation, putting into service and maintenance of the device for performance study are adequate;
(d)
the reliability and robustness of the data generated in the performance study, taking account of statistical approaches, design of the performance study and methodological aspects, including sample size, comparator and endpoints;
(e)
whether the requirements of Annex XIV are met.
4.   Member States shall refuse the authorisation of the performance study if:
(a)
the application dossier submitted pursuant to Article 66(3) remains incomplete;
(b)
the device or the submitted documents, especially the performance study plan and the investigator's brochure, do not correspond to the state of scientific knowledge, and the performance study, in particular, is not suitable for providing evidence for the safety, performance characteristics or benefit of the device on subjects or patients;
(c)
the requirements of Article 58 are not met; or
(d)
any assessment under paragraph 3 is negative.
Member States shall provide for an appeal procedure in respect of a refusal pursuant to the first subparagraph.
