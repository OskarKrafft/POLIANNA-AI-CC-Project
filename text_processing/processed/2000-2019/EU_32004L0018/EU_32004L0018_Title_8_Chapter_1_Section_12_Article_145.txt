Article 61
Awarding of additional works to the concessionaire
This Directive shall not apply to additional works not included in the concession project initially considered or in the initial contract but which have, through unforeseen circumstances, become necessary for the performance of the work described therein, which the contracting authority has awarded to the concessionaire, on condition that the award is made to the economic operator performing such work:
—
when such additional works cannot be technically or economically separated from the initial contract without major inconvenience to the contracting authorities, or
—
when such works, although separable from the performance of the initial contract, are strictly necessary for its completion.
However, the aggregate value of contracts awarded for additional works may not exceed 50 % of the amount of the original works concession contract.
