Article 6
1.   Member States shall, at the level of the river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), prepare flood hazard maps and flood risk maps, at the most appropriate scale for the areas identified under Article 5(1).
2.   The preparation of flood hazard maps and flood risk maps for areas identified under Article 5 which are shared with other Member States shall be subject to prior exchange of information between the Member States concerned.
3.   Flood hazard maps shall cover the geographical areas which could be flooded according to the following scenarios:
(a)
floods with a low probability, or extreme event scenarios;
(b)
floods with a medium probability (likely return period ≥ 100 years);
(c)
floods with a high probability, where appropriate.
4.   For each scenario referred to in paragraph 3 the following elements shall be shown:
(a)
the flood extent;
(b)
water depths or water level, as appropriate;
(c)
where appropriate, the flow velocity or the relevant water flow.
5.   Flood risk maps shall show the potential adverse consequences associated with flood scenarios referred to in paragraph 3 and expressed in terms of the following:
(a)
the indicative number of inhabitants potentially affected;
(b)
type of economic activity of the area potentially affected;
(c)
installations as referred to in Annex I to Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (9) which might cause accidental pollution in case of flooding and potentially affected protected areas identified in Annex IV(1)(i), (iii) and (v) to Directive 2000/60/EC;
(d)
other information which the Member State considers useful such as the indication of areas where floods with a high content of transported sediments and debris floods can occur and information on other significant sources of pollution.
6.   Member States may decide that, for coastal areas where an adequate level of protection is in place, the preparation of flood hazard maps shall be limited to the scenario referred to in paragraph 3(a).
7.   Member States may decide that, for areas where flooding is from groundwater sources, the preparation of flood hazard maps shall be limited to the scenario referred to in paragraph 3(a).
8.   Member States shall ensure that the flood hazard maps and flood risk maps are completed by 22 December 2013.
