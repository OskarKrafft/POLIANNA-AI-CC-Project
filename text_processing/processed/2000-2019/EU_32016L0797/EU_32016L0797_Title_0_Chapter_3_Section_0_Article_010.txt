Article 10
Procedure for ‘EC’ declaration of conformity or suitability for use
1.   In order to establish the ‘EC’ declaration of conformity or suitability for use of an interoperability constituent, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall apply the provisions laid down by the relevant TSIs.
2.   Where the corresponding TSI so requires, assessment of the conformity or suitability for use of an interoperability constituent shall be carried out by the notified body with which the manufacturer or his authorised representative has lodged the application.
3.   Where interoperability constituents are the subject of other legal acts of the Union covering other matters, the ‘EC’ declaration of conformity or suitability for use shall state that the interoperability constituents also meet the requirements of those other legal acts.
4.   Where neither the manufacturer nor his authorised representative has met the obligations laid down in paragraphs 1 and 3, those obligations shall be incumbent on any person who places interoperability constituents on the market. For the purposes of this Directive, the same obligations shall apply to any person who assembles interoperability constituents, or parts of interoperability constituents having diverse origins, or manufactures interoperability constituents for his own use.
5.   If a Member State finds that the ‘EC’ declaration has been drawn up improperly, it shall ensure that the interoperability constituent is not placed on the market. In such a case, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall be required to restore the interoperability constituent to a state of conformity under the conditions laid down by that Member State.
