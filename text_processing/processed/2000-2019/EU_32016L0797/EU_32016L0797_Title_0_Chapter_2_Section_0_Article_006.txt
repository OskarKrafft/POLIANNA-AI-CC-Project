Article 6
Deficiencies in TSIs
1.   If, after its adoption, it appears that a TSI has a deficiency, that TSI shall be amended in accordance with Article 5(11). If appropriate, the Commission shall apply this procedure without delay. Such deficiencies shall include cases which could result in unsafe operations within a Member State.
2.   Pending the review of a TSI, the Commission may request an opinion from the Agency. The Commission shall analyse the Agency's opinion and inform the committee of its conclusions.
3.   At the request of the Commission, the Agency's opinion referred to in paragraph 2 shall constitute acceptable means of compliance and may therefore be used for the assessment of projects, pending the adoption of a revised TSI.
4.   Any member of the network of representative bodies referred to in Article 38(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/796 may make the Commission aware of possible TSI deficiencies.
