Article 3
National indicative targets
1. Member States shall take appropriate steps to encourage greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with the national indicative targets referred to in paragraph 2. These steps must be in proportion to the objective to be attained.
2. Not later than 27 October 2002 and every five years thereafter, Member States shall adopt and publish a report setting national indicative targets for future consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in terms of a percentage of electricity consumption for the next 10 years. The report shall also outline the measures taken or planned, at national level, to achieve these national indicative targets. To set these targets until the year 2010, the Member States shall:
- take account of the reference values in the Annex,
- ensure that the targets are compatible with any national commitments accepted in the context of the climate change commitments accepted by the Community pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
3. Member States shall publish, for the first time not later than 27 October 2003 and thereafter every two years, a report which includes an analysis of success in meeting the national indicative targets taking account, in particular, of climatic factors likely to affect the achievement of those targets and which indicates to what extent the measures taken are consistent with the national climate change commitment.
4. On the basis of the Member States' reports referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Commission shall assess to what extent:
- Member States have made progress towards achieving their national indicative targets,
- the national indicative targets are consistent with the global indicative target of 12 % of gross national energy consumption by 2010 and in particular with the 22,1 % indicative share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in total Community electricity consumption by 2010.
The Commission shall publish its conclusions in a report, for the first time not later than 27 October 2004 and thereafter every two years. This report shall be accompanied, as appropriate, by proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council.
If the report referred to in the second subparagraph concludes that the national indicative targets are likely to be inconsistent, for reasons that are unjustified and/or do not relate to new scientific evidence, with the global indicative target, these proposals shall address national targets, including possible mandatory targets, in the appropriate form.
