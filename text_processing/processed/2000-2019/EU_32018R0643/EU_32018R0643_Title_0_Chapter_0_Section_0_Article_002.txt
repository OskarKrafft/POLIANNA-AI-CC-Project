Article 2
Scope
This Regulation shall cover all railways in the Union. Each Member State shall report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory. Where a railway undertaking operates in more than one Member State, the national authorities concerned shall require the undertaking to provide data separately for each country in which it operates so as to enable national statistics to be compiled.
Member States may exclude from the scope of this Regulation:
(a)
railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours;
(b)
railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways.
