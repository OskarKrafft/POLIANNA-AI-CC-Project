Article 25
Applications in exceptional circumstances
By way of derogation from point (b) of Article 8(1), in exceptional circumstances related to animal or public health, an applicant may submit an application which does not meet all requirements of that point, for which the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the veterinary medicinal product concerned to the animal or public health outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that certain quality, safety or efficacy documentation has not been provided. In such a case, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate that for objective and verifiable reasons certain quality, safety or efficacy documentation required in accordance with Annex II cannot be provided.
