Article 19
Hybrid veterinary medicinal products
1.   By way of derogation from Article 18(1), the results of appropriate pre-clinical studies or clinical trials shall be required when the veterinary medicinal product does not meet all the characteristics of a generic veterinary medicinal product because of one or more of the following reasons:
(a)
there are changes in the active substance or substances, indications for use, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic veterinary medicinal product compared to the reference veterinary medicinal product;
(b)
bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence with the reference veterinary medicinal product; or
(c)
there are differences relating to raw materials or in manufacturing processes of the biological veterinary medicinal product and the reference biological veterinary medicinal product.
2.   The pre-clinical studies or clinical trials for a hybrid veterinary medicinal product may be conducted with batches of the reference veterinary medicinal product authorised in the Union or in a third country.
The applicant shall demonstrate that the reference veterinary medicinal product authorised in a third country has been authorised in accordance with requirements equivalent to those established in the Union for the reference veterinary medicinal product and are so highly similar that they can substitute each other in the clinical trials.
