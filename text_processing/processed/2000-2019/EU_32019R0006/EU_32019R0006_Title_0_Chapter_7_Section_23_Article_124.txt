Article 124
Audits by the Commission
The Commission may carry out audits in Member States on their competent authorities for the purpose of confirming the appropriateness of the controls carried out by those competent authorities. Such audits shall be coordinated with the relevant Member State and shall be carried out in a manner which avoids unnecessary administrative burden.
After each audit, the Commission shall draft a report containing, where appropriate, recommendations to the relevant Member State. The Commission shall send the draft report to the competent authority for comments and shall take into account any such comments in drawing up the final report. The final report and the comments shall be made public by the Commission.
