Article 36
Decisions granting marketing authorisations
1.   Decisions granting marketing authorisations referred to in Article 5(1) shall be taken on the basis of the documents prepared in accordance with Article 33(1) and shall set out any conditions attached to the placing on the market of the veterinary medicinal product and the summary of the product characteristics (‘terms of the marketing authorisation’).
2.   Where the application concerns an antimicrobial veterinary medicinal product, the competent authority or the Commission, as applicable, may require the marketing authorisation holder to conduct post-authorisation studies in order to ensure that the benefit-risk balance remains positive given the potential development of antimicrobial resistance.
