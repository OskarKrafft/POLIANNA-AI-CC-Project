ArticleÂ 33
Glossary of common ingredient names
The Commission shall compile and update a glossary of common ingredient names. To this end, the Commission shall take account of internationally recognised nomenclatures including the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI). That glossary shall not constitute a list of the substances authorised for use in cosmetic products.
The common ingredient name shall be applied for the purpose of labelling cosmetic products placed on the market at the latest twelve months after publication of the glossary in the Official Journal of the European Union.
