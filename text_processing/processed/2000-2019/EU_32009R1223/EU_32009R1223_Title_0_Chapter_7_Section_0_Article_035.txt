Every year the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on:
(1)
progress made in the development, validation and legal acceptance of alternative methods.

(2)
progress made by the Commission in its efforts to obtain acceptance by the OECD of alternative methods validated at Community level and recognition by third countries of the results of the safety tests carried out in the Community using alternative methods, in particular within the framework of cooperation agreements between the Community and these countries;
(3)
the manner in which the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises have been taken into account.
