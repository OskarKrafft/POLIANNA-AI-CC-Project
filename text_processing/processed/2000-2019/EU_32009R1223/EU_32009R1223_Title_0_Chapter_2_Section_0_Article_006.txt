Article 6
Obligations of distributors
1.   In the context of their activities, when making a cosmetic product available on the market, distributors shall act with due care in relation to applicable requirements.
2.   Before making a cosmetic product available on the market distributors shall verify that:
—
the labelling information provided for in Article 19(1)(a), (e) and (g) and Article 19(3) and (4) is present,
—
the language requirements provided for in Article 19(5) are fulfilled,
—
the date of minimum durability specified, where applicable under Article 19(1), has not passed.
3.   Where distributors consider or have reason to believe that:
—
a cosmetic product is not in conformity with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall not make the product available on the market until it has been brought into conformity with the applicable requirements,
—
a cosmetic product which they have made available on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation, they shall make sure that the corrective measures necessary to bring that product into conformity, withdraw it or recall it, as appropriate, are taken.
Furthermore, where the cosmetic product presents a risk to human health, distributors shall immediately inform the responsible person and the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the product available, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of the corrective measures taken.
4.   Distributors shall ensure that, while a product is under their responsibility, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the requirements set out in this Regulation.
5.   Distributors shall cooperate with competent authorities, at the request of the latter, on any action to eliminate the risks posed by products which they have made available on the market. In particular, distributors shall, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product with the requirements listed under paragraph 2, in a language which can be easily understood by that authority.
