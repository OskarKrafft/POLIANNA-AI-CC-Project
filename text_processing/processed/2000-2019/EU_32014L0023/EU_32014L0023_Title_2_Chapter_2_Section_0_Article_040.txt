Article 40
Provision of information to candidates and tenderers
1.   The contracting authority or contracting entity shall as soon as possible inform each candidate and tenderer of decisions taken concerning the award of a concession, including the name of the successful tenderer, the grounds for any decision to reject his application or tender and the grounds for any decision not to award a contract for which there has been publication of a concession notice or to recommence the procedure.
Moreover, on request from the party concerned, the contracting authority or contracting entity shall as quickly as possible, and in any case within 15 days from receipt of a written request inform any tenderers that have made an admissible tender of the characteristics and relative advantages of the tender selected.
2.   The contracting authority or contracting entity may decide to withhold certain information referred to in paragraph 1, regarding the contract, where the release of such information would impede law enforcement, would otherwise be contrary to the public interest, would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of economic operators, whether public or private, or might prejudice fair competition between such operators.
