Article 1
Subject-matter and scope
1.   This Directive establishes rules on the procedures for procurement by contracting authorities and contracting entities by means of a concession, whose value is estimated to be not less than the threshold laid down in Article 8.
2.   This Directive applies to the award of works or services concessions, to economic operators by:
(a)
Contracting authorities; or
(b)
Contracting entities, provided that the works or services are intended for the pursuit of one of the activities referred to in Annex II.
3.   The application of this Directive is subject to Article 346 TFEU.
4.   Agreements, decisions or other legal instruments that organise the transfer of powers and responsibilities for the performance of public tasks between contracting authorities or contracting entities or groupings of contracting authorities or contracting entities, and which do not provide for remuneration to be given for contractual performance, are considered to be a matter of internal organisation of the Member State concerned and, as such, are not affected in any way by this Directive.
