Article 4
Freedom to define services of general economic interest
1.   This Directive does not affect the freedom of Member States to define, in conformity with Union law, what they consider to be services of general economic interest, how those services should be organised and financed, in compliance with the State aid rules, and what specific obligations they should be subject to. Equally, this Directive does not affect the way in which the Member States organise their social security systems.
2.   Non-economic services of general interest shall fall outside the scope of this Directive.
