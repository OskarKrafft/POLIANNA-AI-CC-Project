Article 34
Electronic availability of concession documents
1.   Contracting authorities and contracting entities shall offer by electronic means unrestricted and full direct access free of charge to the concession documents from the date of publication of a concession notice or, where the concession notice does not include the invitation to submit tenders, from the date on which an invitation to submit tenders was sent. The text of the concession notice or of these invitations shall specify the internet address at which the concession documents are accessible.
2.   Where, in duly justified circumstances, due to exceptional security, or technical reasons or due to the particularly sensitive nature of commercial information requiring a very high level of protection, unrestricted and full direct access free of charge by electronic means to certain concession documents cannot be offered, contracting authorities or contracting entities shall indicate in the notice or the invitation to submit a tender that the concession documents concerned will be transmitted by other means than electronic means and the time limit for the receipt of tenders shall be prolonged.
3.   Provided that it has been requested in good time, the contracting authorities and contracting entities or competent departments shall supply to all applicants or tenderers taking part in the concession award procedure additional information relating to the concession documents not later than six days before the deadline fixed for the receipt of tenders.
