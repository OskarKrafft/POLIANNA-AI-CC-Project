Article 2
Principle of free administration by public authorities
1.   This Directive recognises the principle of free administration by national, regional and local authorities in conformity with national and Union law. Those authorities are free to decide how best to manage the execution of works or the provision of services, to ensure in particular a high level of quality, safety and affordability, equal treatment and the promotion of universal access and of user rights in public services.
Those authorities may choose to perform their public interest tasks with their own resources, or in cooperation with other authorities or to confer them upon economic operators.
2.   This Directive does not affect Member States’ systems of property ownership. In particular it does not require the privatisation of public enterprises providing services to the public.
