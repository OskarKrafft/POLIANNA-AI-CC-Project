Article 53
Monitoring and reporting
The Commission shall assess the economic effects on the internal market, in particular in terms of factors such as cross-border award of contracts and transaction costs, resulting from the application of the thresholds set out in Article 8, and report thereon to the European Parliament and the Council by 18 April 2019. The appropriateness of the level of thresholds shall be examined in the context of negotiations under the GPA taking into account the impact of inflation and transaction costs. The Commission shall, where possible and appropriate, consider suggesting an increase of the threshold amounts applicable under the GPA during the next round of negotiations.
In the event of any change to the threshold amounts applicable under the GPA, the report shall, where appropriate, be followed by a legislative proposal amending the thresholds set out in this Directive.
The Commission shall also assess the economic effects on the internal market of the exclusions set out in Article 12 taking into account the specific structures of the water sector, and report thereon to the European Parliament and the Council by 18 April 2019.
The Commission shall review the functioning of this Directive and shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 18 April 2021, and every five years thereafter, based on information that Member States shall provide in accordance with Article 45(3).
The Commission shall make the results of the review carried out in accordance with the fourth paragraph publicly available.
