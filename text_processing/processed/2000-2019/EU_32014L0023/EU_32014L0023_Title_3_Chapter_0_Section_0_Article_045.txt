Article 45
Monitoring and reporting
1.   In order to ensure correct and efficient implementation, Member States shall ensure that at least the tasks set out in this Article are performed by one or more authorities or structures. They shall indicate to the Commission all authorities, or structures competent for these tasks.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the application of rules for the award of concession contracts is monitored. Where monitoring authorities or structures identify specific violations, such as fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and other serious irregularities, or systemic problems, they shall be empowered to indicate those violations or problems to national auditing authorities, courts or tribunals or other appropriate authorities or structures, such as the ombudsman, national parliaments or committees thereof.
3.   The results of the monitoring activities pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be made available to the public through appropriate means of information.
The Commission may, at the most every three years, request that Member States transmit to the Commission a monitoring report covering an overview of the most frequent causes of incorrect application of the rules for the award of concession contracts, including possible structural or recurring problems in the application of the rules, including possible cases of fraud and other illegal behaviour.
4.   Member States shall ensure that information and guidance on the interpretation and application of Union law for the award of concession contracts is available free of charge to assist contracting authorities and entities and economic operators in correctly applying the Union rules.
