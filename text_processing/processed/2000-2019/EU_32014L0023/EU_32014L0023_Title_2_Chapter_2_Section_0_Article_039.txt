Article 39
Time limits for receipt of applications and tenders for the concession
1.   When fixing the time limits for the receipt of applications or of tenders contracting authorities or contracting entities shall take account in particular of the complexity of the concession and the time required for drawing up tenders or applications without prejudice to the minimum time limits set out in this Article.
2.   Where applications or tenders can be made only after a visit to the site or after on-the-spot inspection of the documents supporting the concession award documents, the time limits for the receipt of applications for the concession or for the receipt of tenders, shall be fixed so that all economic operators concerned may be aware of all the information needed to produce applications or tenders and, in any event, shall be longer than the minimum time limits set out in paragraphs 3 and 4.
3.   The minimum time limit for the receipt of applications whether or not including tenders for the concession shall be 30 days from the date on which the concession notice was sent.
4.   Where the procedure takes place in successive stages the minimum time limit for the receipt of initial tenders shall be 22 days from the date on which the invitation to tender is sent.
5.   The time limit for receipt of tenders may be reduced by five days where the contracting authority or contracting entity accepts that tenders may be submitted by electronic means in conformity with Article 29.
