2.   At trade fairs, exhibitions and similar events, Member States shall not create any obstacles to the display of radio equipment which does not comply with this Directive, provided that a visible sign clearly indicates that such radio equipment may not be made available on the market or put into service until it has been brought into conformity with this Directive.
