2.   The inscriptions referred to in Annex IV, point 2, shall be affixed in a clearly visible, easily legible and indelible form to all other instruments.
3.   The affixing on the instruments of markings which are likely to deceive third parties as to the meaning and form of the ‘CE’ conformity marking shall be prohibited.
