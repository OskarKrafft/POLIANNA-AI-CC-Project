1.   The PEPP Benefit Statement shall specify where and how to obtain supplementary information including:
(a)
further practical information about the PEPP saver’s rights and options, including with regard to investments, the decumulation phase, the switching service and the portability service;
(b)
the annual accounts and annual reports of the PEPP provider that are publicly available;
(c)
a written statement of the PEPP provider’s investment-policy principles, containing at least information on the investment risk measurement methods, the risk-management processes implemented and the strategic asset allocation with respect to the nature and duration of PEPP liabilities, as well as how the investment policy takes ESG factors into account;
(d)
where applicable, information about the assumptions used for amounts expressed in annuities, in particular with respect to the annuity rate, the type of PEPP provider and the duration of the annuity;
(e)
the level of PEPP benefits, in the case of redemption before the date referred to in point (a) of Article 36(1).
2.   In order to ensure consistent application of Article 36 and of this Article, EIOPA shall, after consulting the other ESAs and after conducting consumer testing and industry testing, develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the details of the presentation of the information referred to in Article 36 and in this Article. In relation to the presentation of the information on past performance as referred to in point (j) of Article 36(1), the differences between the investment options shall be taken into account, in particular if the PEPP saver bears investment risk or if the investment option is age-dependent or includes duration matching.
EIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 15 August 2020.
Power is conferred on the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.
3.   Without prejudice to Article 34(2) and point (d) of Article 36(1), in order to allow for comparison with national products, Member States may require PEPP providers to provide PEPP savers with additional pension benefit projections where the rules to determine the assumptions are set by the respective Member States.
