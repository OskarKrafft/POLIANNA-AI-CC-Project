Article 60
Retirement planning and advice on out-payments
1.   For the Basic PEPP, at the start of the decumulation phase, the PEPP provider shall offer the PEPP saver personal retirement planning on the sustainable use of the capital accumulated in the PEPP sub-accounts, taking into account at least:
(a)
the value of the capital accumulated in the PEPP sub-accounts;
(b)
the total amount of other accrued retirement entitlements; and
(c)
the long-term retirement-related demands and needs of the PEPP saver.
2.   The retirement planning referred to in paragraph 1 shall include a personal recommendation to the PEPP saver on his or her optimal form of out-payments unless only one form of out-payments is provided. If a lump-sum payment is not in line with the retirement-related needs of the PEPP saver, the advice shall be accompanied by a warning to that end.
