Article 33
Provision of the PEPP KID
1.   A PEPP provider or PEPP distributor shall provide prospective PEPP savers with all the PEPP KIDs drawn up in accordance with Article 26 when advising on, or offering for sale, a PEPP, in good time before those PEPP savers are bound by any PEPP contract or offer relating to that PEPP contract.
2.   A PEPP provider or PEPP distributor may satisfy the requirements of paragraph 1 by providing the PEPP KID to a natural person with written authority to make investment decisions on behalf of the PEPP saver in respect of transactions concluded under that written authority.
3.   In order to ensure consistent application of this Article, EIOPA shall, after having consulted the other ESAs where appropriate, develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the conditions for fulfilling the requirement to provide the PEPP KID as laid down in paragraph 1.
EIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 15 August 2020.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.
