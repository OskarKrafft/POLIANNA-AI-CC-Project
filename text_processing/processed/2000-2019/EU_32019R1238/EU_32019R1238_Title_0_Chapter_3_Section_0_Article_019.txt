Article 19
Sub-accounts of the PEPP
1.   Where PEPP providers provide a portability service to PEPP savers in accordance with Article 17, PEPP providers shall ensure that when a new sub-account is opened within a PEPP account, it shall correspond to the legal requirements and conditions, as referred to in Articles 47 and 57, determined at national level for the PEPP by the new Member State of residence of the PEPP saver. All transactions in the PEPP account shall be entered into a corresponding sub-account. The contributions made to and withdrawals from the sub-account may be subject to separate contract terms.
2.   Without prejudice to applicable sectorial law, PEPP providers may also ensure compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 by establishing a partnership with another registered PEPP provider (the ‘partner’).
Having regard to the scope of the functions to be carried out by the partner, the partner shall be qualified and capable of undertaking the delegated functions. The PEPP provider shall enter into a written agreement with the partner. The agreement shall be legally enforceable and shall clearly define the rights and obligations of the PEPP provider and of the partner. The agreement shall comply with the relevant rules and procedures for delegation and outsourcing established by or under the Union law applicable to them, as referred to in Article 6(1). Notwithstanding that agreement, the PEPP provider shall remain solely liable for its responsibilities under this Regulation.
