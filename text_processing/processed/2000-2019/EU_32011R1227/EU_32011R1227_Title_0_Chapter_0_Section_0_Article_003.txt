disclosing that information to any other person unless such disclosure is made in the normal course of the exercise of their employment, profession or duties;
(c)
recommending or inducing another person, on the basis of inside information, to acquire or dispose of wholesale energy products to which that information relates.

(a)
members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of an undertaking;
(b)
persons with holdings in the capital of an undertaking;
(c)

4.   This Article shall not apply to:

(b)
transactions entered into by electricity and natural gas producers, operators of natural gas storage facilities or operators of LNG import facilities the sole purpose of which is to cover the immediate physical loss resulting from unplanned outages, where not to do so would result in the market participant not being able to meet existing contractual obligations or where such action is undertaken in agreement with the transmission system operator(s) concerned in order to ensure safe and secure operation of the system.

6.   When information is disseminated for the purposes of journalism or artistic expression such dissemination of information shall be assessed taking into account the rules governing the freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media, unless:
(a)
those persons derive, directly or indirectly, an advantage or profits from the dissemination of the information in question; or
(b)
the disclosure or dissemination is made with the intention of misleading the market as to the supply of, demand for, or price of wholesale energy products.
