Article 49
Specialised infrastructure
1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, infrastructure capacity shall be considered to be available for the use of all types of service which conform to the characteristics necessary for operation on the train path.
2.   Where there are suitable alternative routes, the infrastructure manager may, after consultation with interested parties, designate particular infrastructure for use by specified types of traffic. Without prejudice to Articles 101, 102 and 106 TFEU, where such designation has occurred, the infrastructure manager may give priority to this type of traffic when allocating infrastructure capacity.
Such designation shall not prevent the use of such infrastructure by other types of traffic when capacity is available.
