Article 54
Special measures to be taken in the event of disturbance
1.   In the event of disturbance to train movements caused by technical failure or accident the infrastructure manager shall take all necessary steps to restore the situation to normal. To that end, it shall draw up a contingency plan listing the various bodies to be informed in the event of serious incidents or serious disturbance to train movements.
2.   In an emergency and, where absolutely necessary, on account of a breakdown making the infrastructure temporarily unusable, the train paths allocated may be withdrawn without warning for as long as is necessary to repair the system.
The infrastructure manager may, if it deems this necessary, require railway undertakings to make available to it the resources which it feels are the most appropriate to restore the situation to normal as soon as possible.
3.   Member States may require railway undertakings to be involved in assuring the enforcement and monitoring of their own compliance with the safety standards and rules.
