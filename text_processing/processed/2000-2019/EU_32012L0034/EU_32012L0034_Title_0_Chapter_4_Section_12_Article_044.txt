Article 44
Applications
1.   Applicants may apply under public or private law to the infrastructure manager to request an agreement granting rights to use railway infrastructure against a charge as provided for in Section 2 of Chapter IV.
2.   Requests relating to the regular working timetable shall comply with the deadlines set out in Annex VII.
3.   An applicant who is a party to a framework agreement shall apply in accordance with that agreement.
4.   For train paths crossing more than one network, infrastructure managers shall ensure that applicants may apply to a one-stop shop that is either a joint body established by the infrastructure managers or one single infrastructure manager involved in the train path. That infrastructure manager shall be permitted to act on behalf of the applicant to seek capacity with other relevant infrastructure managers. This requirement is without prejudice to Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2010 concerning a European rail network for competitive freight (16).
