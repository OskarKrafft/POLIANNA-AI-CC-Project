Article 50
Capacity analysis
1.   The objective of capacity analysis is to determine the constraints on infrastructure capacity which prevent requests for capacity from being adequately met, and to propose methods of enabling additional requests to be satisfied. The capacity analysis shall identify the reasons for the congestion and what measures might be taken in the short and medium term to ease the congestion.
2.   The capacity analysis shall consider the infrastructure, the operating procedures, the nature of the different services operating and the effect of all these factors on infrastructure capacity. Measures to be considered shall include in particular rerouting services, retiming services, speed alterations and infrastructure improvements.
3.   A capacity analysis shall be completed within six months of the identification of infrastructure as congested.
