Article 17
General requirements
1.   An undertaking shall be entitled to apply for a licence in the Member State in which it is established.
2.   Member States shall not issue licences or extend their validity where the requirements of this Chapter are not complied with.
3.   An undertaking which fulfils the requirements set out in this Chapter shall be authorised to receive a licence.
4.   No undertaking shall be permitted to provide the rail transport services covered by this Chapter unless it has been granted the appropriate licence for the services to be provided.
However, such a licence shall not, in itself, entitle the holder to access the railway infrastructure.
5.   The Commission shall adopt measures setting out the details for the use of a common template for the licence and, if needed to ensure fair and efficient competition in rail transport markets, details on the procedure to be followed for the application of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(3).
