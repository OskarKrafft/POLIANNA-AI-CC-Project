Article 19
1.   Television advertising and teleshopping shall be readily recognisable and distinguishable from editorial content. Without prejudice to the use of new advertising techniques, television advertising and teleshopping shall be kept quite distinct from other parts of the programme by optical and/or acoustic and/or spatial means.
2.   Isolated advertising and teleshopping spots, other than in transmissions of sports events, shall remain the exception.
