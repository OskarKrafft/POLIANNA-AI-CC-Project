Article 19
Products presenting a serious risk
1.   Market surveillance authorities shall ensure that products presenting a serious risk are withdrawn or recalled, where there is no other effective means available to eliminate the serious risk, or that their being made available on the market is prohibited. Market surveillance authorities shall notify the Commission thereof immediately, in accordance with Article 20.
2.   A decision whether or not a product presents a serious risk shall be based on an appropriate risk assessment that takes account of the nature of the hazard and the likelihood of its occurrence. The feasibility of obtaining higher levels of safety and the availability of other products presenting a lesser degree of risk shall not constitute grounds for considering that a product presents a serious risk.
