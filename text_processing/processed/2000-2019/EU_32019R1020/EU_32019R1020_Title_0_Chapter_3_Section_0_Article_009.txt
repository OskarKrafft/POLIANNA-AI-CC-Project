Article 9
Joint activities to promote compliance
1.   Market surveillance authorities may agree with other relevant authorities or with organisations representing economic operators or end users on the carrying out of joint activities that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to the Union harmonisation legislation with respect to specific categories of products, in particular categories of products that are often found to present a serious risk, including products offered for sale online.
2.   The market surveillance authority in question and the parties referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that the agreement on joint activities does not lead to unfair competition between economic operators and does not affect the objectivity, independence and impartiality of the parties.
3.   A market surveillance authority may use any information resulting from joint activities carried out as part of any investigation regarding non-compliance that it undertakes.
4.   The market surveillance authority in question shall make the agreement on joint activities, including the names of the parties involved, available to the public and shall enter that agreement in the information and communication system referred to in Article 34. At the request of a Member State, the Network established under Article 29 shall assist in the drawing up of the agreement on joint activities.
