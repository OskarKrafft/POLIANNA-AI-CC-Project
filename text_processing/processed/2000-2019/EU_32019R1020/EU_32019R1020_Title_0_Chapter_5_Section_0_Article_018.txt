Article 18
Procedural rights of economic operators
1.   Any measure, decision or order taken or made by market surveillance authorities pursuant to Union harmonisation legislation or this Regulation shall state the exact grounds on which it is based.
2.   Any such measure, decision or order shall be communicated without delay to the relevant economic operator, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to it under the law of the Member State concerned and of the time limits to which those remedies are subject.
3.   Before a measure, decision or order referred to in paragraph 1 is taken or made, the economic operator concerned shall be given the opportunity to be heard within an appropriate period of not less than 10 working days, unless it is not possible to give the economic operator that opportunity because of the urgency of the measure, decision or order, based on health or safety requirements or other grounds relating to the public interests covered by the relevant Union harmonisation legislation.
If the measure, decision or order is taken or made without the economic operator being given the opportunity to be heard, the economic operator shall be given that opportunity as soon as possible thereafter and that measure, decision or order shall be reviewed promptly by the market surveillance authority.
