Article 23
Requests for enforcement measures
1.   Where bringing non-compliance with regard to a product to an end requires measures within the jurisdiction of another Member State and where such measures do not result from the requirements of Article 16(7), an applicant authority may submit a duly reasoned request for enforcement measures to a requested authority in that other Member State.
2.   The requested authority shall without delay take all appropriate and necessary enforcement measures using the powers conferred on it under this Regulation in order to bring the instance of non-compliance to an end by exercising the powers laid down in Article 14 and any additional powers granted to it under national law.
3.   The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority about the measures referred to in paragraph 2 that have been taken or which are intended to be taken.
A requested authority may refuse to comply with a request for enforcement measures in any of the following situations:
(a)
the requested authority concludes that the applicant authority has not provided sufficient information;
(b)
the requested authority considers that the request is contrary to Union harmonisation legislation;
(c)
the requested authority demonstrates reasonable grounds showing that complying with the request would substantially impair the execution of its own activities.
