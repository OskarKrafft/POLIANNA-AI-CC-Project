Article 20
Rapid Information Exchange System
1.   Where a market surveillance authority takes or intends to take a measure pursuant to Article 19 and considers that the reasons which prompted the measure or the effects of the measure go beyond the territory of its Member State, it shall immediately notify the Commission of that measure in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article. The market surveillance authority shall also inform the Commission without delay of the modification or withdrawal of any such measure.
2.   If a product presenting a serious risk has been made available on the market, market surveillance authorities shall immediately notify the Commission of any voluntary measures taken and communicated to the market surveillance authority by an economic operator.
3.   The information provided in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the product, the origin and the supply chain of the product, the risk related to the product, the nature and the duration of the national measure taken and any voluntary measures taken by economic operators.
4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the Rapid Information Exchange System (RAPEX) provided for in Article 12 of Directive 2001/95/EC shall be used. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 12 of that Directive shall apply mutatis mutandis.
5.   The Commission shall provide and maintain a data interface between RAPEX and the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 so as to avoid double data entry.
