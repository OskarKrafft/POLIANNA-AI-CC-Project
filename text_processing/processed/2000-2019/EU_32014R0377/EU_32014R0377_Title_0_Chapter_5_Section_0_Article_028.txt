2.   The terms and conditions relating to the transfer of ownership to the Union shall be laid down in the agreements referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   The Commission shall ensure, through an appropriate framework, the optimal use of the assets referred to in this Article; in particular, it shall manage the intellectual property rights relating to Copernicus as effectively as possible, taking into account the need to protect and give value to the Union's intellectual property rights, the interests of all stakeholders, and the necessity of harmonious development of the markets and of new technologies and the continuity of services. To that end, it shall ensure that the contracts entered into, under Copernicus, include the possibility of transferring or licensing intellectual property rights arising from work performed under Copernicus.
