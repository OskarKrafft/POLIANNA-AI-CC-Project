Article 22
Subcontracting
1.   The contracting authority shall request the tenderer to subcontract a share of the contract by competitive tendering at the appropriate levels of sub-contracting to companies other than those that belong to the tenderer's group in particular to new entrants and SMEs.
2.   The contracting authority shall express the requisite share of the contract to be sub-contracted in the form of a range from a minimum to a maximum percentage. It shall ensure that such percentages are proportionate to the objective and value of the contract, taking into account the nature of the sector of activity concerned, and in particular, the competitive conditions and industrial potential observed.
3.   If the tenderer indicates in its tender that it intends not to sub-contract any share of the contract or to subcontract a share inferior to the minimum of the range referred to in paragraph 2, it shall provide the reasons therefor to the contracting authority. The contracting authority shall submit that information to the Commission.
4.   The contracting authority may reject subcontractors selected by the candidate at the stage of the main contract award procedure or by the tenderer selected for the performance of the contract. It shall justify this rejection in writing, which may be based only on the criteria used for selection of tenderers for the main contract.
