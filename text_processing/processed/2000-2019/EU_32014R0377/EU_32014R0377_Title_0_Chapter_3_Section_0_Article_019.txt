Article 19
Conditional stage-payment contract
1.   The contracting authority may award a contract in the form of a conditional stage-payment contract.
2.   A conditional stage-payment contract shall include a fixed stage which is accompanied by a budgetary commitment which results in a firm commitment to provide the works, supplies or services contracted for that stage and one or more stages which are conditional in terms of both budget and execution. The tender documents shall refer to the specific features of conditional stage-payment contracts. In particular, they shall specify the subject-matter of the contract, the price or the arrangements for determining the price and the arrangements for the provision of works, supplies and services at each stage.
3.   The fixed stage obligations shall be part of a consistent whole; the same shall be true for the obligations under each conditional stage, taking into account the obligations under the previous stages.
4.   Performance of each conditional stage shall be subject to a decision by the contracting authority, notified to the contractor in accordance with the contract. When a conditional stage is confirmed late or is not confirmed, the contractor may benefit, if the contract so provides and under the conditions laid down therein, from a tide-over allowance or a non-execution allowance.
5.   Where, with regard to a particular stage, the contracting authority finds that works, supplies, or services agreed for that stage have not been completed, it may claim damages and terminate the contract, if the contract so provides and under the conditions laid down therein.
