Article 33
Monitoring by the Commission
1.   The Commission shall monitor the origin of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels consumed in the Union and the impact of their production, including the impact as a result of displacement, on land use in the Union and in the main third countries of supply. Such monitoring shall be based on Member States' integrated national energy and climate plans and corresponding progress reports pursuant to Articles 3, 17 and 20 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and those of relevant third countries, intergovernmental organisations, scientific studies and any other relevant pieces of information. The Commission shall also monitor the commodity price changes associated with the use of biomass for energy and any associated positive and negative effects on food security.
2.   The Commission shall maintain a dialogue and exchange information with third countries and biofuel, bioliquid and biomass fuel producers, consumer organisations and civil society concerning the general implementation of the measures in this Directive relating to biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. It shall, within that framework, pay particular attention to the impact that biofuel, bioliquid and biomass fuel production may have on food prices.
3.   In 2026, the Commission shall submit, if appropriate, a legislative proposal on the regulatory framework for the promotion of energy from renewable sources for the period after 2030.
That proposal shall take into account the experience of the implementation of this Directive, including its sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria, and technological developments in energy from renewable sources.
4.   In 2032, the Commission shall publish a report reviewing the application of this Directive.
