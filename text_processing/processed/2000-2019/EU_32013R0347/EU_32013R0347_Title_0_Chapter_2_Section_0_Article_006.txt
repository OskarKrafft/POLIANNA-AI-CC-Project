1.   Where a project of common interest encounters significant implementation difficulties, the Commission may designate, in agreement with the Member States concerned, a European coordinator for a period of up to one year renewable twice.
2.   The European coordinator shall:
(a)
promote the projects, for which he has been designated European coordinator and the cross-border dialogue between the project promoters and all concerned stakeholders;
(b)
assist all parties as necessary in consulting concerned stakeholders and obtaining necessary permits for the projects;
(c)
if appropriate, advise project promoters on the financing of the project;
(d)
ensure that appropriate support and strategic direction by the Member States concerned are provided for the preparation and implementation of the projects;
(e)
submit every year, and if appropriate, upon completion of their mandate, a report to the Commission on the progress of the projects and on any difficulties and obstacles which are likely to significantly delay the commissioning date of the projects. The Commission shall transmit the report to the European Parliament and the Groups concerned.
3.   The European coordinator shall be chosen on the basis of his experience with regard to the specific tasks assigned to him for the projects concerned.
4.   The decision designating the European coordinator shall specify the terms of reference, detailing the duration of the mandate, the specific tasks and corresponding deadlines, and the methodology to be followed. The coordination effort shall be proportionate to the complexity and estimated costs of the projects.
