Article 14
Eligibility of projects for Union financial assistance
1.   Projects of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1, 2 and 4 are eligible for Union financial assistance in the form of grants for studies and financial instruments.
2.   Projects of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1(a) to (d) and Annex II.2, except for hydro-pumped electricity storage projects, are also eligible for Union financial assistance in the form of grants for works if they fulfil all of the following criteria:
(a)
the project specific cost-benefit analysis pursuant to Article 12(3)(a) provides evidence concerning the existence of significant positive externalities, such as security of supply, solidarity or innovation;
(b)
the project has received a cross-border cost allocation decision pursuant to Article 12; or, for projects of common interest falling under the category set out in Annex II.1(c) and that therefore do not receive a cross-border cost allocation decision, the project shall aim to provide services across borders, bring technological innovation and ensure the safety of cross-border grid operation;
(c)
the project is commercially not viable according to the business plan and other assessments carried out, notably by possible investors or creditors or the national regulatory authority. The decision on incentives and its justification referred to in Article 13(2) shall be taken into account when assessing the project’s commercial viability.
3.   Projects of common interest carried out in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(7)(d) shall also be eligible for Union financial assistance in the form of grants for works if they fulfil the criteria set out in paragraph 2 of this Article.
4.   Projects of common interest falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1(e) and 4 shall be also eligible for Union financial assistance in the form of grants for works, if the concerned project promoters can clearly demonstrate the significant positive externalities generated by the projects and their lack of commercial viability, according to the business plan and other assessments carried out, notably by possible investors or creditors or, where applicable, a national regulatory authority.
