Article 13
Financing in respect of WEEE from users other than private households
1.   Member States shall ensure that the financing of the costs for the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from users other than private households resulting from products placed on the market after 13 August 2005 is to be provided for by producers.
For historical waste being replaced by new equivalent products or by new products fulfilling the same function, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by producers of those products when supplying them. Member States may, as an alternative, provide that users other than private households also be made, partly or totally, responsible for this financing.
For other historical waste, the financing of the costs shall be provided for by the users other than private households.
2.   Producers and users other than private households may, without prejudice to this Directive, conclude agreements stipulating other financing methods.
