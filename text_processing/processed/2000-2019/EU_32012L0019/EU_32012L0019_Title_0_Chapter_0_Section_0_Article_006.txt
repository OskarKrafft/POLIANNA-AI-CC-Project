Article 6
Disposal and transport of collected WEEE
1.   Member States shall prohibit the disposal of separately collected WEEE which has not yet undergone the treatment specified in Article 8.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the collection and transport of separately collected WEEE is carried out in a way which allows optimal conditions for preparing for re-use, recycling and the confinement of hazardous substances.
In order to maximise preparing for re-use, Member States shall promote that, prior to any further transfer, collection schemes or facilities provide, where appropriate, for the separation at the collection points of WEEE that is to be prepared for re-use from other separately collected WEEE, in particular by granting access for personnel from re-use centres.
