Article 9
1.   Managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds shall identify and avoid conflicts of interest and, where they cannot be avoided, manage and monitor and, in accordance with paragraph 4, disclose those conflicts of interest promptly in order to prevent them from adversely affecting the interests of the qualifying social entrepreneurship funds and the investors therein and to ensure that the qualifying social entrepreneurship funds that they manage are fairly treated.
2.   Managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds shall identify in particular those conflicts of interest that may arise between:
(a)
managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds, persons who effectively conduct the business of those managers, employees of, or any person who directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by, those managers, and the qualifying social entrepreneurship fund managed by those managers, or the investors therein;
(b)
a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund or the investors therein, and another qualifying social entrepreneurship fund managed by the same manager, or the investors therein;
(c)
the qualifying social entrepreneurship fund or the investors therein, and a collective investment undertaking or UCITS managed by the same manager, or the investors therein.
3.   Managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds shall maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements in order to comply with the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2.
4.   Disclosures of conflicts of interest as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be provided, where organisational arrangements made by a manager of a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund to identify, prevent, manage and monitor conflicts of interest are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that risks of damage to investors’ interests will be prevented. A manager of a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund shall disclose in clear terms the general nature or sources of conflicts of interest to the investors before undertaking business on their behalf.
5.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 26 specifying:
(a)
the types of conflicts of interest referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article;
(b)
the steps that managers of a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund must take, in terms of structures and organisational and administrative procedures, in order to identify, prevent, manage, monitor and disclose conflicts of interest.
