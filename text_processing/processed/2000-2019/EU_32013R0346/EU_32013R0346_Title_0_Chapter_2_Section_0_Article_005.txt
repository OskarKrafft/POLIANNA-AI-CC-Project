Article 5
1.   Managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds shall ensure that, when acquiring assets other than qualifying investments, no more than 30 % of the qualifying social entrepreneurship fund’s aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital is used for the acquisition of such assets. The 30 % threshold shall be calculated on the basis of amounts investible after the deduction of all relevant costs. Holdings in cash and cash equivalents shall not be taken into account for calculating that threshold as cash and cash equivalents are not to be considered as investments.
2.   Managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds shall not employ at the level of the qualifying social entrepreneurship fund any method by which the exposure of the fund will be increased beyond the level of its committed capital, whether through borrowing of cash or securities, engaging in derivative positions or by any other means.
3.   Managers of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds may only borrow, issue debt obligations or provide guarantees, at the level of the qualifying social entrepreneurship fund where such borrowings, debt obligations or guarantees are covered by uncalled commitments.
