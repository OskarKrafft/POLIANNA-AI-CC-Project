the geographical and sectoral distribution of investments undertaken by qualifying social entrepreneurship funds;
(c)
the appropriateness of the information requirements under Article 14, in particular whether they are sufficient to enable investors to take an informed investment decision;

the use of the different qualifying investments by qualifying social entrepreneurship funds and what impact this has had on the development of social undertakings across the Union;
(e)
the appropriateness of establishing a European label for ‘social enterprises’;
(f)
the possibility of allowing social entrepreneurship funds established in a third country to use the designation ‘EuSEF’, taking into account experience in applying the Commission Recommendation regarding measures intended to encourage third countries to apply minimum standards of good governance in tax matters;

the practical application of the criteria for identifying qualifying portfolio undertakings, the impact of this on the development of social undertakings across the Union and their positive social impact;
(h)

(i)
the possibility of extending the marketing of qualifying social entrepreneurship funds to retail investors;
(j)
the appropriateness of including qualifying social entrepreneurship funds within eligible assets under Directive 2009/65/EC;
(k)
the appropriateness of complementing this Regulation with a depositary regime;
(l)
an examination of possible tax obstacles for social entrepreneurship funds and an assessment of possible tax incentives aimed at encouraging social entrepreneurship in the Union;
(m)
an evaluation of any barriers that may have impeded investment into funds using the designation ‘EuSEF’, including the impact on institutional investors of other Union law of a prudential nature.
2.   The review referred to in paragraph 1 shall be conducted:
(a)
by 22 July 2017 as regards points (a) to (e) and (g) to (m); and
