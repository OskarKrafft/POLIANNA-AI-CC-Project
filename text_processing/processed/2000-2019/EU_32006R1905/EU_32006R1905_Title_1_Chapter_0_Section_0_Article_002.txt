Article 2
Objectives
1.   The primary and overarching objective of cooperation under this Regulation shall be the eradication of poverty in partner countries and regions in the context of sustainable development, including pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as well as the promotion of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights and for the rule of law. Consistently with this objective, cooperation with partner countries and regions shall:
—
consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, good governance, gender equality and related instruments of international law;
—
foster the sustainable development — including political, economic, social and environmental aspects — of partner countries and regions, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them;
—
encourage their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy;
—
help develop international measures to preserve and improve the quality of the environment and the sustainable management of global natural resources, in order to ensure sustainable development, including addressing climate change and biodiversity loss; and
—
strengthen the relationship between the Community and partner countries and regions.
2.   Community cooperation under this Regulation shall comply with the commitments and objectives in the field of development cooperation that the Community has approved in the context of the United Nations (UN) and other competent international organisations in the field of development cooperation.
3.   Community development policy, as laid down in Title XX of the Treaty, shall provide the legal framework for cooperation with partner countries and regions. The Joint Statement by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on European Union Development Policy: ‘The European Consensus’, of 20 December 2005, and any subsequent modifications thereto, shall provide the general framework, orientations and focus to steer the implementation of Community cooperation with partner countries and regions under this Regulation.
4.   Measures referred to in Article 1(1) shall be designed so as to fulfil the criteria for Official Development Assistance (ODA) established by the OECD/DAC.
Programmes referred to in Article 1(2) shall be designed so as to fulfil the criteria for ODA established by the OECD/DAC, unless:
—
the characteristics of the beneficiary require otherwise, or
—
the programme implements a global initiative, a community policy priority or an international obligation or commitment of the Community, as referred to in Article 11(2), and the measure does not have the characteristics to fulfil such criteria.
At least 90 % of the expenditure foreseen under thematic programmes shall be designed so as to fulfil the criteria for ODA established by the OECD/DAC, without prejudice to Article 2(4), second subparagraph, first indent.
5.   Community assistance under this Regulation shall not be used to finance the procurement of arms or ammunition, and operations having military or defence implications.
6.   Measures covered by Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 and in particular Article 4 thereof, and eligible for funding thereunder shall not, in principle, be funded under this Regulation, except where there is a need to ensure continuity of cooperation from crisis to stable conditions for development.
Without prejudice to the need to ensure continuity of cooperation from crisis to stable conditions for development, measures covered by, and eligible for funding under, Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96, shall not be funded under this Regulation.
