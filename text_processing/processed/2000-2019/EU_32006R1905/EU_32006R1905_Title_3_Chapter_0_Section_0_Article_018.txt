Article 18
General framework for programming and allocating funds
1.   In the case of geographic programmes, the Commission shall draw up a strategy paper and a multiannual indicative programme for each partner country or region, as provided for in Article 19, and adopt an annual action programme for each partner country or region, as provided for in Article 22.
In the case of thematic programmes, the Commission shall draw up thematic strategy papers as provided for in Article 20, and adopt action programmes as provided for in Article 22.
In exceptional circumstances, Community support may also take the form of special measures not covered in strategy papers or multiannual indicative programmes, as provided for in Article 23.
2.   The Commission shall determine the multiannual indicative allocations within each geographic programme using standard, objective and transparent resource allocation criteria, based on the needs and performance of the partner country or region concerned and bearing in mind the particular difficulties faced by countries or regions in crisis, conflict or disaster prone, alongside the specificity of the different programmes.
The needs criteria include population, income per capita and the extent of poverty, income distribution and the level of social development. The performance criteria include political, economic and social progress, progress in good governance and the effective use of aid, and in particular the way a country uses scarce resources for development, beginning with its own resources.
3.   The Commission may include a specific financial allocation for the purpose of strengthening cooperation between the EU's outermost regions and neighbouring partner countries and regions.
