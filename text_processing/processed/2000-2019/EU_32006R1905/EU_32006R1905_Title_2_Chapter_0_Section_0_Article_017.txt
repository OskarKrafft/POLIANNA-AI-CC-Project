Article 17
ACP Sugar Protocol countries
1.   ACP Sugar Protocol countries listed in Annex III affected by the Community sugar reform shall benefit from a programme of accompanying measures. Community assistance to these countries shall aim at supporting their adjustment process as they are faced with new conditions on the sugar market due to the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar. Community assistance shall take into account the countries' adaptation strategies and shall pay specific attention to the following areas of cooperation:
(a)
enhancing the competitiveness of the sugar and cane sector, where this is a sustainable process, taking into account the situation of the different stakeholders in the chain;
(b)
promoting the economic diversification of sugar-dependent areas;
(c)
addressing broader impacts generated by the adaptation process, possibly related, but not restricted, to employment and social services, land use and environmental restoration, the energy sector, research and innovation and macro-economic stability.
2.   Within the amount referred to in Annex IV, the Commission shall fix the maximum amount available to each Sugar Protocol country for financing the actions referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of the needs of each country, related in particular to the impact of the reform of the sugar sector in the country concerned and to the importance of the sugar sector to the economy. The measurement of the allocation criteria shall be based on data of campaigns preceding 2004.
Further instructions regarding the allocation of the overall amount among beneficiaries shall be defined by the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 35(2).
