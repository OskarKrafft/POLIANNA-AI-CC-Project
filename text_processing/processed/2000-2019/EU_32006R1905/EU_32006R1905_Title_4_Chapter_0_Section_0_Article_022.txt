Article 22
Adoption of annual action programmes
1.   The Commission shall adopt annual action programmes based on the strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes referred to in Articles 19 and 20.
Exceptionally, for instance where an action programme has not yet been adopted, the Commission may, on the basis of the strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes referred to in Articles 19 and 20, adopt measures not provided for in an annual action programme under the same rules and procedures as for action programmes.
2.   Annual action programmes shall specify the objectives pursued, the fields of intervention, the expected results, the management procedures and total amount of financing planned. They shall contain a description of the operations to be financed, an indication of the amounts allocated for each operation and an indicative implementation timetable. Objectives shall be measurable and have time bound benchmarks.
3.   The annual action programmes shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 35(2).
4.   Appropriate environmental screening shall be undertaken at project level including environmental impact assessment (EIA) for environmentally sensitive projects, in particular for major new infrastructure. Where relevant, strategic environmental assessments (SEA) shall be used in the implementation of sectoral programmes. The involvement of interested stakeholders in environmental assessments and public access to the results shall be ensured.
