Article 11
Thematic programmes
1.   A thematic programme shall be subsidiary to programmes referred to in Articles 5 to 10 and shall encompass a specific area of activity of interest to a group of partner countries not determined by geography, or cooperation activities addressed to various regions or groups of partner countries, or an international operation that is not geographically specific.
2.   Consistently with the overall purpose and scope, objectives and general principles of this Regulation, the actions undertaken through thematic programmes shall add value to and be additional to, and coherent with, actions funded under geographic programmes. The following principles shall apply to these actions:
(a)
Community policy objectives cannot be achieved in an appropriate or effective manner through geographic programmes and the thematic programme is implemented by or through an intermediary organisation such as non-governmental organisations, other non-State actors, international organisations or multilateral mechanisms. This includes global initiatives supporting the MDGs, sustainable development or global public goods and actions in Member States and acceding countries by way of derogation from Article 24 as envisaged in the relevant thematic programme,
and/or
(b)
actions are of the following nature:
—
multi-regional and/or cross-cutting actions, including pilot projects and innovatory policies;
—
actions in cases where there is no agreement on the action with the partner government(s);
—
actions relevant to the purpose of a specific thematic programme which respond to a Community policy priority or an international obligation or commitment of the Community;
—
where appropriate, actions in cases where there is no geographic programme or it has been suspended.
