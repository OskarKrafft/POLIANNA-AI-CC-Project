Article 37
Suspension of assistance
Without prejudice to the provisions on suspension of aid in partnership and cooperation agreements with partner countries and regions, where a partner country fails to observe the principles referred to in Article 3(1), and where consultations with the partner country do not lead to a solution acceptable to both parties, or if consultations are refused or in cases of special urgency, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may take appropriate measures in respect of any assistance granted to the partner country under this Regulation. Such measures may include full or partial suspension of assistance.
