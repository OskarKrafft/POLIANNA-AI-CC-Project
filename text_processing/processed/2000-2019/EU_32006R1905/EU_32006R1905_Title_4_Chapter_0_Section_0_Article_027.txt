Article 27
Co-financing
1.   Measures shall be eligible for co-financing from the following, inter alia:
(a)
Member States and their regional and local authorities, and in particular their public and para-Statal agencies;
(b)
other donor countries, and in particular their public and para-Statal agencies;
(c)
international organisations, including regional organisations, and in particular international and regional financial institutions;
(d)
companies, firms, other private organisations and businesses, and other non-State actors;
(e)
partner countries and regions in receipt of funding.
2.   In the case of parallel co-financing, the project or programme is split into a number of clearly identifiable components, which are each financed by the different partners providing co-financing in such a way that the end-use of the financing can always be identified.
In the case of joint co-financing, the total cost of a project or programme is shared between the partners providing the co-financing and the resources are pooled in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify the source of financing for any given activity undertaken as part of the project or programme.
3.   In the case of joint co-financing, the Commission may receive and manage funds on behalf of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (c) for the purpose of implementing joint measures. Such funds shall be treated as assigned revenue, in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.
