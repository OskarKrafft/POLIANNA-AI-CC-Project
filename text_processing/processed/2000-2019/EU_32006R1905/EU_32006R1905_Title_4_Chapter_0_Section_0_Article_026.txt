Article 26
Support measures
1.   Community financing may cover expenditure associated with the preparation, follow up, monitoring, audit and evaluation activities directly necessary for the implementation of this Regulation and the achievement of its objectives, e.g. studies, meetings, information, awareness-raising, training and publication activities, expenditure associated with computer networks for the exchange of information, and any other administrative or technical assistance expenditure necessary for the management of the programme. It shall also cover expenditure at Commission delegations on the administrative support needed to manage operations financed under this Regulation.
2.   These support measures are not necessarily covered by multiannual indicative programmes and may therefore be financed outside the scope of strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes. However, they may also be financed under multiannual indicative programmes.
The Commission shall adopt support measures not covered by the multiannual indicative programmes in accordance with Article 23(3) and (4).
