Article 92
Inspections and withdrawal of authorisation
1.   The competent authority shall carry out inspections at least once per year, and sampling and testing if appropriate, to verify whether the authorised operators comply with Article 83(1), (2), (4) or (5), Article 87, Article 88, Article 89(1), Article 90 or Article 93(1), (2), (3) or (5).
2.   Where the competent authority becomes aware that an authorised operator does not comply with the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 or that a plant, plant product or other object, for which that professional operator has issued a plant passport, does not comply with Article 85 or, where applicable, Article 86, that authority shall without delay take the measures necessary to ensure that non-compliance with those provisions does not continue.
Those measures may include the withdrawal of the authorisation to issue plant passports for the plants, plant products and other objects concerned.
3.   Where the competent authority has taken measures in accordance with paragraph 2 other than the withdrawal of the authorisation to issue plant passports for the plants, plant products and other objects concerned, and non-compliance with Article 85 or, where applicable, Article 86 continues, that authority shall without delay withdraw that authorisation.
