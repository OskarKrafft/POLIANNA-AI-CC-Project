Article 95
Invalidation and removal of the plant passport
1.   The professional operator which has under its control a trade unit of plants, plant products or other objects shall invalidate the plant passport and, where possible, remove it from that trade unit where it becomes aware that any of the requirements of Articles 83 to 87, 89, 90, 93 or 94 are not fulfilled.
Without prejudice to the notification obligation referred to in Article 14, that professional operator shall inform the competent authority under the competence of which it operates.
2.   Where the professional operator fails to comply with paragraph 1, the competent authority shall invalidate the plant passport and, where possible, remove it from the trade unit concerned.
3.   Where paragraphs 1 and 2 apply, the professional operator concerned shall retain the invalidated plant passport or its content for at least three years.
That retention may take the form of storage of the information contained in the invalidated plant passport in a computerised database, provided that this includes the information contained in any traceability barcode, hologram, chip or other data carrier which may supplement the traceability code as referred to in Annex VII, and a statement concerning that invalidation.
4.   Where paragraphs 1 and 2 apply, the professional operator concerned shall inform accordingly the authorised operator, or competent authority, who issued the invalidated plant passport.
5.   Member States shall notify, through the electronic notification system referred to in Article 103, the Commission and other Member States where a plant passport was removed and invalidated pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article.
