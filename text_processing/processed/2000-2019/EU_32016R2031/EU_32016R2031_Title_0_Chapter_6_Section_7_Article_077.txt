Article 77
Invalidation of phytosanitary certificate
1.   Where a phytosanitary certificate has been issued in accordance with Article 71(1), (2) and (3), and the competent authority concerned concludes that the conditions referred to in Article 76 are not fulfilled, it shall invalidate that phytosanitary certificate and ensure that it no longer accompanies those plants, plant products or other objects concerned. In that case, and in respect of the plants, plant products or other objects concerned, the competent authority shall take one of the measures to be taken in the event of non-compliant consignments entering the Union from third countries, referred to in Union legislation on official controls.
Upon invalidation, the certificate concerned shall bear on its face and in a prominent position a triangular stamp in red, marked ‘certificate cancelled’ from the respective competent authority, together with its denomination and the date of invalidation. It shall be in capital letters, and in at least one of the official languages of the Union.
2.   Member States shall notify, through the electronic notification system referred to in Article 103, the Commission and other Member States where a phytosanitary certificate was invalidated pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.
The third country which had issued that phytosanitary certificate shall also be notified by the Member State concerned.
3.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, set out technical arrangements concerning the invalidation of the electronic phytosanitary certificates, as referred to in Article 76(5). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(2).
