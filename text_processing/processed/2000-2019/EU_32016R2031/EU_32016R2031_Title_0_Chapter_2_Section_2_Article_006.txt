Article 6
Priority pests
1.   Union quarantine pests are ‘priority pests’ if they fulfil all of the following conditions:
(a)
they fulfil, as regards the Union territory, one or more of the conditions set out in point (2) of Section 1 of Annex I;
(b)
their potential economic, environmental or social impact is the most severe in respect of the Union territory as set out in Section 2 of Annex I;
(c)
they are listed in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 105 supplementing this Regulation by establishing a list of the priority pests (‘list of priority pests’).
Where the results of an assessment show that a Union quarantine pest fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, or that a pest no longer fulfils one or more of those conditions, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 105 amending the list referred to in the first subparagraph accordingly by adding the pest concerned to, or removing it from, that list.
The Commission shall make that assessment available to the Member States without delay.
Where, in the case of a serious pest risk, imperative grounds of urgency so require, the procedure provided for in Article 106 shall apply to delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Article.
