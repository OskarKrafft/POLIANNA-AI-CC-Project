1.   The competent authority shall regularly inspect the quarantine stations and confinement facilities to verify whether they meet the requirements set out in Article 61 and the operation conditions set out in Article 62.
It shall determine the frequency of those inspections according to the pest risk related to the operation of the quarantine stations or confinement facilities.

Those measures may include the revocation or suspension of the designation referred to in Article 60(1).
