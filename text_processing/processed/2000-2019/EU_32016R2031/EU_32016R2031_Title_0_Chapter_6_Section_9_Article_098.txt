Article 98
Authorisation and supervision of registered operators applying the mark of wood packaging material in the Union territory
1.   An authorisation to apply the mark referred to in Article 96 and to repair wood packaging material in accordance with Article 97 shall be granted by the competent authority on application to a registered operator provided that the registered operator fulfils both of the following conditions:
(a)
it possesses the necessary knowledge to carry out the treatment of the wood packaging material, wood and other objects required pursuant to the acts referred to in Articles 96 and 97;
(b)
it operates appropriate facilities and equipment to carry out that treatment (‘treatment facilities’);
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 105 supplementing this Regulation by specifying the requirements for authorisation, where appropriate in view of the development of scientific and technical knowledge and international standards.
2.   An authorisation to apply the mark referred to in Article 96 and to repair wood packaging material according to Article 97 shall be granted by the competent authority on application to a registered operator using wood treated in a facility of another operator, provided that it fulfils all of the following conditions in respect of wood packaging material marked with that mark:
(a)
it exclusively uses wood:
(i)
which has been subject to one or more of the approved treatments referred to in Annex 1 of ISPM15 and has been treated in facilities operated by a registered operator authorised pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article; or
(ii)
which has been subject to one or more of the approved treatments referred to in Annex 1 of ISPM15 in a treatment facility in a third country that has been approved by the national plant protection organisation of that third country;
(b)
it ensures that the wood used for that purpose can be traced back to those treatment facilities in the Union territory or to the third country treatment facilities concerned;
(c)
where applicable pursuant to Article 28(1) and (2), Article 30(1) and (3), Article 41(2) and (3) and Article 54(2) and (3), it exclusively uses wood referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph which is accompanied by a plant passport or any other document providing guarantees that the treatment requirements referred to in Annex 1 to ISPM15 are fulfilled.
3.   The competent authority shall supervise at least once per year the registered operators authorised pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 to verify and ensure that they treat and mark as appropriate wood packaging material, wood and other objects in accordance with Article 96(1) and Article 97 and fulfil the conditions set out respectively in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
4.   Where the competent authority becomes aware that a professional operator does not comply with the requirements referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2, that authority shall without delay take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliance with those provisions does not continue.
Where the competent authority has taken those measures other than the withdrawal of the authorisation referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2, and the non-compliance continues, that authority shall without delay withdraw the authorisation referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2.
