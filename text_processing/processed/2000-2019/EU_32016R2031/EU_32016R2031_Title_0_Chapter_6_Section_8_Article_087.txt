Article 87
Examinations for plant passports
1.   A plant passport may only be issued for plants, plant products and other objects for which a meticulous examination in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 has shown that they fulfil the requirements of Article 85, and, where applicable, Article 86.
Plants, plant products and other objects may either be examined individually or by representative samples. The examination shall also cover the packaging material of the plants, plant products or other objects concerned.
2.   The examination shall be carried out by the authorised operator. However, in the following cases, the examination shall be carried out by the competent authority:
(a)
where point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 of this Article applies concerning inspections, sampling and testing;
(b)
where Article 84(2) applies; or
(c)
where an examination is carried out in the immediate vicinity as referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 of this Article and the authorised operator does not have access to that immediate vicinity.
3.   The examination shall fulfil all of the following conditions:
(a)
it shall be carried out at appropriate times and taking into account the risks involved;
(b)
it shall be carried out at the premises referred to in point (d) of Article 66(2). Where so required by the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 28(1), Article 30(1), Article 37(4), Article 41(2) or Article 54(2), an examination shall also be carried out in the immediate vicinity of the place of production of the plants, plant products or other object concerned;
(c)
it shall be made at least by visual examination, complemented by:
(i)
inspections, sampling and testing by the competent authority in the event of suspicion of the presence of a Union quarantine pest or pests subject to measures adopted pursuant to Article 30(1), or in the event of the suspicion of the presence of a protected zone quarantine pest in the respective protected zone; or
(ii)
sampling and testing in the event of suspicion of the presence of a Union regulated non-quarantine pest, where applicable above the respective thresholds;
(d)
its results shall be recorded and stored for at least three years.
That examination shall take place without prejudice to any specific examination requirements or measures adopted in accordance with Article 28(1), (2) or (3), Article 30(1), (3) or (4), Article 37(4), Article 41(2) or (3) or Article 54(2) or (3). Where those examination requirements or measures require the examination to be carried out by the competent authority, that examination shall not be carried out by the authorised operator referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.
4.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 105 supplementing this Regulation by setting out detailed measures concerning visual examination, sampling and testing, and the frequency and timing of the examinations, referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, with regard to specific plants, plant products and other objects, on the basis of the particular pest risks they may present. Those examinations shall, where appropriate, concern certain plants for planting belonging to pre-basic, basic, or certified material, seed or seed potatoes, or standard or CAC material or seed, as respectively referred to in Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 68/193/EEC, 2002/54/EC, 2002/55/EC, 2002/56/EC, 2002/57/EC, 2008/72/EC and 2008/90/EC.
Where the Commission adopts such delegated acts for specific plants for planting, and those plants for planting are subject to certification schemes pursuant to Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 68/193/EEC, 2002/54/EC, 2002/55/EC, 2002/56/EC, 2002/57/EC and 2008/90/EC, the Commission shall set out the requirements as regards the examinations for the presence of Union quarantine pests or pests subject to measures adopted pursuant to Article 30(1) of this Regulation and Union regulated non-quarantine pests and the examinations for other characteristics of the plants for planting pursuant to those Directives in a single certification scheme.
When adopting those delegated acts, the Commission shall take into account the development of scientific and technical knowledge and international standards.
