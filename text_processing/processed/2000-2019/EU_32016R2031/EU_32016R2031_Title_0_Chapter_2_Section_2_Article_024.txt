Article 24
Surveys of priority pests
1.   For each priority pest, Member States shall carry out a survey annually, as set out in Article 22(1) and (2). Those surveys shall include a sufficiently high number of visual examinations, sampling and testing, as appropriate for each priority pest, to ensure, as far as it is possible given the respective biology of each priority pest and the ecoclimatic conditions, with a high degree of confidence, the timely detection of those pests.
The surveys shall not be required to be carried out for pests for which it is unequivocally concluded that they cannot become established or spread in the Member State concerned due to its ecoclimatic conditions or to the absence of the host species.
2.   Member States shall report to the Commission and the other Member States by 30 April of each year the results of the surveys referred to in paragraph 1 which were carried out in the preceding calendar year.
