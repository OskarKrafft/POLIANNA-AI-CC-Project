Article 82
Exceptions for movements within and between the premises of a registered operator
No plant passport shall be required for the movements of plants, plant products and other objects within and between the premises of the same registered operator which are in close proximity to each other.
Member States may further define close proximity in their respective territories and whether any documents need to be issued for those movements instead of the plant passport.
Where such movements take place within two or more Member States, the exception from the requirement for a plant passport shall require approval by the competent authorities of the MemberÂ States concerned.
