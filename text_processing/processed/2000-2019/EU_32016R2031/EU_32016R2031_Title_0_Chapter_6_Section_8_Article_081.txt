Article 81
Exception for direct supply to final users
1.   No plant passport shall be required for the movement of plants, plant products or other objects supplied directly to a final user, including home gardeners.
That exception shall not apply to:
(a)
final users receiving those plants, plant products or other objects by means of sales through distance contracts; or
(b)
final users of plants, plant products or other objects for which a plant passport for protected zones is required pursuant to Article 80.
The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify that the requirements of point (b) of the second subparagraph shall only apply for particular protected zone pests, plants, plant products or other objects. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(2).
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 105 supplementing this Regulation by setting out the cases where, for particular plants, plant products or other objects, the exception of paragraph 1 of this Article shall only apply to small quantities. Those delegated acts shall define those quantities per period of time as appropriate to the plant, plant product or other object concerned and the respective pest risks.
