Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1.   This Regulation establishes rules to determine the phytosanitary risks posed by any species, strain or biotype of pathogenic agents, animals or parasitic plants injurious to plants or plant products (‘pests’) and measures to reduce those risks to an acceptable level.
2.   Where there is evidence that non-parasitic plants, other than those regulated under Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014, pose phytosanitary risks which would have a severe economic, social and environmental impact on the Union territory, those non-parasitic plants may be considered as pests for the purposes of this Regulation.
3.   For the purposes of this Regulation, references to third countries shall be read as references to third countries, Ceuta, Melilla and to the territories that are referred to in Article 355(1) TFEU, with the exception of Madeira and the Azores.
For the purposes of this Regulation, references to the Union territory shall be read as references to the Union territory without Ceuta, Melilla and the territories that are referred to in Article 355(1) TFEU, other than Madeira and the Azores.
