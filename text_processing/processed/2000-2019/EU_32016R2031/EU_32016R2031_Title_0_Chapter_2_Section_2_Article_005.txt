Article 5
Prohibition of introduction, movement, holding, multiplication or release of Union quarantine pests
1.   A Union quarantine pest shall not be introduced into, moved within, or held, multiplied or released in, the Union territory.
2.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, establish a list of pests which fulfil the conditions listed in Article 3 in respect of the Union territory (‘list of Union quarantine pests’).
The list of Union quarantine pests shall include the pests listed in Part A of Annex I to Directive 2000/29/EC and Section I of Part A of Annex II to that Directive.
Pests which are indigenous to, or established in, any part of the Union territory whether naturally or due to their introduction from outside the Union territory, shall be marked in the list of Union quarantine pests as pests known to occur in the Union territory.
Pests which are not indigenous to, or established in, any part of the Union territory shall be marked in the list of Union quarantine pests as pests not known to occur in the Union territory.
3.   Where the results of an assessment show that a pest not included in the list of Union quarantine pests fulfils the conditions listed in Article 3 in respect of the Union territory, or that a pest included in the list of Union quarantine pests no longer fulfils one or more of those conditions, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, amend the implementing act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article accordingly by adding the pest concerned to, or removing it from, that list.
The Commission shall make that assessment available to the Member States.
The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, replace the implementing act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article for the purpose of consolidating amendments.
4.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(2).
