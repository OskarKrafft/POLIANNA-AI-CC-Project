Article 10
Official confirmation by the competent authorities of the presence of a Union quarantine pest
Where a competent authority suspects or has received evidence concerning the presence of a Union quarantine pest, or a pest subject to measures adopted pursuant to Article 30(1), in a part of the territory of its Member State where that pest was previously not known to be present, or in a consignment of plants, plant products or other objects introduced into, intended to be introduced into, or moved within, the Union territory, it shall immediately take the measures necessary to confirm whether that pest is present (‘to officially confirm’).
That official confirmation shall be based on a diagnosis from an official laboratory designated by the competent authority in accordance with conditions and requirements set out in Union legislation on official controls.
Pending the official confirmation of the presence of the pest, the Member State concerned shall, where appropriate, take phytosanitary measures to eliminate the risk of spread of the pest.
The suspicion or evidence referred to in the first paragraph of this Article may be based on any information received pursuant to Articles 14 and 15, or any other source.
