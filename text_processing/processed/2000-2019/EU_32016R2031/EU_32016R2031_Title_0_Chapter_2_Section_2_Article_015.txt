Article 15
Measures to be taken by persons other than professional operators
1.   Where any person other than a professional operator becomes aware of the presence of a Union quarantine pest or has reason to suspect such a presence, that person shall immediately notify the competent authority. Where that notification is not made in writing, the competent authority shall officially record it. If so requested by the competent authority, that person shall provide that authority with the information which is in its possession concerning that presence.
2.   The competent authority may decide that the notification referred to in paragraph 1 is not required where a specific pest is known to be present in an area.
3.   The person who made the notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall consult the competent authority on the action to be taken and shall, in accordance with the instructions of the competent authority, take the measures necessary to prevent the spread of that pest and to eliminate it from the plants, plant products or other objects concerned and, where applicable, from that person's premises.
