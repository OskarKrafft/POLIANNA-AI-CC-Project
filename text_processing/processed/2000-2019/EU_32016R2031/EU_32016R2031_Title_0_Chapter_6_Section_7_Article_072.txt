(c)
plants, plant products and other objects for which requirements have been adopted pursuant to point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 28(1) and Article 30(1) concerning their introduction into the Union territory;
(d)

(f)
plants, plant products and other objects subject to points (a) and (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 49(2).
Points (a) to (e) of the first subparagraph shall not apply and a phytosanitary certificate shall not be required where an implementing act adopted pursuant to point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 28(1), Article 30(1) or Article 41(2) and (3) requires proof of compliance in the form of an official mark, as referred to in Article 96(1), or another official attestation, as referred to in Article 99(1).
In the list established by that implementing act, the plants, plant products and other objects shall also be identified by their respective CN code, where that code is available. Other codes laid down by Union legislation shall, in addition, be referred to where they specify further the applicable CN code for a specific plant, plant product or other object.
2.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, amend the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 in any of the following cases:
(a)
where a plant, plant product or other object listed in that act does not fulfil point (c), (d) or (e) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1;
(b)
where a plant, plant product or other object not listed in that act fulfils point (c), (d) or (e) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1.
3.   In addition to the cases referred to in paragraph 2, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, amend the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1, in accordance with the principles set out in Section 2 of Annex II, where there is a risk that a plant, plant product or other object not listed in that act hosts a Union quarantine pest or pest subject to measures adopted pursuant to Article 30(1), or where, for a plant, plant product or other object listed in that act, that risk no longer exists.
4.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(2).
5.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, no phytosanitary certificate shall be required for the plants, plant products or other objects which are subject to Articles 46, 47 and 48 and Article 75(1).
