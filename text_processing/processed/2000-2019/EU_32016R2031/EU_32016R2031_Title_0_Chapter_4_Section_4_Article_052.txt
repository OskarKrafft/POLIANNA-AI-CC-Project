Article 52
Temporary measures by Member States concerning imminent danger
1.   Where a Member State considers that the introduction into, or movement within, its territory of plants, plant products or other objects from certain third countries or certain other Member States poses an unacceptable level of pest risk concerning the entry into, and establishment and spread in, its territory of a Union quarantine pest or a pest assessed to fulfil the conditions for inclusion in the list of Union quarantine pests, and that risk is not adequately mitigated by the measures referred to in Article 17(1) and (2), Article 18(1), Article 19(1), Article 28(1) and (2), Article 29(1), Article 30(1) and (3), Article 40(2) and (3), Article 41(2) and (3), Article 42(3), Article 49(1) and Article 53, it shall notify in writing the Commission and the other Member States of the Union measures it would like to be taken, together with the technical or scientific justification for those measures.
2.   If a Member State considers that the Union measures referred to in paragraph 1 are not being, or cannot be, taken in sufficient time to mitigate the risk referred to that paragraph, it may take temporary measures to protect its territory against the imminent danger. Those temporary measures, and the technical justification for those measures, shall be notified immediately to the Commission and the other Member States.
3.   Where the Commission receives the notification referred to in paragraph 1, it shall immediately assess whether the risk referred to in paragraph 1 is adequately mitigated by the measures referred to in Article 17(1) and (2), Article 18(1), Article 19(1), Article 28(1) and (2), Article 29(1), Article 30(1) and (3), Article 40(2) and (3), Article 41(2) and (3), Article 42(3), Article 49(1) and Article 53, or whether any new measure should be adopted pursuant to those Articles.
4.   Where, on the basis of the assessment referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission concludes that the risk referred to in paragraph 1 is not adequately mitigated by the temporary measures taken by the Member State pursuant to paragraph 2, or if those measures are disproportionate or not adequately justified, it may decide, by means of implementing acts, that those measures are to be repealed or amended. Until such an implementing act has been adopted by the Commission, the Member State may maintain the measures that it has taken.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(2).
