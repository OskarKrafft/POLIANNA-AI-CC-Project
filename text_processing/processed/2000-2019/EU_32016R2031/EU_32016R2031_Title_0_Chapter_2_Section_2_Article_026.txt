Article 26
Simulation exercises for priority pests
1.   Member States shall carry out simulation exercises concerning the implementation of the contingency plans at intervals set according to the biology of the priority pest or pests concerned and the risk posed by that pest or those pests.
Those exercises shall take place with regard to all priority pests concerned within a reasonable period of time and with the involvement of the relevant stakeholders.
Those exercises shall not be required where the Member State concerned has recently taken measures for the eradication of the pest or pests concerned.
2.   Simulation exercises concerning priority pests whose presence in one Member State could have an impact on neighbouring Member States may be carried out together by those Member States on the basis of their respective contingency plans.
Where appropriate, Member States may carry out those simulation exercises with neighbouring third countries.
3.   Member States shall, on request, make available a report on the results of each simulation exercise to the Commission and to the other Member States.
