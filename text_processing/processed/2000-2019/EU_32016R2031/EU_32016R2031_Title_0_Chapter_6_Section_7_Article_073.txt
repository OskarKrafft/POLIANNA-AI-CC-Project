Article 73
Other plants for which phytosanitary certificates are required
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, provide that for plants, other than the plants included in the list referred to in Article 72(1), a phytosanitary certificate is required for introduction into the Union territory.
However, those implementing acts shall provide that a phytosanitary certificate is not required for those plants where an assessment, based on evidence about pest risks and experience with trade, demonstrates that such a certificate is not necessary. That assessment shall take into account the criteria set out in Annex VI. Where appropriate, that assessment may only concern plants of a particular third country of origin or dispatch, or a group of third countries of origin or dispatch.
In the list established by those implementing acts, the plants shall also be identified by their respective CN code, where that code is available.
Other codes laid down by Union legislation shall, in addition, be referred to where they specify further the applicable CN code for a specific plant, plant product or other object.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(2). The first of those acts shall be adopted by 14 December 2018.
