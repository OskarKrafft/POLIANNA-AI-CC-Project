Article 11
Customs procedures
1.   Member States shall ensure that, when completing the formalities for the export of defence-related products at the customs office responsible for handling the export declaration, the exporter furnishes proof that any necessary export licence has been obtained.
2.   Without prejudice to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (10), a Member State may also, for a period not exceeding 30 working days, suspend the process of export from its territory of defence-related products received from another Member State under a transfer licence and incorporated in another defence-related product or, if necessary, prevent by other means such products from leaving the Community from its territory, where it considers that:
(a)
relevant information was not taken into account when the export licence was granted; or
(b)
circumstances have materially changed since the grant of the export licence.
3.   Member States may provide that customs formalities for the export of defence-related products can be completed only at certain customs offices.
4.   Member States availing themselves of the option set out in paragraph 3 shall inform the Commission of the relevant customs offices. The Commission shall publish that information in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.
