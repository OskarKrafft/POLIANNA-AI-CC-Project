ArticleÂ 10
Export limitations
Member States shall ensure that recipients of defence-related products, when applying for an export licence, declare to their competent authorities, in cases where such products received under a transfer licence from another Member State have export limitations attached to them, that they have complied with the terms of those limitations, including, as the case may be, by having obtained the required consent from the originating Member State.
