Article 15
Safeguard measures
1.   Where a licensing Member State considers that there is a serious risk that a recipient certified in accordance with Article 9 in another Member State will not comply with a condition attached to a general transfer licence, or where a licensing Member State considers that public policy, public security or its essential security interests could be affected, it shall inform that other Member State and request verification of the situation.
2.   Where the doubts referred to in paragraph 1 persist, the licensing Member State may provisionally suspend the effect of its general transfer licence with regard to such recipients. It shall inform the other Member States and the Commission of the reasons for that safeguard measure. The Member State which adopted that measure may decide to lift it where it considers that it is no longer justified.
