The working plan shall set out for the following three years an indicative list of product groups which are considered as priorities for the adoption of implementing measures.
The working plan shall be amended periodically by the Commission after consultation with the Consultation Forum.
2.   However, during the transitional period, while the first working plan referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is being established, and, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 15, and after consulting the Consultation Forum, the Commission shall, as appropriate, introduce by anticipation:
(a)
implementing measures starting with those products which have been identified by the ECCP as offering a high potential for cost-effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as heating and water heating equipment, electric motor systems, lighting in both the domestic and tertiary sectors, domestic appliances, office equipment in both the domestic and tertiary sectors, consumer electronics and HVAC (heating ventilating air conditioning) systems; and
(b)
a separate implementing measure reducing stand-by losses for a group of products.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 19(3).
