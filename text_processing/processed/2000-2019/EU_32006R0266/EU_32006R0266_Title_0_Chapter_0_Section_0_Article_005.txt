Article 5
Measures adopted by the Commission
1.   After consultation with the Sugar Protocol country concerned, the multiannual adaptation strategy shall be adopted under the procedure referred to in Article 7(2) and in accordance with Article 4.

3.   Assistance to Sugar Protocol countries without a multiannual adaptation strategy shall be subject in 2006 to an annual work programme, adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2).
4.   The assistance provided for under this Regulation shall be complementary but additional to assistance provided under other instruments of development cooperation.
