Article 16
General animal health provisions
1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to guarantee that animal by-products, and products derived therefrom referred to in Annexes VII and VIII, are not dispatched from any holding situated in a zone subject to restrictions because of the occurrence of a disease to which the species from which the product is derived is susceptible, or from any plant or zone from which movements or trade would constitute a risk to the animal health status of the Member States or areas of Member States, except where products are treated in accordance with this Regulation.
2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall guarantee that the products are obtained from animals that:
(a) come from a holding, territory or part of a territory or, in the case of aquaculture products, from a farm, zone or part of a zone, not subject to animal health restrictions applicable to the animals and products concerned, and in particular restrictions under disease control measures imposed by Community legislation or by virtue of a serious transmissible disease listed in Council Directive 92/119/EEC of 17 December 1992 introducing general Community measures for the control of certain animal diseases and specific measures relating to swine vesicular disease(22);
(b) were not slaughtered in a plant in which animals infected, or suspected of being infected, with one of the diseases covered by the rules referred to in (a) were present at the time of slaughter.
3. Subject to compliance with the disease control measures referred to in paragraph 2(a), the placing on the market of animal by-products, and products derived therefrom referred to in Annexes VII and VIII, that come from a territory or part of a territory subject to animal health restrictions but are not infected or suspected of being infected shall be permitted provided that, as appropriate, the products:
(a) are obtained, handled, transported and stored separately from or at different times from products fulfilling all animal health conditions;
(b) have undergone a treatment sufficient to eliminate the animal health problem concerned in accordance with this Regulation at a plant approved for that purpose by the Member State where the animal health problem occurred;
(c) are properly identified;
(d) comply with the requirements laid down in Annexes VII and VIII, or with detailed rules to be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
Conditions alternative to those set out in the first subparagraph may be laid down in specific situations by decisions adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 33(2). Such decisions shall take account of any measures concerning the animals or tests to be carried out on them and the specific characteristics of the disease in the species concerned and shall specify any measures needed to ensure the protection of animal health in the Community.
