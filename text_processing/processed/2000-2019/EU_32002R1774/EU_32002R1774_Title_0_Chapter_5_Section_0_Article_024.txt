Article 24
Derogations regarding the disposal of animal by-products
1. The competent authority may, where necessary, decide that:
(a) dead pet animals may be directly disposed of as waste by burial;
(b) the following animal by-products originating in remote areas may be disposed of as waste by burning or burial on site:
(i) Category 1 material referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(ii),
(ii) Category 2 material, and
(iii) Category 3 material; and
(c) animal by-products may be disposed of as waste by burning or burial on site in the event of an outbreak of a disease mentioned in List A of the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE), if the competent authority rejects transport to the nearest incineration or processing plant because of the danger of propagation of health risks or because a widespread outbreak of an epizootic disease leads to a lack of capacity at such plants.
2. No derogation may be granted in respect of Category 1 material referred to in Article 4(1)(a)(i).
3. In the case of Category 1 material referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(ii), burning or burial may take place in accordance with paragraph 1(b) or (c) only if the competent authority authorises and supervises the method used and is satisfied that it precludes all risk of transmission of TSEs.
4. Member States shall inform the Commission of:
(a) the use they make of the possibilities provided for in paragraph 1(b) in respect of Category 1 and Category 2 material; and
(b) the areas that they categorise as remote areas for the purpose of applying paragraph 1(b) and the reasons for that categorisation.
5. The competent authority shall take the measures necessary:
(a) to ensure that the burning or burial of animal by-products does not endanger animal or human health; and
(b) to prevent the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of animal by-products.
6. Detailed arrangements for implementing this Article may be laid down under the procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
