Article 25
Plants' own-checks
1. Operators and owners of intermediate and processing plants or their representatives shall adopt all measures necessary to comply with the requirements of this Regulation. They shall put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure developed in accordance with the principles of the system of hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP). They shall in particular:
(a) identify and control the critical control points in the plants;
(b) establish and implement methods for monitoring and checking such critical control points;
(c) in the case of processing plants, take representative samples to check compliance:
(i) of each processed batch with the standards for the products established by this Regulation, and
(ii) with the maximum permitted levels of physicochemical residues laid down in Community legislation;
(d) record the results of the checks and tests referred to in points (b) and (c) and keep them for a period of at least two years for presentation to the competent authorities;
(e) introduce a system ensuring the traceablility of each batch dispatched.
2. Where the results of a test on samples taken pursuant to paragraph 1(c) do not comply with the provisions of this Regulation, the operator of the processing plant must:
(a) notify the competent authority immediately of the full details of the nature of the sample and the batch from which it was derived;
(b) establish the causes of failures of compliance;
(c) reprocess or dispose of the contaminated batch under the supervision of the competent authority;
(d) ensure that no material suspected or known to be contaminated is moved from the plant before being reprocessed under the supervision of the competent authority and re-sampled officially in order to comply with the standards laid down in this Regulation, unless destined for disposal;
(e) increase the frequency of sampling and testing of production;
(f) investigate animal by-products records appropriate to the finished sample; and
(g) instigate appropriate decontamination and cleaning procedures within the plant.
3. Detailed arrangements for implementing this Article, including rules concerning the frequency of checks and reference methods for microbiological analyses, may be laid down under the procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
