Article 8
Releases from diffuse sources
1.   The Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency, shall include in the European PRTR information on releases from diffuse sources where such information exists and has already been reported by the Member States.
2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be organised such as to allow users to search for and identify releases of pollutants from diffuse sources according to an adequate geographical disaggregation and shall include information on the type of methodology used to derive the information.
3.   Where the Commission determines that no data on the releases from diffuse sources exist, it shall take measures to initiate reporting on releases of relevant pollutants from one or more diffuse sources in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 19(2), using internationally approved methodologies where appropriate.
