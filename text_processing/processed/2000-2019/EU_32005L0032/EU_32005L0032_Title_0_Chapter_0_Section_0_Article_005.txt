Article 5
Marking and declaration of conformity
1.   Before an EuP covered by implementing measures is placed on the market and/or put into service, a CE conformity marking shall be affixed and a declaration of conformity issued whereby the manufacturer or its authorised representative ensures and declares that the EuP complies with all relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure.
2.   The CE conformity marking consists of the initials ‘CE’ as shown in Annex III.
3.   The declaration of conformity shall contain the elements specified in Annex VI and shall refer to the appropriate implementing measure.
4.   The affixing of markings on an EuP which are likely to mislead users as to the meaning or form of the CE marking shall be prohibited.
5.   Member States may require the information to be supplied pursuant to Annex I, Part 2 to be in their official language(s) when the EuP reaches the end-user.
Member States shall also authorise the provision of this information in one or more other official Community language(s).
When applying the first subparagraph, Member States shall take into account in particular:
(a)
whether the information can be supplied by harmonised symbols or recognised codes or other measures;
(b)
the type of user anticipated for the EuP and the nature of the information which is to be provided.
