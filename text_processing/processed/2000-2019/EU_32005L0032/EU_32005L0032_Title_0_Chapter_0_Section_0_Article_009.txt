Article 9
Presumption of conformity
1.   Member States shall regard an EuP bearing the CE marking referred to in Article 5 as conforming to the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure.
2.   Member States shall regard an EuP for which harmonised standards have been applied, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, as conforming to all the relevant requirements of the applicable implementing measure to which such standards relate.
3.   EuPs which have been awarded the Community eco-label pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 shall be presumed to comply with the ecodesign requirements of the applicable implementing measure insofar as those requirements are met by the eco-label.
4.   For the purposes of the presumption of conformity in the context of this Directive, the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 19(2), may decide that other eco-labels fulfil equivalent conditions to the Community eco-label pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000. EuPs which have been awarded such other eco-labels shall be presumed to comply with the ecodesign requirements of the applicable implementing measure, insofar as those requirements are met by that eco-label.
