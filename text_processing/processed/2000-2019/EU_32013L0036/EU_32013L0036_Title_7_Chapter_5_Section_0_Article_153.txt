Article 153
Measures taken by the competent authorities of the home Member State in relation to activities carried out in the host Member State
1.   Where the competent authorities of a host Member State ascertain that a credit institution having a branch or providing services within its territory is not complying with the legal provisions adopted in that Member State pursuant to this Directive involving powers of the host Member State's competent authorities, those authorities shall require the credit institution concerned to remedy its non-compliance.
2.   If the credit institution concerned fails to take the necessary steps, the competent authorities of the host Member State shall inform the competent authorities of the home Member State accordingly.
3.   The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, at the earliest opportunity, take all appropriate measures to ensure that the credit institution concerned remedies its non-compliance. The nature of those measures shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the host Member State.
4.   If, despite the measures taken by the home Member State or because such measures prove inadequate or are not provided for in the Member State in question, the credit institution persists in violating the legal rules referred to in paragraph 1 in force in the host Member State, the latter may, after informing the competent authorities of the home Member State, take appropriate measures to prevent or to punish further breaches and, in so far as is necessary, to prevent that credit institution from initiating further transactions within its territory. Member States shall ensure that it is possible to serve the legal documents necessary for those measures on credit institutions within their territories.
