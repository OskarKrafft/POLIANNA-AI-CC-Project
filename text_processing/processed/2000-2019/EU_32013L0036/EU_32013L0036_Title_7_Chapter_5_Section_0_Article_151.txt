Article 151
Scope
1.   The provisions in this Chapter shall apply instead of Articles 40, 41, 43, 49, 50 and 51 until the date on which the liquidity coverage requirement becomes applicable in accordance with a delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 460 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
2.   In order to ensure that the phasing in of supervisory arrangements for liquidity is fully aligned with the development of uniform liquidity rules, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 145 postponing the date referred to in paragraph 1 by up to two years, where uniform liquidity rules have not been introduced in the Union because international standards on liquidity supervision have not yet been agreed upon at the date referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
