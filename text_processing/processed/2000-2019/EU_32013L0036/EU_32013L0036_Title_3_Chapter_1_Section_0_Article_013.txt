Article 13
Effective direction of the business and place of the head office
1.   The competent authorities shall grant authorisation to commence the activity of a credit institution only where at least two persons effectively direct the business of the applicant credit institution.
They shall refuse such authorisation if the members of the management body do not meet the requirements referred to in Article 91(1).

(a)
a credit institution which is a legal person and which, under its national law, has a registered office, has its head office in the same Member State as its registered office;
(b)
a credit institution other than that referred to in point (a) has its head office in the Member State which granted it authorisation and in which it actually carries out its business.
