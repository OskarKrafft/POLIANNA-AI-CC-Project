Article 103
Application of supervisory measures to institutions with similar risk profiles
1.   Where the competent authorities determine under Article 97 that institutions with similar risk profiles such as similar business models or geographical location of exposures, are or might be exposed to similar risks or pose similar risks to the financial system, they may apply the supervisory review and evaluation process referred to in Article 97 to those institutions in a similar or identical manner. For those purposes, Member States shall ensure that competent authorities have the necessary legal powers to impose requirements under this Directive and under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on those institutions in a similar or identical manner, including in particular the exercise of supervisory powers under Articles 104, 105 and 106.
The types of institution referred to in the first subparagraph may in particular be determined in accordance with the criteria referred to in Article 98(1)(j).
2.   The competent authorities shall notify EBA where they apply paragraph 1. EBA shall monitor supervisory practices and issue guidelines to specify how similar risks should be assessed and how consistent application of paragraph 1 across the Union can be ensured. Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010
