Article 160
Transitional provisions for capital buffers
1.   This Article amends the requirements of Articles 129 and 130 for a transitional period between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018.
2.   For the period from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2016:
(a)
the capital conservation buffer shall consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital equal to 0,625 % of the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(b)
the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer shall be no more than 0,625 % of the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
3.   For the period from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2017:
(a)
the capital conservation buffer shall consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital equal to 1,25 % of the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(b)
the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer shall be no more than 1,25 % of the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
4.   For the period from 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2018:
(a)
the capital conservation buffer shall consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital equal to 1,875 % of the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(b)
the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer shall be no more than 1,875 % of the total of the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
5.   The requirement for a capital conservation plan and the restrictions on distributions referred to in Articles 141 and 142 shall apply during the transitional period between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018 where institutions fail to meet the combined buffer requirement taking into account the requirements set out in paragraphs 2 to 4 of this Article.
6.   Member States may impose a shorter transitional period than that specified in paragraphs 1 to 4 and thereby implement the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer from 31 December 2013. Where a Member State imposes such a shorter transitional period, it shall inform the relevant parties, including the Commission, the ESRB, EBA and the relevant supervisory colleges, accordingly. Such a shorter transitional period may be recognised by other Member States. Where another Member State recognises such a shorter transitional period, it shall notify the Commission, the ESRB, EBA and the relevant supervisory college accordingly.
7.   Where a Member State imposes a shorter transitional period for the countercyclical capital buffer the shorter period shall apply only for the purposes of the calculation of the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer by institutions that are authorised in the Member State for which the designated authority is responsible.
