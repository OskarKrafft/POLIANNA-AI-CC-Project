Article 138
ESRB recommendation on third country countercyclical buffer rates
The ESRB may, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, issue a recommendation to designated authorities on the appropriate countercyclical buffer rate for exposures to that third country where:
(a)
a countercyclical buffer rate has not been set and published by the relevant third-country authority for a third country (‧relevant third-country authority‧) to which one or more Union institutions have credit exposures;
(b)
the ESRB considers that a countercyclical buffer rate which has been set and published by the relevant third-country authority for a third country is not sufficient to protect Union institutions appropriately from the risks of excessive credit growth in that country, or a designated authority notifies the ESRB that it considers that buffer rate to be insufficient for that purpose.
