Article 19
Name of credit institutions
For the purposes of exercising their activities, credit institutions may, notwithstanding any provisions in the host Member State concerning the use of the words ‧bank‧, ‧savings bank‧ or other banking names, use throughout the territory of the Union the same name that they use in the Member State in which their head office is situated.
