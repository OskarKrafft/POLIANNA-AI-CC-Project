Article 104
Supervisory powers
1.   For the purposes of Article 97, Article 98(4), Article 101(4) and Articles 102 and 103 and the application of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities shall have at least the following powers:
(a)
to require institutions to hold own funds in excess of the requirements set out in Chapter 4 of this Title and in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 relating to elements of risks and risks not covered by Article 1 of that Regulation;
(b)
to require the reinforcement of the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies implemented in accordance with Articles 73 and 74;
(c)
to require institutions to present a plan to restore compliance with supervisory requirements pursuant to this Directive and to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and set a deadline for its implementation, including improvements to that plan regarding scope and deadline;
(d)
to require institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds requirements;
(e)
to restrict or limit the business, operations or network of institutions or to request the divestment of activities that pose excessive risks to the soundness of an institution;
(f)
to require the reduction of the risk inherent in the activities, products and systems of institutions;
(g)
to require institutions to limit variable remuneration as a percentage of net revenues where it is inconsistent with the maintenance of a sound capital base;
(h)
to require institutions to use net profits to strengthen own funds;
(i)
to restrict or prohibit distributions or interest payments by an institution to shareholders, members or holders of Additional Tier 1 instruments where the prohibition does not constitute an event of default of the institution;
(j)
to impose additional or more frequent reporting requirements, including reporting on capital and liquidity positions;
(k)
to impose specific liquidity requirements, including restrictions on maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities;
(l)
to require additional disclosures.
2.   The additional own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 1(a) shall be imposed by the competent authorities at least where,
(a)
an institution does not meet the requirement set out in Articles 73 and 74 of this Directive or in Article 393 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(b)
risks or elements of risks are not covered by the own funds requirements set out in Chapter 4 of this Title or in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(c)
the sole application of other administrative measures is unlikely to improve the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies sufficiently within an appropriate timeframe;
(d)
the review referred to in Article 98(4) or Article 101(4) reveals that the non-compliance with the requirements for the application of the respective approach will likely lead to inadequate own funds requirements;
(e)
the risks are likely to be underestimated despite compliance with the applicable requirements of this Directive and of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; or
(f)
an institution reports to the competent authority in accordance with Article 377(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 that the stress test results referred to in that Article materially exceed its own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio.
3.   For the purposes of determining the appropriate level of own funds on the basis of the review and evaluation carried out in accordance with Section III, the competent authorities shall assess whether any imposition of an additional own funds requirement in excess of the own funds requirement is necessary to capture risks to which an institution is or might be exposed, taking into account the following:
(a)
the quantitative and qualitative aspects of an institution's assessment process referred to in Article 73;
(b)
an institution's arrangements, processes and mechanisms referred to in Article 74;
(c)
the outcome of the review and evaluation carried out in accordance with Article 97 or 101;
(d)
the assessment of systemic risk.
