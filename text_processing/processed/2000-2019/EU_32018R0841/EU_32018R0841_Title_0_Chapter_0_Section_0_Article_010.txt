Article 10
Accounting for natural disturbances
1.   At the end of each of the periods from 2021 to 2025 and from 2026 to 2030, Member States may exclude from their accounts for afforested land and managed forest land greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from natural disturbances, that exceed the average emissions caused by natural disturbances in the period from 2001 to 2020, excluding statistical outliers (‘background level’). That background level shall be calculated in accordance with this Article and Annex VI.
2.   Where a Member State applies paragraph 1, it shall:
(a)
submit to the Commission information on the background level for the land accounting categories referred to in paragraph 1 and on the data and methodologies used in accordance with Annex VI; and
(b)
exclude from accounting until 2030 all subsequent removals on the land affected by natural disturbances.
3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 to amend Annex VI in order to revise the methodology and information requirements in that Annex to reflect changes in the IPCC Guidelines as adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC or the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.
