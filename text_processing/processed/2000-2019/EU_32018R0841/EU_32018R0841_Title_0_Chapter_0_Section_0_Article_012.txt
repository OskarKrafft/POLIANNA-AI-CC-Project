Article 12
General flexibilities
1.   Where total emissions exceed total removals in a Member State, and that Member State has chosen to use its flexibility, and has requested to delete annual emission allocations under Regulation (EU) 2018/842, the quantity of deleted emission allocations shall be taken into account with respect to the Member State’s compliance with its commitment pursuant to Article 4 of this Regulation.
2.   To the extent that total removals exceed total emissions in a Member State and after subtraction of any quantity taken into account under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842, that Member State may transfer the remaining quantity of removals to another Member State. The quantity transferred shall be taken into account when assessing the recipient Member State’s compliance with its commitment pursuant to Article 4 of this Regulation.
3.   To the extent that total removals exceed total emissions in a Member State in the period from 2021 to 2025, and after subtraction of any quantity taken into account under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 or transferred to another Member State pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, that Member State may bank the remaining quantity of removals to the period from 2026 to 2030.
4.   In order to avoid double counting, the quantity of net removals taken into account under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 shall be subtracted from that Member State’s quantity available for transfer to another Member State or for banking pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.
