Article 20
Cooperation with the Energy Community Contracting Parties
Where the Member States and the Energy Community Contracting Parties cooperate in the area of security of electricity supply, such cooperation may include defining an electricity crisis, the process of the identification of electricity crisis scenarios and the establishment of risk-preparedness plans so that no measures are taken that endanger the security of electricity supply of the MemberÂ States, Energy Community Contracting Parties or the Union. In that respect, the Energy Community Contracting Parties may, at the invitation of the Commission, participate in the ECG with regard to all matters with which they are concerned.
