Article 17
Ex post evaluation

1.   As soon as possible and in any event three months after the end of an electricity crisis, the competent authority of the Member State that declared the electricity crisis shall provide the ECG and the Commission with an ex post evaluation report, after having consulted the regulatory authority, where the regulatory authority is not the competent authority.
2.   The ex post evaluation report shall include at least:
(a)
a description of the event that triggered the electricity crisis;
(b)
a description of any preventive, preparatory and mitigating measures taken and an assessment of their proportionality and effectiveness;
(c)
an assessment of the cross-border impact of the measures taken;
(d)
an account of the assistance prepared, with or without effective activation, provided to or received from neighbouring Member States and third countries;
(e)
the economic impact of the electricity crisis and the impact of the measures taken on the electricity sector to an extent allowed by data available at the time of the assessment, in particular the volumes of energy non-served and the level of manual demand disconnection (including a comparison between the level of voluntary and forced demand disconnection);
(f)
reasons justifying the application of any non-market-based measures;
(g)
any possible improvements or proposed improvements to the risk-preparedness plan;
(h)
an overview of possible improvements to grid development in cases where insufficient network development caused or contributed to the electricity crisis.
3.   Where they consider the information provided in the ex post evaluation report to be insufficient, the ECG and the Commission may request the competent authority concerned to provide additional information.
4.   The competent authority concerned shall present the results of the ex post evaluation at a meeting of the ECG. Those results shall be reflected in the updated risk-preparedness plan.
