Article 2
By 29 January 2006 at the latest, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council outlining the progress made in the re-evaluations of additives under way and setting out a provisional calendar for future re-evaluations, especially those for sucralose and salt of aspartame-acesulfame. These re-evaluations shall be carried out on the basis of consumer data supplied by the Member States and shall take account of the effects of additives on vulnerable population groups.
