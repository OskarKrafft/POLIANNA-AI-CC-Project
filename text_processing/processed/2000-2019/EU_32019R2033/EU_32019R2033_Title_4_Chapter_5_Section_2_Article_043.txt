2.   Cash, short term deposits and financial instruments belonging to clients, even where held in the own name of the investment firm, shall not be treated as liquid assets for the purposes of paragraph 1.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, investment firms that meet the conditions for qualifying as small and non‐interconnected investment firms set out in Article 12(1) of this Regulation and investment firms that do not meet the conditions for qualifying as small and non‐interconnected investment firms set out in Article 12(1) of this Regulation but which do not carry out any of the activities referred to in points (3) and (6) of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU may also include receivables from trade debtors as well as fees or commissions receivable within 30 days in their liquid assets, where those receivables comply with the following conditions:
(a)
they account for up to a maximum of one third of the minimum liquidity requirements as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article;

they are not to be counted towards any additional liquidity requirements required by the competent authority for firm‐specific risks in accordance with point (k) of Article 39(2) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034;

they are subject to a haircut of 50 %.
4.   For the purposes of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, EBA, in consultation with ESMA, shall issue guidelines specifying further the criteria which the competent authorities may take into account when exempting investment firms that meet the conditions for qualifying as small and non‐interconnected investment firms set out in Article 12(1) from the liquidity requirement.
