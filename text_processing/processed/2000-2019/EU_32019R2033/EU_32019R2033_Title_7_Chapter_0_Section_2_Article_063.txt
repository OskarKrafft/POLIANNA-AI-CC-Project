(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   The Commission may adopt a decision in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 51(2) in relation to a third country stating that the legal and supervisory arrangements of that third country ensure all of the following:
(a)
that firms authorised in that third country comply with legally binding prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements which have equivalent effect to the requirements set out in this Regulation, in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*9), in Directive 2013/36/EU, Directive 2014/65/EU and Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*10), and in the implementing measures adopted under those legislative acts;
(b)
that firms authorised in that third country are subject to effective supervision and enforcement ensuring compliance with the applicable legally binding prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements; and
(c)
that the legal framework of that third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of investment firms authorised under third‐country legal regimes.
Where the scale and scope of the services provided and the activities performed by third‐country firms in the Union following the adoption of the decision referred to in the first subparagraph are likely to be of systemic importance for the Union, the legally binding prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements referred to in the first subparagraph may only be considered to have equivalent effect to the requirements set out in the acts referred to in that subparagraph after a detailed and granular assessment. To that end, the Commission shall also assess and take into account the supervisory convergence between the third country concerned and the Union.
1a.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 50 to supplement this Regulation by further specifying the circumstances under which the scale and scope of the services provided and activities performed by third‐country firms in the Union following the adoption of an equivalence decision referred to in the paragraph 1 are likely to be of systemic importance to the Union.
Where the scale and scope of the services provided and activities performed by third‐country firms are likely to be of systemic importance for the Union, the Commission may attach specific operational conditions to equivalence decisions to ensure that ESMA and national competent authorities have the necessary tools to prevent regulatory arbitrage and monitor the activities of third‐country investment firms registered in accordance with Article 46(2) in respect of services provided and activities performed in the Union by ensuring that those firms comply with:
(a)
requirements which have an equivalent effect to the requirements referred to in Articles 20 and 21;
(b)
reporting requirements which have an equivalent effect to the requirements referred to in Article 26, where such information cannot be obtained directly and on an ongoing basis through a Memorandum of Understanding with the third‐country competent authority;
(c)
requirements that have an equivalent effect to the trading obligation referred to in Articles 23 and 28, where applicable.
When adopting the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall take into account whether the third country is identified as a non‐cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes under the relevant Union policy or as a high‐risk third country pursuant to Article 9(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.
1b.   The prudential, organisational and business conduct framework of a third country may be considered to have equivalent effect where that framework fulfils all of the following conditions:
(a)
firms providing investment services or performing investment activities in that third country are subject to authorisation and to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis;
(b)
firms providing investment services or performing investment activities in that third country are subject to sufficient capital requirements and, in particular, firms providing services or carrying out the activities referred to in point (3) or (6) of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU are subject to comparable capital requirements to those they would apply if they were established in the Union;
(c)
firms providing investment services or performing investment activities in that third country are subject to appropriate requirements applicable to shareholders and members of their management body;
(d)
firms providing investment services or performing investment activities are subject to adequate business conduct and organisational requirements;
(e)
market transparency and integrity is ensured by preventing market abuse in the form of insider dealing and market manipulation.
For the purposes of paragraph 1a of this Article, when assessing the equivalence of third-country rules as regards the trading obligation set out in Articles 23 and 28, the Commission shall also assess whether the third country’s legal framework provides for criteria for the designation of trading venues as eligible for compliance with the trading obligation which have a similar effect to those set out under this Regulation or under Directive 2014/65/EU.
