Article 15
Cooperation
Where a Member State referred to in Article 39(3) determines that a certificate of qualification issued by a competent authority in another Member State does not satisfy conditions laid down by this Directive, or where there are reasons of safety or public order, the competent authority shall request the issuing authority to consider suspending that certificate of qualification pursuant to Article 14. The requesting authority shall inform the Commission of its request. The authority that issued the certificate of qualification in question shall examine the request and shall notify the other authority of its decision. Any competent authority may prohibit persons from operating in its area of jurisdiction pending notification of the issuing authorityâ€™s decision.
The Member States referred to in Article 39(3) shall also cooperate with competent authorities of other Member States in order to ensure that navigation time and journeys for holders of certificates of qualification and service record books recognised under this Directive are recorded, if a holder of a service record book requests the recording, and are validated for a period of up to 15 months before the request for validation. The Member States referred to in Article 39(3) shall inform the Commission, where relevant, of the inland waterways on their territory where competences for navigation of a maritime character are required.
