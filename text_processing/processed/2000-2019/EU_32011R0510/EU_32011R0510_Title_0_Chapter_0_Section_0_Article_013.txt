Article 13
Review and report
1.   By 1 January 2013, the Commission shall complete a review of the specific emissions targets in Annex I and of the derogations in Article 11, with the aim of defining:
—
subject to confirmation of its feasibility on the basis of updated impact assessment results, the modalities for reaching, by the year 2020, a long-term target of 147 g CO2/km in a cost-effective manner, and
—
the aspects of the implementation of that target, including the excess emissions premium.
On the basis of such a review and its impact assessment, which includes an overall assessment of the impact on the car industry and its dependent industries, the Commission shall, if appropriate, make a proposal to amend this Regulation, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, in a way which is as neutral as possible from the point of view of competition, and which is socially equitable and sustainable.
2.   The Commission shall, if appropriate, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council by 2014, to include in this Regulation vehicles in category N2 and M2 as defined in Annex II to Directive 2007/46/EC with a reference mass not exceeding 2 610 kg and vehicles to which type-approval is extended in accordance with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007, with a view to achieving the long-term target from 2020.
3.   The Commission shall by 2014, following an impact assessment, publish a report on the availability of data on footprint and payload and their use as utility parameters for determining specific emissions targets and, if appropriate, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council to amend Annex I in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
4.   By 31 December 2011 the Commission shall set up a procedure to obtain representative values of CO2 emissions, fuel efficiency and mass of completed vehicles while ensuring that the manufacturer of the base vehicle has timely access to the mass and to the specific emissions of CO2 of the completed vehicle.
5.   By 31 October 2016, and every three years thereafter, the Commission shall amend Annex I by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 15, and subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 16 and 17, to adjust the figure M0, referred to therein, to the average mass of new light commercial vehicles in the previous three calendar years.
Those adjustments shall take effect for the first time on 1 January 2018 and every three years thereafter.
6.   The Commission shall include light commercial vehicles in the review of the procedures for measuring CO2 emissions in accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009.
From the date of application of the revised procedure for the measuring of CO2 emissions, innovative technologies shall no longer be approved under the procedure set out in Article 12.
The Commission shall include light commercial vehicles in the review of Directive 2007/46/EC in accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009.
In order to reflect any change in the regulatory test procedure for the measurement of specific CO2 emissions, the Commission shall adapt the formulae set out in Annex I by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 15, and subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 16 and 17.
