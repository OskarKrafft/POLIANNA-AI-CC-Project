Article 3
Operational objectives
1.   Within the objective set out in Article 2(a) (integrated maritime governance) the Programme shall:
(a)
promote actions which encourage Member States and EU regions to develop, introduce or implement integrated maritime governance;
(b)
promote cross-sectoral cooperation platforms and networks, including representatives of public authorities, regional and local authorities, industry, research stakeholders, citizens, civil society organisations and the social partners;
(c)
enhance the visibility of, and raise the awareness of public authorities, the private sector and the general public, to an integrated approach to maritime affairs.
2.   Within the objective set out in Article 2(b) (cross-sectoral tools), the Programme shall foster the development of:
(a)
the Common Information Sharing Environment for the Union maritime domain which promotes cross-sectoral and cross-border surveillance information exchange interlinking all user communities, in line with the principles of the Integrated Maritime Surveillance so as to reinforce the safe, secure and sustainable use of maritime space, taking into account the relevant developments of sectoral policies as regards surveillance and contributing, as appropriate, to their necessary evolution;
(b)
maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal zone management, both important tools for the sustainable development of marine areas and coastal regions and both contributing to the aims of ecosystem-based management and the development of land-sea links, as well as facilitating Member State cooperation, for example as regards the development of experimental and other measures combining the generation of renewable energy and fish farming;
(c)
a comprehensive and publicly accessible high quality marine data and knowledge base which facilitates sharing, reuse and dissemination of these data and knowledge among various user groups using existing data, thus avoiding duplication of the databases; for this purpose, the best use shall be made of existing Union and Member State programmes, including INSPIRE (14) and GMES (15).
3.   Within the objective set out in Article 2(c) (protection of the marine environment) the Programme shall:
(a)
support the protection and preservation of the marine and coastal environment, as well as prevent and reduce inputs to the marine environment, including marine litter, with a view to phasing out pollution;
(b)
contribute to the health, biological diversity and resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems;
(c)
facilitate coordination between Member States and other actors in implementing the ecosystem-based approach to the management of human activities and the precautionary principle;
(d)
facilitate the development of methods and standards;
(e)
promote actions for the mitigation of the effects of, and adaptation to, climate change on the marine, coastal and insular environment, with a particular emphasis on those areas that are most vulnerable in that respect;
(f)
support the development of strategic approaches to research for the purpose of assessing the current state of ecosystems, thereby providing a basis for ecosystem-based management and planning at regional and national levels.
4.   Within the objective set out in Article 2(d) (sea-basin strategies), the Programme shall:
(a)
support the development and implementation of integrated sea-basin strategies, taking into account a balanced approach in all sea basins as well as the specificities of the sea basins and sub-sea basins, and of relevant macro-regional strategies where applicable, and especially those in which an exchange of information and experience between various countries is already established and operational multinational structures exist;
(b)
promote and facilitate the exploitation of synergies between the national, regional and Union levels, the sharing of information, including on methods and standards, and the exchange of best practices on maritime policy, including its governance and sectoral policies that have an impact on regional seas and coastal regions.
5.   Within the objective set out in Article 2(e) (international dimension) the Programme shall:
(a)
encourage continuing working in close cooperation with Member States on an integrated approach with third countries and actors in third countries sharing a sea basin with Member States of the Union, including on the ratification and implementation of UNCLOS;
(b)
encourage dialogue with third countries, taking into account UNCLOS and the relevant existing international conventions based on UNCLOS;
(c)
encourage the exchange of best practices complementing existing initiatives, taking into account the development of regional strategies at the sub-regional level.
This operational objective shall be pursued in coherence with the cooperation instruments of the Union, taking into account the objectives of the national and regional development strategies.
6.   Within the objective set out in Article 2(f) (growth, employment and innovation) the Programme shall:
(a)
promote initiatives for growth and employment in the maritime sectors and in coastal and insular regions;
(b)
promote training, education and career opportunities in maritime professions;
(c)
promote the development of green technologies, marine renewable energy sources, green shipping and short sea shipping;
(d)
promote the development of coastal, maritime and island tourism.
