Article 20
Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking and other markings
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the pyrotechnic articles. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the pyrotechnic article, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents.
2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the pyrotechnic article is placed on the market.

The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer.
4.   The CE marking and, where applicable, the identification number of the notified body may be followed by any other mark indicating a special risk or use.
5.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.
