Article 33
Operational obligations of notified bodies
1.   Notified bodies shall carry out conformity assessments in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures provided for in Annex II.
2.   Conformity assessments shall be carried out in a proportionate manner, avoiding unnecessary burdens for economic operators. Conformity assessment bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.
In so doing they shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for the compliance of the pyrotechnic article with the requirements of this Directive.
3.   Notified bodies carrying out conformity assessments shall assign registration numbers, identifying pyrotechnic articles which have been subject to a conformity assessment and their manufacturers, and shall maintain a register with the registration numbers of pyrotechnic articles for which they have issued certificates.
4.   Where a notified body finds that essential safety requirements set out in Annex I or corresponding harmonised standards or other technical specifications have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall require that manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue a certificate of conformity.
5.   Where, in the course of the monitoring of conformity following the issue of a certificate, a notified body finds that a pyrotechnic article no longer complies, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw the certificate if necessary.
6.   Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates, as appropriate.
