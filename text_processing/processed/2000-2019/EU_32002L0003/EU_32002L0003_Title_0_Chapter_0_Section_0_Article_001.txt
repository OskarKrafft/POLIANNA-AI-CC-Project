Article 1
Objectives
The purpose of this Directive is:
(a) to establish long-term objectives, target values, an alert threshold and an information threshold for concentrations of ozone in ambient air in the Community, designed to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment as a whole;
(b) to ensure that common methods and criteria are used to assess concentrations of ozone and, as appropriate, ozone precursors (oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds) in ambient air in the Member States;
(c) to ensure that adequate information is obtained on ambient levels of ozone and that it is made available to the public;
(d) to ensure that, with respect to ozone, ambient air quality is maintained where it is good, and improved in other cases;
(e) to promote increased cooperation between the Member States, in reducing ozone levels, use of the potential of transboundary measures and agreement on such measures.
