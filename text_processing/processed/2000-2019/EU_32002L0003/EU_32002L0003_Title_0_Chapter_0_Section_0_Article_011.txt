Article 11
Review and reporting
1. The Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council by 31 December 2004, at the latest, a report based on experience of the application of this Directive. It shall report, in particular, on:
(a) the findings of the most recent scientific research, in the light of the World Health Organisation's Guidelines, into the effects of exposure to ozone on the environment and human health, specifically taking into account sensitive population groups; the development of more accurate models shall be taken into account;
(b) technological developments, including progress achieved in methods of measuring and otherwise assessing concentrations and evolution of ozone concentrations throughout Europe;
(c) comparison of model predictions with actual measurements;
(d) the setting of, and levels for, long-term objectives, for target values, for information and alert thresholds;
(e) the results on the effects of ozone on crops and natural vegetation of the International Cooperative Programme under UN/ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution.
2. The report shall be presented as an integral part of an air quality strategy designed to review and propose Community air quality objectives and develop implementing strategies to ensure achievement of those objectives. In this context the report shall take into account:
(a) the broad scope for making further reductions in polluting emissions across all relevant sources, taking account of technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness;
(b) relationships between pollutants, and opportunities for combined strategies to achieve Community air quality and related objectives;
(c) the potential for further action to be taken at Community level in order to reduce precursor emissions;
(d) the progress in implementing the target values in Annex I, including the plans and programmes developed and implemented in accordance with Articles 3 and 4, the experience in implementing short-term action plans under Article 7 and the conditions, as laid down under Annex IV, under which air quality measurement has been carried out;
(e) the potential to achieve the long-term objectives, set out in Section III of Annex I, within a specified time period;
(f) current and future requirements for informing the public and for the exchange of information between Member States and the Commission;
(g) the relationship between this Directive and expected changes resulting from measures to be taken by the Community and Member States in order to fulfil commitments relating to climate change;
(h) transport of pollution across national boundaries taking account of measures taken in accession candidate countries.
3. The report shall also include a review of the provisions of this Directive in the light of its findings and it shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by proposals to amend this Directive, paying special attention to the effects of ozone on the environment and on human health, with particular reference to sensitive population groups.
