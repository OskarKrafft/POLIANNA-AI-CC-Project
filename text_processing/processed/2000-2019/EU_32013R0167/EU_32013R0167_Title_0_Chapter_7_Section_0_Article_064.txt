Article 64
Changes to designations
1.   Where a designating approval authority has ascertained or has been informed that a technical service designated by it no longer meets the requirements laid down in this Regulation, or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, the designating approval authority shall restrict, suspend or withdraw the designation as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations. The Member State that has notified this technical service shall immediately inform the Commission accordingly. The Commission shall modify the information published referred to in Article 63(6) accordingly.
2.   In the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of the designation, or where the technical service has ceased its activity, the designating approval authority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that technical service are either processed by another technical service or kept available for the designating approval authority or for the market surveillance authorities at their request.
