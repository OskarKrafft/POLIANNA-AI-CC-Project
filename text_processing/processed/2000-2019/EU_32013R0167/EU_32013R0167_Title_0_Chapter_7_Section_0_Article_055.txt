Article 55
Fees for access to vehicle repair and maintenance information
1.   Manufacturers may charge reasonable and proportionate fees for access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, working tools and training courses covered by this Regulation. A fee shall not be considered reasonable or proportionate if it discourages access by failing to take into account the extent to which the independent operator uses it.
2.   Manufacturers shall make available vehicle repair and maintenance information on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis, with fees for access to such information varying in accordance with the respective periods of time for which access is granted.
