Article 38
Making available on the market, registration or entry into service of vehicles
1.   Without prejudice to Articles 41 and 44, vehicles for which EU whole-vehicle type-approval is mandatory or for which the manufacturer has obtained such type-approval under this Regulation shall only be made available on the market, registered or enter into service if they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued in accordance with Article 33.
Where such vehicles are incomplete, making available on the market or entry into service of such vehicles is permitted, but the authorities responsible for vehicle registration of the Member States may refuse to allow the registration and use on the road of such vehicles.
2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to vehicles intended for use by the armed services, by civil defence, fire services and forces responsible for maintaining public order or to vehicles approved in accordance with Article 37.
