Article 73
Transitional provisions
1.   Without prejudice to other provisions of this Regulation, this Regulation shall not invalidate any EU type-approval granted to vehicles or to systems, components or separate technical units before 1 January 2016.
2.   Approval authorities shall continue to grant extension of approvals to the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units referred to in paragraph 1 in accordance with Directive 2003/37/EC and any of the directives listed in Article 76(1). However, such approvals shall not be used for the purposes of obtaining a whole-vehicle type-approval under this Regulation.
3.   By way of derogation from this Regulation, new systems, components, separate technical units or vehicles of types which received whole-vehicle type-approval pursuant to Directive 2003/37/EC may continue to be registered, placed on the market or enter into service until 31 December 2017. New vehicles of types which were not subject to type-approval under Directive 2003/37/EC may also continue to be registered or enter into service by that date in accordance with the law of the Member State of entry into service or registration.
In such a case, national authorities shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the registration, placing on the market or entry into service of vehicles complying with the approved type.
