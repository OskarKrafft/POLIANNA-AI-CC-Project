Article 29
General provisions
1.   The manufacturer shall inform without delay the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval of any change in the particulars recorded in the information package.
That approval authority shall decide which of the procedures laid down in Article 30 is to be followed.
Where necessary, the approval authority may decide, after consulting the manufacturer, that a new EU type-approval is to be granted.
2.   An application for the amendment of an EU type-approval shall be submitted exclusively to the approval authority that granted the original EU type-approval.
3.   If the approval authority finds that, for the purposes of making an amendment, inspections or tests need to be repeated, it shall inform the manufacturer accordingly.
The procedures referred to in Article 30 shall apply only if, on the basis of those inspections or tests, the approval authority concludes that the requirements for EU type-approval continue to be fulfilled.
