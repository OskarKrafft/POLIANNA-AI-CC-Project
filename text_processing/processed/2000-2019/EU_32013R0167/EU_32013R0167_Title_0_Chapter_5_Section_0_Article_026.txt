Article 26
Specific provisions concerning systems, components or separate technical units
1.   EU type-approval shall be granted in respect of a system which conforms to the particulars in the information folder and which meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant acts listed in Annex I.
2.   EU type-approval for a component or separate technical unit shall be granted in respect of a component or separate technical unit that conforms to the particulars in the information folder and which meets the technical requirements laid down in the relevant acts listed in Annex I.
3.   Where components or separate technical units, whether or not intended for repair, servicing or maintenance, are also covered by a system type-approval with respect to a vehicle, no additional component or separate technical unit approval shall be required unless provided for under the relevant acts listed in Annex I.
4.   Where a component or separate technical unit fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle, thereby making it possible to verify compliance with the requirements only when the component or separate technical unit is operating in conjunction with those other vehicle parts, the scope of the EU type-approval of the component or the separate technical unit shall be restricted accordingly.
In such cases, the EU type-approval certificate shall specify any restriction on the use of the component or separate technical unit and shall indicate the special conditions for its mounting.
Where such a component or separate technical unit is fitted by the vehicle manufacturer, compliance with any applicable restrictions on use or conditions for mounting shall be verified at the time when the vehicle is approved.
