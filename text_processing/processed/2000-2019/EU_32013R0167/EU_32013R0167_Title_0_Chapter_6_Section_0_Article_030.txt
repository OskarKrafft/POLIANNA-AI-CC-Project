Article 30
Revisions and extensions of EU type-approvals
1.   If particulars recorded in the information package have changed, without requiring inspections or tests to be repeated, the amendment shall be designated a ‘revision’.
In such cases, the approval authority shall issue the revised pages of the information package as necessary, marking each revised pages to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of reissue. A consolidated, updated version of the information package, accompanied by a detailed description of the changes, shall be deemed to meet that requirement.
2.   The amendment shall be designated an ‘extension’ when particulars recorded in the information package have changed and any of the following occurs:
(a)
further inspections or tests are required;
(b)
any information on the EU type-approval certificate, with the exception of its attachments, has changed;
(c)
new requirements under any act listed in Annex I become applicable to the approved vehicle type or to the approved system, component or separate technical unit.
In the event of an extension, the approval authority shall issue an updated EU type-approval certificate denoted by an extension number, incremented in accordance with the number of successive extensions already granted. That approval certificate shall clearly show the reason for the extension and the date of reissue.
3.   Whenever amended pages or a consolidated, updated version are issued, the index to the information package attached to the approval certificate shall be amended accordingly to show the date of the most recent extension or revision, or the date of the most recent consolidation of the updated version.
4.   No amendment to the type-approval of a vehicle shall be required if the new requirements referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 are, from a technical point of view, irrelevant to that type of vehicle or concern categories of vehicle other than the category to which it belongs.
