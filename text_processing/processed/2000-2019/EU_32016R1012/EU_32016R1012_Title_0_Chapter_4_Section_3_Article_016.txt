Article 16
Main section of breeding books
1.   Where different criteria or procedures are established by breed societies for entering purebred breeding animals in different classes, those breed societies may divide the main section of breeding books into classes:
(a)
according to the merits of those animals and subdivide those classes according to their age or gender; or
(b)
according to the age or gender of those animals, provided that those classes are also subdivided according to their merits.
Those criteria and procedures may require that the purebred breeding animal undergo the performance testing or genetic evaluation provided for in Article 25 or any other assessment described in the breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12 prior to it being entered in a specific class of the main section.
2.   Where the breeding programme establishes conditions for entry in the main section of the breeding book in addition to those set out in Chapter I of Part 1 of Annex II, the breed society carrying out that breeding programme shall establish, in that main section, at least one class for purebred breeding animals that fulfil only the conditions of Chapter I of Part 1 of Annex II and Article 21 to be entered, on application by the breeder.
