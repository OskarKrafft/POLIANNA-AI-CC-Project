Article 18
Entry of purebred breeding animals in the main section of the breeding book
1.   Breed societies shall, at the request of breeders, enter or register for entry in the main section of their breeding book any purebred breeding animals of the breed covered by their breeding programme, provided that those animals comply with the requirements set out in Chapter I of Part 1 of Annex II and, where applicable, that those animals are the offspring of breeding animals or result from the germinal products thereof, in accordance with the rules provided for in Article 21.
2.   Breed societies shall not refuse the entry in the main section of their breeding books of a purebred breeding animal on the grounds that it has already been entered in the main section of a breeding book of the same breed or, in the case of a cross-breeding programme carried out on purebred breeding animals of the equine species, of a different breed established by another breed society recognised in accordance with Article 4(3) or by a breeding body in a third country included in the list provided for in Article 34.
3.   Where the main section of the breeding book is divided into classes, purebred breeding animals meeting the criteria for entry in the main section shall be entered by the breed society in the class that corresponds to the merits of those purebred breeding animals.
