Article 21
Acceptance of purebred breeding animals and their germinal products for breeding
1.   A breed society carrying out a breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12 for a breed shall accept:
(a)
for natural service, any purebred breeding animal of that breed;
(b)
for artificial insemination, semen collected from purebred breeding animals of the bovine species which have undergone genetic evaluation in accordance with Article 25;
(c)
for artificial insemination, semen collected from purebred breeding animals of the porcine, ovine or caprine species which have undergone performance testing or genetic evaluation in accordance with Article 25;
(d)
for artificial insemination, semen collected from purebred breeding animals of the equine species which have undergone, where required by the breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12, performance testing or genetic evaluation in accordance with Article 25;
(e)
for embryo transfer, oocytes collected and used for in vitro production of embryos and in vivo derived embryos conceived by use of semen referred to in point (b) or (c) of this paragraph, provided that those oocytes and embryos have been collected from purebred breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine or caprine species which have undergone performance testing or genetic evaluation in accordance with Article 25;
(f)
for embryo transfer, oocytes collected and used for in vitro production of embryos and in vivo derived embryos conceived by use of semen referred to in point (d) of this paragraph, provided that those oocytes and embryos have been collected from purebred breeding animals of the equine species which have undergone, where required by the breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12, performance testing or genetic evaluation in accordance with Article 25;
(g)
for testing of male purebred breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine and caprine species, semen collected from purebred breeding animals which have not undergone performance testing or genetic evaluation provided that that semen is solely used for the purpose of testing those male purebred breeding animals within the quantity limits necessary to enable that breed society to carry out such tests in accordance with Article 25.
2.   In the case of purebred breeding animals of the equine species, by way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, a breed society may prohibit or limit the use of one or more reproduction techniques referred to in that paragraph or the use of purebred breeding animals for one or more of those reproduction techniques, including the use of their germinal products, provided that that prohibition or limitation is specified in its breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12.
Any such prohibition or limitation that is specified in the breeding programme of the breed society which has established the breeding book of the origin of the breed in accordance with point 3(a) of Part 3 of Annex I shall be binding for the breeding programmes of the breed societies that establish filial breeding books for the same breed in accordance with point 3(b) of Part 3 of Annex I.
3.   In the case of an endangered breed, a breed society may prohibit or restrict the use of a purebred breeding animal of that breed, including the use of its germinal products, where that use would compromise the preservation or the genetic diversity of that breed.
4.   Semen referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1 collected from male purebred breeding animals which are entered in the main section of a breeding book established by a breed society carrying out a breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12, shall be accepted by another breed society carrying out an approved breeding programme on the same breed in the same or another Member State under the same conditions and quantity limits for performance testing and, where applicable, genetic evaluation as those applied to its own male purebred breeding animals.
5.   For the purpose of paragraphs 1 and 4, the germinal products of purebred breeding animals referred to in those paragraphs shall be collected, produced, processed and stored at a semen collection or storage centre, or by an embryo collection or production team, approved for intra-Union trade in these commodities in accordance with Union animal health law.
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 5, a Member State may authorise the collection, production, processing and storage for use within the territory of that Member State of germinal products of purebred breeding animals at a semen collection or storage centre, at an embryo storage centre, by an embryo collection or production team or by specifically qualified staff, approved in accordance with the legislation of that Member State.
7.   By way of derogation from points (b), (c) and (e) of paragraph 1, where the aim of a breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12, is the preservation of the breed or the preservation of the genetic diversity existing within the breed, performance testing or genetic evaluation shall only be carried out where that breeding programme requires such performance testing or genetic evaluation.
