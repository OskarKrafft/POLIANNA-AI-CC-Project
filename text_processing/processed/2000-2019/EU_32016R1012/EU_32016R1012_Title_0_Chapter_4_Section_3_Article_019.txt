Article 19
Derogations from the requirements for the entry of animals in the main section of breeding books in the case of the creation of a new breed or the reconstruction of a breed
1.   By way of derogation from Article 18(1), where a breed society carries out a breeding programme approved in accordance with Article 8(3), and, where applicable, Article 12, for a breed for which no breeding book exists in any Member State or third country included in the list provided for in Article 34, that breed society may enter in the main section of that newly established breeding book, purebred breeding animals or descendants from purebred breeding animals of different breeds or any animal which is judged by the breed society to conform to the characteristics of that new breed and, where applicable, fulfils the minimum performance requirements laid down in the breeding programme.
Breed societies making use of this derogation shall:
(a)
set in their breeding programme a period for the establishment of the new breeding book that is appropriate for the generation interval of the species or the breed concerned;
(b)
make reference to any existing breeding book in which the purebred breeding animals or their parents have been entered for the first time after birth, together with the original registration number in that breeding book;
(c)
in their system for recording pedigrees, identify the animals which are considered by them to be the breed's foundation stock.
2.   Where a breed society intends to reconstruct a breed that has disappeared or that is in serious danger of disappearing, a Member State, or, if it so decides, the competent authority, may authorise the breed society to enter, in the main section of the breeding book, descendants of purebred breeding animals of the breed to be reconstructed or purebred breeding animals or descendants from purebred breeding animals of other breeds which enter in the reconstruction of that breed or any animal which is judged by the breed society to conform to the characteristics of the breed to be reconstructed and which, where applicable, fulfil the minimum performance requirements laid down in the breeding programme provided that:
(a)
a period for the establishment or re-establishment of that breeding book, appropriate for the breed concerned, is set in the breeding programme;
(b)
where applicable, reference is made to any breeding book in which those purebred breeding animals or ascendants have been entered together with the original registration number in that breeding book;
(c)
the animals which are considered by that breed society to be the breed's reconstruction stock are identified in the system for recording pedigrees.
3.   A breed society seeking to avail itself of the derogation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or the derogation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall lay down a detailed plan for the creation or reconstruction of the breed in its breeding programme referred to in Article 8(1).
4.   By the end of the periods referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article and point (a) of paragraph 2 of this Article, the competent authority shall carry out an official control as provided for in Article 43.
5.   Where a breed is being created or reconstructed in accordance with this Article, Member States shall make that information publicly available by including an indication to that effect in the list provided for in Article 7.
