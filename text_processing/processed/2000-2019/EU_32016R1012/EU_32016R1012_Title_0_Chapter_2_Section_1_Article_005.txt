Article 5
Refusal of recognition of breed societies and breeding operations
1.   For the purposes of Article 4(1), where the competent authority intends to refuse to recognise an applicant as a breed society or breeding operation, it shall provide that applicant with a reasoned explanation for doing so. That applicant shall have the right to request that the competent authority reconsider that intended refusal within 60 days from the date of receipt of the reasoned explanation, or earlier where national rules provide for shorter time-limits.
2.   Where, in the light of the reconsideration referred to in paragraph 1 the competent authority decides to confirm its refusal, it shall provide the applicant with a reasoned explanation of its decision to refuse recognition within 90 days from its receipt of the applicant's request for reconsideration, or earlier where national rules provide for shorter time-limits. At the same time, the competent authority shall inform the Commission of its decision to refuse recognition and of its reasons for doing so.
