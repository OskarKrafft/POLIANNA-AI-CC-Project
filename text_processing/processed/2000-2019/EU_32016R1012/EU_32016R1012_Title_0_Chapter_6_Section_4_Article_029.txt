Article 29
European Union reference centres
1.   Where there is a recognised need to promote the harmonisation or improvement of the methods of performance testing or genetic evaluation of purebred breeding animals used by breed societies or by third parties designated by breed societies in accordance with Article 27(1)(b), the Commission may adopt implementing acts, designating the European Union reference centres responsible for the scientific and technical contribution to the harmonisation or improvement of those methods.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).
2.   Where there is a recognised need to promote the establishment or harmonisation of the methods used by breed societies, third parties designated by breed societies in accordance with Article 27(1)(b), competent authorities or other authorities of the Member States for the preservation of endangered breeds or the preservation of the genetic diversity existing within those breeds, the Commission may adopt implementing acts, in order to designate the European Union reference centres responsible for the scientific and technical contribution to the establishment or harmonisation of those methods. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).
3.   The designations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall follow a public selection process and shall be limited in time or reviewed regularly.

the tasks of European Union reference centres set out in points 2 and 3 of Annex IV.
The delegated acts provided for in this paragraph shall take due account of:
(a)
the species of purebred breeding animals for which the methods of performance testing and genetic evaluation are to be harmonised or improved and the scientific and technical advances in the area of performance testing or genetic evaluation; or
(b)
the endangered breeds for which methods for the preservation of those breeds or the preservation of the genetic diversity within those breeds are to be established or harmonised and the scientific and technical advances in those areas.
6.   European Union reference centres designated in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 shall be subject to Commission controls to verify that:
(a)
they comply with the requirements set out in point 1 of Annex IV;
