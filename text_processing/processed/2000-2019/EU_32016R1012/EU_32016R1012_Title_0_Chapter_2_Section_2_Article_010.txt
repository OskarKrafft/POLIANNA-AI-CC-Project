Article 10
Derogations from Article 8(3) concerning the approval of breeding programmes
1.   By way of derogation from Article 8(3), the competent authority which has recognised a breed society in accordance with Article 4(3) may refuse to approve a breeding programme of that breed society that complies with the requirements set out in Part 2 of Annex I, and additionally in the case of purebred breeding animals of the equine species, in Part 3 of Annex I, on the grounds that that breeding programme would compromise the breeding programme carried out by another breed society for the same breed which has already been approved in that Member State as regards at least one of the following:
(a)
the essential traits of the breed characteristics or the main objectives of that breeding programme;
(b)
the preservation of that breed or of the genetic diversity within that breed; or
(c)
where the aim of that breeding programme is the preservation of that breed, the effective implementation of that breeding programme:
(i)
in the case of an endangered breed; or
(ii)
in the case of an autochthonous breed which is not commonly found in one or more of the territories of the Union.
2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, the competent authority shall take due account of the following:
(a)
the number of breeding programmes already approved for that breed in that Member State;
(b)
the size of the breeding populations covered by those breeding programmes;
(c)
the possible genetic input from breeding programmes carried out by other breed societies for the same breed in other Member States or by breeding bodies in third countries.
