Article 22
Methods for identity verification
1.   Where purebred breeding animals of the bovine, ovine, caprine and equine species are used for the collection of semen for artificial insemination, breed societies shall require that those purebred breeding animals are identified by analysis of their blood group or by any other appropriate method providing at least the same degree of certainty such as DNA analysis.
2.   Where breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species are used for the collection of oocytes and embryos, and where breeding animals of the porcine species are used for the collection of semen for artificial insemination, breed societies and breeding operations may require that those breeding animals are identified by one of the methods referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   At the request of a Member State or of a European association for breeding animals of the species concerned, the Commission may adopt implementing acts, approving methods for the verification of the identity of breeding animals provided that they offer at least the same degree of certainty as the analysis of the blood group of those breeding animals, taking into account technical advances and the recommendations of the European Union reference centres referred to in Article 29, ICAR or the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 62(2).
