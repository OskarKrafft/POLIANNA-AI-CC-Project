Information from Member States to the Commission
The supervisory authorities of the Member States shall inform the Commission and the supervisory authorities of the other Member States of any authorisation of a direct or indirect subsidiary, one or more of whose parent undertakings are governed by the laws of a third country.
That information shall also contain an indication of the structure of the group concerned.
Where an undertaking governed by the law of a third country acquires a holding in an insurance or reinsurance undertaking authorised in the Community which would turn that insurance or reinsurance undertaking into a subsidiary of that third country undertaking, the supervisory authorities of the home Member State shall inform the Commission and the supervisory authorities of the other Member States.
