Article 206
Health insurance as an alternative to social security
1.   Member States in which contracts covering the risks under class 2 in Part A of Annex I may serve as a partial or complete alternative to health cover provided by the statutory social security system may require that:
(a)
those contracts comply with the specific legal provisions adopted by that Member State to protect the general good in that class of insurance;
(b)
the general and special conditions of that insurance be communicated to the supervisory authorities of that Member State before use.
2.   Member States may require that the health insurance system referred to in paragraph 1 be operated on a technical basis similar to that of life insurance where all the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the premiums paid are calculated on the basis of sickness tables and other statistical data relevant to the Member State in which the risk is situated in accordance with the mathematical methods used in insurance;
(b)
a reserve is set up for increasing age;
(c)
the insurer may cancel the contract only within a fixed period determined by the Member State in which the risk is situated;
(d)
the contract provides that premiums may be increased or payments reduced, even for current contracts;
(e)
the contract provides that the policy holders may change their existing contract into a new contract complying with paragraph 1, offered by the same insurance undertaking or the same branch and taking account of their acquired rights.
In the case referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph, account shall be taken of the reserve for increasing age and a new medical examination may be required only for increased cover.
The supervisory authorities of the Member State concerned shall publish the sickness tables and other relevant statistical data referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph and transmit them to the supervisory authorities of the home Member State.
The premiums must be sufficient, on reasonable actuarial assumptions, for insurance undertakings to be able to meet all their commitments having regard to all aspects of their financial situation. The home Member State shall require the technical basis for the calculation of premiums to be communicated to its supervisory authorities before the product is circulated.
The third and fourth subparagraphs shall also apply where existing contracts are modified.
