Article 300
Revision of amounts expressed in euro
The amounts expressed in euro in this Directive shall be revised every five years, by increasing the base amount in euro by the percentage change in the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices of all Member States as published by Eurostat starting from 31 October 2012 until the date of revision and rounded up to a multiple of EUR 100 000.
If the percentage change since the previous revision is less than 5 %, the amounts will not be revised.
The Commission shall publish the revised amounts in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The revised amounts shall be implemented by Member States within 12 months of the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
