Freedom of investment
1.   Member States shall not require insurance and reinsurance undertakings to invest in particular categories of asset.
2.   Member States shall not subject the investment decisions of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking or its investment manager to any kind of prior approval or systematic notification requirements.
3.   This Article is without prejudice to Member States’ requirements restricting the types of assets or reference values to which policy benefits may be linked.
