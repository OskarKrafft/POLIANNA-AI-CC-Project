Article 21
Policy conditions and scales of premiums
1.   Member States shall not require the prior approval or systematic notification of general and special policy conditions, of scales of premiums, of the technical bases, used in particular for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions, or of forms and other printed documents which an undertaking intends to use in its dealings with policy holders or ceding or retro-ceding undertakings.
However, for life insurance and for the sole purpose of verifying compliance with national provisions concerning actuarial principles, the home Member State may require systematic notification of the technical bases used for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions. That requirement shall not constitute a prior condition for the authorisation of a life insurance undertaking.
2.   Member States shall not retain or introduce prior notification or approval of proposed increases in premium rates except as part of general price-control systems.
3.   Member States may subject undertakings seeking or having obtained authorisation for class 18 in Part A of Annex I to checks on their direct or indirect resources in staff and equipment, including the qualification of their medical teams and the quality of the equipment available to such undertakings to meet their commitments arising out of that class.
4.   Member States may maintain in force or introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions requiring approval of the memorandum and articles of association and communication of any other documents necessary for the normal exercise of supervision.
