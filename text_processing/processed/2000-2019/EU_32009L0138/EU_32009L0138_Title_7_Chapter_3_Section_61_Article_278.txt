Article 278
Representation of preferential claims by assets
Member States which choose the option set out in Article 275(1)(b) shall require every insurance undertaking to ensure that the claims which may take precedence over insurance claims pursuant to Article 275(1)(b) and which are registered in the insurance undertaking’s accounts are represented, at any moment and independently of a possible winding-up, by assets.
