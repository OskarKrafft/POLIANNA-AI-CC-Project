Article 263
Parent undertakings outside the Community: levels
Where the parent undertaking referred to in Article 260 is itself a subsidiary of an insurance holding company having its head office outside the Community or of a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, Member States shall apply the verification provided for in Article 260 only at the level of the ultimate parent undertaking which is a third-country insurance holding company, a third-country insurance undertaking or a third-country reinsurance undertaking.
However, Member States shall allow their supervisory authorities to decide, in the absence of equivalent supervision referred to in Article 260, to carry out a new verification at a lower level where a parent undertaking of insurance or reinsurance undertakings exists, whether a third-country insurance holding company, a third-country insurance undertaking or a third-country reinsurance undertaking.
In such a case, the supervisory authority referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 260(1) shall explain its decision to the group.
Article 262 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
