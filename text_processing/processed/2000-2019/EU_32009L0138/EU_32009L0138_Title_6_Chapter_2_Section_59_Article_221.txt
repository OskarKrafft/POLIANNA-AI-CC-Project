Article 221
Inclusion of proportional share
1.   The calculation of the group solvency shall take account of the proportional share held by the participating undertaking in its related undertakings.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the proportional share shall comprise either of the following:
(a)
where method 1 is used, the percentages used for the establishment of the consolidated accounts; or
(b)
where method 2 is used, the proportion of the subscribed capital that is held, directly or indirectly, by the participating undertaking.
However, regardless of the method used, where the related undertaking is a subsidiary undertaking and does not have sufficient eligible own funds to cover its Solvency Capital Requirement, the total solvency deficit of the subsidiary shall be taken into account.
Where in the opinion of the supervisory authorities, the responsibility of the parent undertaking owning a share of the capital is strictly limited to that share of the capital, the group supervisor may nevertheless allow for the solvency deficit of the subsidiary undertaking to be taken into account on a proportional basis.
2.   The group supervisor shall determine, after consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned and the group itself, the proportional share which shall be taken into account in the following cases:
(a)
where there are no capital ties between some of the undertakings in a group;
(b)
where a supervisory authority has determined that the holding, directly or indirectly, of voting rights or capital in an undertaking qualifies as a participation because, in its opinion, a significant influence is effectively exercised over that undertaking;
(c)
where a supervisory authority has determined that an undertaking is a parent undertaking of another because, in the opinion of that supervisory authority, it effectively exercises a dominant influence over that other undertaking.
