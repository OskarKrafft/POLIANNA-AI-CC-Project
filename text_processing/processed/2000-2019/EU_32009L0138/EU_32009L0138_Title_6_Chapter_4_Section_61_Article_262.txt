Article 262
Parent undertakings outside the Community: absence of equivalence
1.   In the absence of equivalent supervision referred to in Article 260, Member States shall apply to the insurance and reinsurance undertakings either Articles 218 to 258, mutatis mutandis and with the exception of Articles 236 to 243, or one of the methods set out in paragraph 2.
The general principles and methods set out in Articles 218 to 258 shall apply at the level of the insurance holding company, third-country insurance undertaking or third-country reinsurance undertaking.
For the sole purpose of the group solvency calculation, the parent undertaking shall be treated as if it were an insurance or reinsurance undertaking subject to the same conditions as laid down in Title I, Chapter VI, Section 3, Subsections 1, 2 and 3 as regards the own funds eligible for the Solvency Capital Requirement and to either of the following:
(a)
a Solvency Capital Requirement determined in accordance with the principles of Article 226 where it is an insurance holding company;
(b)
a Solvency Capital Requirement determined in accordance with the principles of Article 227, where it is a third-country insurance undertaking or a third-country reinsurance undertaking.
2.   Member States shall allow their supervisory authorities to apply other methods which ensure appropriate supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings in a group. Those methods must be agreed by the group supervisor, after consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned.
The supervisory authorities may in particular require the establishment of an insurance holding company which has its head office in the Community, and apply this Title to the insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the group headed by that insurance holding company.
The methods chosen shall allow the objectives of the group supervision as defined in this Title to be achieved and shall be notified to the other supervisory authorities concerned and the Commission.
