ArticleÂ 196
Cooperation on implementation
The Commission and the supervisory authorities of the Member States shall cooperate closely for the purposes of examining any difficulties which might arise in implementing this Section.
In the course of that cooperation they shall examine in particular any practices which might indicate that the leading insurance undertaking does not assume the role of the leader in co-insurance practice or that the risks clearly do not require the participation of two or more insurers for their coverage.
