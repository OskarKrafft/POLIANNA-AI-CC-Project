Article 75
Valuation of assets and liabilities
1.   Member States shall ensure that, unless otherwise stated, insurance and reinsurance undertakings value assets and liabilities as follows:
(a)
assets shall be valued at the amount for which they could be exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction;
(b)
liabilities shall be valued at the amount for which they could be transferred, or settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
When valuing liabilities under point (b), no adjustment to take account of the own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall be made.
2.   The Commission shall adopt implementing measures to set out the methods and assumptions to be used in the valuation of assets and liabilities as laid down in paragraph 1.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 301(3).
