Review
1.   By 31 October 2014, the Commission shall make an assessment of the application of Title III, in particular as regards the cooperation of supervisory authorities within, and functionality of, the college of supervisors, the legal status of CEIOPS, and the supervisory practices concerning setting the capital add-ons, and shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council, accompanied, where appropriate, by proposals for the amendment of this Directive.
2.   By 31 October 2015, the Commission shall make an assessment of the benefit of enhancing group supervision and capital management within a group of insurance or reinsurance undertakings including a reference to COM(2008)0119 and the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on this proposal of 16 October 2008 (A6-0413/2008).
