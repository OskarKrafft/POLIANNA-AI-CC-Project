Article 135
Implementing measures
1.   In order to ensure the uniform application of this Directive, the Commission may adopt implementing measures specifying qualitative requirements in the following areas:
(a)
the identification, measurement, monitoring, managing and reporting of risks arising from investments in relation to the first subparagraph of Article 132(2);
(b)
the identification, measurement monitoring, managing and reporting of specific risks arising from investment in derivative instruments and assets referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 132(4).
2.   In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency and to remove misalignment between the interests of firms that ‘repackage’ loans into tradable securities and other financial instruments (originators) and the interests of insurance or reinsurance undertakings that invest in such securities or instruments, the Commission shall adopt implementing measures laying down:
(a)
the requirements that need to be met by the originator in order for an insurance or reinsurance undertaking to be allowed to invest in such securities or instruments issued after 1 January 2011, including requirements that ensure that the originator retains a net economic interest of no less than 5 %;
(b)
qualitative requirements that must be met by insurance or reinsurance undertakings that invest in such securities or instruments.
3.   Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 301(3).
