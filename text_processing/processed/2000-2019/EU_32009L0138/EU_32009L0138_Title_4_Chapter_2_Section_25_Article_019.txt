ArticleÂ 19
Close links
Where close links exist between the insurance undertaking or reinsurance undertaking and other natural or legal persons, the supervisory authorities shall grant authorisation only if those links do not prevent the effective exercise of their supervisory functions.
The supervisory authorities shall refuse authorisation if the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a third country governing one or more natural or legal persons with which the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has close links, or difficulties involved in the enforcement of those measures, prevent the effective exercise of their supervisory functions.
The supervisory authorities shall require insurance and reinsurance undertakings to provide them with the information they require to monitor compliance with the conditions referred to in the first paragraph on a continuous basis.
