Article 101
Calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement
1.   The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.
2.   The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calculated on the presumption that the undertaking will pursue its business as a going concern.
3.   The Solvency Capital Requirement shall be calibrated so as to ensure that all quantifiable risks to which an insurance or reinsurance undertaking is exposed are taken into account. It shall cover existing business, as well as the new business expected to be written over the following 12 months. With respect to existing business, it shall cover only unexpected losses.
It shall correspond to the Value-at-Risk of the basic own funds of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking subject to a confidence level of 99,5 % over a one-year period.
4.   The Solvency Capital Requirement shall cover at least the following risks:
(a)
non-life underwriting risk;
(b)
life underwriting risk;
(c)
health underwriting risk;
(d)
market risk;
(e)
credit risk;
(f)
operational risk.
Operational risk as referred to in point (f) of the first subparagraph shall include legal risks, and exclude risks arising from strategic decisions, as well as reputation risks.
5.   When calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement, insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall take account of the effect of risk-mitigation techniques, provided that credit risk and other risks arising from the use of such techniques are properly reflected in the Solvency Capital Requirement.
