Article 115
Policy for changing the full and partial internal models
As part of the initial approval process of an internal model, the supervisory authorities shall approve the policy for changing the model of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may change their internal model in accordance with that policy.
The policy shall include a specification of minor and major changes to the internal model.
Major changes to the internal model, as well as changes to that policy, shall always be subject to prior supervisory approval, as laid down in Article 112.
Minor changes to the internal model shall not be subject to prior supervisory approval, insofar as they are developed in accordance with that policy.
