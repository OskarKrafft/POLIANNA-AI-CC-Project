Article 114
Implementing measures
The Commission shall adopt implementing measures setting out the following:
(1)
the procedure to be followed for the approval of an internal model;
(2)
the adaptations to be made to the standards set out in Articles 120 to 125 in order to take account of the limited scope of the application of the partial internal model.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 301(3).
