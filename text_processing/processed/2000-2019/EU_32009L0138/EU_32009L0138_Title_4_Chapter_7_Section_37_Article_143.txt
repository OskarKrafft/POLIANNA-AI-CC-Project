Article 143
Implementing measures
The Commission shall adopt implementing measures specifying the factors to be taken into account for the purpose of the application of Article 138(4) including the maximum appropriate period of time, expressed in total number of months, which shall be the same for all insurance and reinsurance undertakings as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 138(4).
Where it is necessary to enhance convergence, the Commission may adopt implementing measures laying down further specifications with respect to the recovery plan referred to in Article 138(2), the finance scheme referred to in Article 139(2) and with respect to Article 141, taking due care to avoid pro-cyclical effects.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 301(3).
