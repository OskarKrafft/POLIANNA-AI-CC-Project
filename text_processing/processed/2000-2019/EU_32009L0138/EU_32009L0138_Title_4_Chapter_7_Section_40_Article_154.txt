Article 154
Prior notification and prior approval
1.   The host Member State shall not adopt provisions requiring the prior approval or systematic notification of general and special policy conditions, scales of premiums, or, in the case of life insurance, the technical bases used in particular for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions, or the forms and other documents which an insurance undertaking intends to use in its dealings with policy holders.
2.   The host Member State shall only require an insurance undertaking that proposes to pursue insurance business within its territory to effect non-systematic notification of policy conditions and other documents for the purpose of verifying compliance with its national provisions concerning insurance contracts, and that requirement shall not constitute a prior condition for an insurance undertaking to pursue its business.
3.   The host Member State shall not retain or introduce a requirement for prior notification or approval of proposed increases in premium rates except as part of general price-control systems.
