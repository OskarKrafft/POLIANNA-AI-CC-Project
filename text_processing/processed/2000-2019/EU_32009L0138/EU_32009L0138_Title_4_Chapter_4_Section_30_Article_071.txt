Article 71
Supervisory convergence
1.   Member States shall ensure that the mandates of supervisory authorities take into account, in an appropriate way, a European Union dimension.
2.   Member States shall ensure that in the exercise of their duties supervisory authorities have regard to the convergence in respect of supervisory tools and supervisory practices in the application of the laws, regulations and administrative requirements adopted pursuant to this Directive. For that purpose, Member States shall ensure that the supervisory authorities participate in the activities of CEIOPS pursuant to Decision 2009/79/EC and take duly into account its guidelines and recommendations referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.
3.   CEIOPS shall, where necessary, provide for non-legally binding guidelines and recommendations concerning the implementation of the provisions of this Directive and its implementing measures in order to enhance the convergence of supervisory practices. In addition, CEIOPS shall report regularly and at least every two years to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the progress of the supervisory convergence in the Community.
