Article 150
Compulsory insurance on third party motor vehicle liability
1.   Where a non-life insurance undertaking, through an establishment situated in one Member State, covers a risk, other than carrier’s liability, classified under class 10 in Part A of Annex I which is situated in another Member State, the host Member State shall require that undertaking to become a member of and participate in the financing of its national bureau and its national guarantee fund.
2.   The financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made only in relation to risks, other than carrier’s liability, classified under class 10 in Part A of Annex I covered by way of provision of services. That contribution shall be calculated on the same basis as for non-life insurance undertakings covering those risks, through an establishment situated in that Member State.
The calculation shall be made by reference to the insurance undertakings’ premium income from that class in the host Member State or the number of risks in that class covered there.
3.   The host Member State may require an insurance undertaking providing services to comply with the rules in that Member State concerning the cover of aggravated risks, insofar as they apply to non-life insurance undertakings established in that State.
