Article 109
Simplifications in the standard formula
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use a simplified calculation for a specific sub-module or risk module where the nature, scale and complexity of the risks they face justifies it and where it would be disproportionate to require all insurance and reinsurance undertakings to apply the standardised calculation.
Simplified calculations shall be calibrated in accordance with Article 101(3).
