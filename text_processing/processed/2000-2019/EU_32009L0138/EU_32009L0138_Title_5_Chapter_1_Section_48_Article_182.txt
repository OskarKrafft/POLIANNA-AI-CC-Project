Article 182
Life insurance
Member States shall not require the prior approval or systematic notification of general and special policy conditions, scales of premiums, technical bases used in particular for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions or forms and other printed documents which a life insurance undertaking intends to use in its dealings with policy holders.
However, the home Member State may, for the sole purpose of verifying compliance with national provisions concerning actuarial principles, require systematic communication of the technical bases used in particular for calculating scales of premiums and technical provisions. Those requirements shall not constitute a prior condition for an insurance undertaking to pursue business.
