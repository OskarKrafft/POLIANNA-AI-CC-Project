Article 256
Group solvency and financial condition report
1.   Member States shall require participating insurance and reinsurance undertakings or insurance holding companies to disclose publicly, on an annual basis, a report on the solvency and financial condition at the level of the group. Articles 51 and 53 to 55 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
2.   Where a participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or an insurance holding company so decides, and subject to the agreement of the group supervisor, it may provide a single solvency and financial condition report which shall comprise the following:
(a)
the information at the level of the group which must be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 1;
(b)
the information for any of the subsidiaries within the group which must be individually identifiable and disclosed in accordance with Articles 51 and 53 to 55.
Before granting the agreement in accordance with the first subparagraph, the group supervisor shall consult and duly take into account any views and reservations of the members of the college of supervisors.
3.   Where the report referred to in paragraph 2 fails to include information which the supervisory authority having authorised a subsidiary within the group requires comparable undertakings to provide, and where the omission is material, the supervisory authority concerned shall have the power to require the subsidiary concerned to disclose the necessary additional information.
4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing measures further specifying the information which must be disclosed and the means by which this is to be achieved as regards the single solvency and financial condition report.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 301(3).
