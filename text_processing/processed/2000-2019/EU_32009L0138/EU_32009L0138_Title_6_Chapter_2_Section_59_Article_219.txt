Article 219
Frequency of calculation
1.   The group supervisor shall ensure that the calculations referred to in Article 218(2) and (3) are carried out at least annually, either by the participating insurance or reinsurance undertakings or by the insurance holding company.
The relevant data for and the results of that calculation shall be submitted to the group supervisor by the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking or, where the group is not headed by an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, by the insurance holding company or by the undertaking in the group identified by the group supervisor after consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned and the group itself.
2.   The insurance and reinsurance undertaking and the insurance holding company shall monitor the group Solvency Capital Requirement on an ongoing basis. Where the risk profile of the group deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying the last reported group Solvency Capital Requirement, the group Solvency Capital Requirement shall be recalculated without delay and reported to the group supervisor.
Where there is evidence to suggest that the risk profile of the group has altered significantly since the date on which the group Solvency Capital Requirement was last reported, the group supervisor may require a recalculation of the group Solvency Capital Requirement.
