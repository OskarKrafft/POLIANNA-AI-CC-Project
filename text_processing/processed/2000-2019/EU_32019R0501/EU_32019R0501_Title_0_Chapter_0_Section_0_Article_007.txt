Article 7
Equivalence of rights
1.   The Commission shall monitor the rights granted by the United Kingdom to Union road haulage operators and to Union coach and bus service operators and the conditions for their exercise.
2.   Where it determines that the rights granted by the United Kingdom to Union road haulage operators or to Union coach and bus service operators are not, de jure or de facto, equivalent to those granted to United Kingdom operators under this Regulation, or that those rights are not equally available to all Union road haulage operators or to Union coach and bus service operators, the Commission shall, without delay and in order to restore equivalence, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 11 to do the following:
(a)
suspend the application of Article 3(1) and (2) or Article 4(1) to (4) of this Regulation where no equivalent rights are granted to Union operators, or where the rights granted are minimal;
(b)
establish limits to the allowable capacity available to United Kingdom road haulage operators or United Kingdom coach and bus service operators or to the number of journeys, or to both; or
(c)
adopt operational restrictions related to the types of vehicles or conditions of circulation.
