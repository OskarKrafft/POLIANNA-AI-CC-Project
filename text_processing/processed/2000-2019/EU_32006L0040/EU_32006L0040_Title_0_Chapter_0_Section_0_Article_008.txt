Article 8
Review
1.   On the basis of progress in potential containment of emissions from, or replacement of, fluorinated greenhouse gases in air-conditioning systems fitted to motor vehicles, the Commission shall examine whether:
—
the present legislation should be extended to other categories of vehicles, in particular categories M2 and M3 as well as classes II and III of category N1 and
—
Community provisions concerning the global warming potential of fluorinated greenhouse gases should be amended; any changes should take account of technological and scientific developments and the need to respect industrial product planning timescales,
and shall publish a report by 4 July 2011. Where necessary, it shall present appropriate legislative proposals.
2.   Where a fluorinated greenhouse gas with a global warming potential higher than 150, which is not yet covered by the IPCC report referred to in Article 3(8), is included in a future report of the IPCC, the Commission shall assess whether it is appropriate to amend this Directive in order to include that gas. If the Commission considers it necessary, it shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC:
—
adopt the necessary measures and
—
define transition periods for the application of these measures. In doing so the Commission shall strike a balance between the need for an appropriate lead-time and the risk that the fluorinated greenhouse gas poses to the environment.
