Article 5
Type-approval
1.   With effect from six months from the date of adoption of a harmonised leakage detection test, Member States may not, on grounds relating to emissions from air conditioning systems:
(a)
refuse, in respect of a new type of vehicle, to grant EC type-approval, or national type approval; or
(b)
prohibit registration, sale or entry into service of new vehicles,
if the vehicle fitted with an air-conditioning system designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150 complies with the requirements of this Directive.
2.   With effect from 12 months from the date of adoption of a harmonised leakage detection test or 1 January 2007, whichever is later, Member States shall no longer grant EC type-approval or national type-approval for a type of vehicle fitted with an air-conditioning system designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, unless the rate of leakage from that system does not exceed 40 grams of fluorinated greenhouse gases per year for a single evaporator system, or 60 grams of fluorinated greenhouse gases per year for a dual evaporator system.
3.   With effect from 24 months from the date of adoption of a harmonised leakage detection test or 1 January 2008, whichever is later, in respect of new vehicles fitted with air-conditioning systems designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, unless the rate of leakage from that system does not exceed 40 grams of fluorinated greenhouse gases per year for a single evaporator system or 60 grams of fluorinated greenhouse gases per year for a dual evaporator system, Member States shall:
(a)
consider certificates of conformity to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC; and
(b)
refuse registration and prohibit sale and entry into service.
4.   With effect from 1 January 2011 Member States shall no longer grant EC type-approval or national type-approval for a type of vehicle fitted with an air conditioning system designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150.
5.   With effect from 1 January 2017, in respect of new vehicles which are fitted with an air-conditioning system designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, Member States shall:
(a)
consider certificates of conformity to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC; and
(b)
refuse registration and prohibit sale and entry into service.
6.   Without prejudice to relevant Community law, in particular Community rules on State aid and Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (13), Member States may promote the installation of air-conditioning systems which are efficient, innovative and further reduce the climate impact.
