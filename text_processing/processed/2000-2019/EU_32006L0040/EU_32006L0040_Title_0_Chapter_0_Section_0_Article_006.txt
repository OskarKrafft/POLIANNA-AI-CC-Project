Article 6
Retrofitting and refilling
1.   With effect from 1 January 2011, air-conditioning systems designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150 shall not be retrofitted to vehicles type-approved from that date. With effect from 1 January 2017, such air-conditioning systems shall not be retrofitted to any vehicles.
2.   Air-conditioning systems fitted to vehicles type-approved on or after 1 January 2011 shall not be filled with fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150. With effect from 1 January 2017 air conditioning systems in all vehicles shall not be filled with fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, with the exception of refilling of air-conditioning systems containing those gases, which have been fitted to vehicles before that date.
3.   Service providers offering service and repair for air-conditioning systems shall not fill such equipment with fluorinated greenhouse gases if an abnormal amount of the refrigerant has leaked from the system, until the necessary repair has been completed.
