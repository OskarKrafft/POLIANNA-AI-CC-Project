Article 9
Reporting and information
1. At three-year intervals Member States shall send a report to the Commission on the implementation of this Directive. The report shall be drawn up on the basis of a questionnaire or outline drafted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 6 of Directive 91/692/EEC(8) with a view to establishing databases on end-of life vehicles and their treatment. The report shall contain relevant information on possible changes in the structure of motor vehicle dealing and of the collection, dismantling, shredding, recovery and recycling industries, leading to any distortion of competition between or within Member States. The questionnaire or outline shall be sent to the Member States six months before the start of the period covered by the report. The report shall be made to the Commission within nine months of the end of the three-year period covered by it.
The first report shall cover the period of three years from 21 April 2002.
Based on the above information, the Commission shall publish a report on the implementation of this Directive within nine months of receiving the reports from the Member States.
2. Member States shall require in each case the relevant economic operators to publish information on:
- the design of vehicles and their components with a view to their recoverability and recyclability,
- the environmentally sound treatment of end-of life vehicles, in particular the removal of all fluids and dismantling,
- the development and optimisation of ways to reuse, recycle and recover end-of life vehicles and their components,
- the progress achieved with regard to recovery and recycling to reduce the waste to be disposed of and to increase the recovery and recycling rates.
The producer must make this information accessible to the prospective buyers of vehicles. It shall be included in promotional literature used in the marketing of the new vehicle.
