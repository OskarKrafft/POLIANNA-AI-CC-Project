Article 20
Restoration of the damaged ecosystems
1.   Member States shall carry out appropriate restoration measures to assist the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed by invasive alien species of Union concern unless a cost-benefit analysis demonstrates, on the basis of the available data and with reasonable certainty, that the costs of those measures will be high and disproportionate to the benefits of restoration.
2.   The restoration measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include at least the following:
(a)
measures to increase the ability of an ecosystem exposed to disturbance caused by the presence of invasive alien species of Union concern to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of disturbance;
(b)
measures to support the prevention of reinvasion following an eradication campaign.
