Article 4
List of invasive alien species of Union concern
1.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of implementing acts, a list of invasive alien species of Union concern ('the Union list'), on the basis of the criteria laid down in paragraph 3 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 27(2). The draft implementing acts shall be submitted to the Committee referred to in Article 27(1) by 2 January 2016.
2.   The Commission shall undertake a comprehensive review of the Union list at least every six years and shall, in the meantime, update it, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1 with:
(a)
the addition of new invasive alien species;
(b)
the removal of listed species if they no longer meet one or more of the criteria laid down in paragraph 3.
3.   Invasive alien species shall only be included on the Union list if they meet all of the following criteria:
(a)
they are found, based on available scientific evidence, to be alien to the territory of the Union excluding the outermost regions;
(b)
they are found, based on available scientific evidence, to be capable of establishing a viable population and spreading in the environment under current conditions and in foreseeable climate change conditions in one biogeographical region shared by more than two Member States or one marine subregion excluding their outermost regions;
(c)
they are, based on available scientific evidence, likely to have a significant adverse impact on biodiversity or the related ecosystem services, and may also have an adverse impact on human health or the economy;
(d)
it is demonstrated by a risk assessment carried out pursuant to Article 5(1) that concerted action at Union level is required to prevent their introduction, establishment or spread;
(e)
it is likely that the inclusion on the Union list will effectively prevent, minimise or mitigate their adverse impact.
4.   Member States may submit to the Commission requests for the inclusion of invasive alien species on the Union list. Those requests shall include all of the following:
(a)
the name of the species;
(b)
a risk assessment carried out in accordance with Article 5(1);
(c)
evidence that the criteria set out in paragraph 3 of this Article are met.
5.   The Union list shall make reference, where relevant, to the goods with which the invasive alien species are generally associated and their Combined Nomenclature codes as provided by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (22), indicating the categories of goods that shall be subject to official controls pursuant to Article 15 of this Regulation.
6.   When adopting or updating the Union list, the Commission shall apply the criteria set out in paragraph 3 with due consideration to the implementation cost for Member States, the cost of inaction, the cost-effectiveness and the socio-economic aspects. The Union list shall include as a priority those invasive alien species that:
(a)
are not yet present in the Union or are at an early stage of invasion and are most likely to have a significant adverse impact;
(b)
are already established in the Union and have the most significant adverse impact.
7.   When proposing the Union list, the Commission shall also justify that the objectives of this Regulation are better achieved by measures at Union level.
