Article 31
Transitional provisions for non-commercial owners
1.   By way of derogation from points (b) and (d) of Article 7(1), owners of companion animals not kept for commercial purposes that belong to the invasive alien species included on the Union list shall be allowed to keep them until the end of the animals' natural life, provided the following conditions are met:
(a)
the animals were kept before their inclusion on the Union list;
(b)
the animals are kept in contained holding and all appropriate measures are put in place to ensure that reproduction or escape are not possible.
2.   Competent authorities shall take all reasonable steps to inform non-commercial owners of the risks posed by keeping the animals referred to in paragraph 1 and of the measures to be taken to minimise the risk of reproducing and escaping through awareness-raising and education programmes organised by Member States.
3.   Non-commercial owners who cannot ensure that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are met, shall not be permitted to keep the animals concerned. Member States may offer them the possibility of having their animals taken from them. Where this occurs, due regard to animal welfare shall be given.
4.   The animals referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article may be kept by the establishments referred to in Article 8 or in facilities established by Member States for that purpose.
