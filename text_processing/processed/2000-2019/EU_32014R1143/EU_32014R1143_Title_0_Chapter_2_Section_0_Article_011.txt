Article 11
Invasive alien species of regional concern and species native to the Union
1.   Member States may identify, from their national list of invasive alien species of Member State concern established in accordance with Article 12, species native or non-native to the Union that require enhanced regional cooperation.
2.   At the request of the Member States involved, the Commission shall act to facilitate the cooperation and coordination among those Member States involved, in accordance with Article 22(1). Where necessary, based on the impact of certain invasive alien species on biodiversity and related ecosystem services as well as on human health and the economy and provided that it is thoroughly substantiated by a comprehensive analysis of the justification for an enhanced regional cooperation carried out by the requesting Member States, the Commission may require, by means of implementing acts, that the Member States concerned apply, mutatis mutandis, in their territory or part of it, Articles 13, 14 and 16, Article 17 notwithstanding Article 18, as well as apply Articles 19 and 20, as appropriate.
