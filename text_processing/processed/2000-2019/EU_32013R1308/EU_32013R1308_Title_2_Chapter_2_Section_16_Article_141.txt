Article 141
Carry-forward of surplus sugar
1.   Each undertaking may decide to carry forward all or part of its production in excess of its sugar quota, its isoglucose quota or its inulin syrup quota to be treated as part of the next marketing year's production. Without prejudice to paragraph 3, that decision shall be irrevocable.
2.   Undertakings which take the decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall:

inform the Member State concerned before a date to be determined by that Member State:
(i)
between 1 February and 31 August of the current marketing year for quantities of cane sugar being carried forward;
(ii)
between 1 February and 31 August of the current marketing year for other quantities of beet sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup being carried forward;
(b)
undertake to store such quantities at their own expense until the end of the current marketing year.
3.   If an undertaking's definitive production in the marketing year concerned was less than the estimate made when the decision in accordance with paragraph 1 was taken, the quantity carried forward may be adjusted retroactively by 31 October of the following marketing year at the latest.
4.   The quantities carried forward shall be deemed to be the first quantities produced under the quota of the following marketing year.
5.   Sugar stored in accordance with this Article during a marketing year may not be subject to any other storage measures provided for in Articles 16 or 130.
