Article 221
Measures to resolve specific problems
1.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts taking necessary and justifiable emergency measures to resolve specific problems. Those measures may derogate from the provisions of this Regulation only to an extent that is strictly necessary and for a period that is strictly necessary. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2).
2.   To resolve specific problems, and on duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, relating to situations likely to cause a rapid deterioration of production and market conditions which could be difficult to address if the adoption of measures were delayed, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 229(3).
3.   The Commission shall adopt measures under paragraph 1 or 2 only if it is not possible to adopt the required emergency measures in accordance with Article 219 or 220.
4.   Measures adopted under paragraph 1 or 2 shall remain in force for a period not exceeding twelve months. If after this period the specific problems that led to the adoption of those measures persist, the Commission may, in order to establish a permanent solution, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 regarding the matter or present appropriate legislative proposals.
5.   The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of any measure adopted under paragraph 1 or 2 within two working days of its adoption.
