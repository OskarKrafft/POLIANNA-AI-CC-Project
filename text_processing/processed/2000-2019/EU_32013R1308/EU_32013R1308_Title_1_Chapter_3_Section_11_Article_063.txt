Article 63
Safeguard mechanism for new plantings
1.   Member States shall make available each year authorisations for new plantings corresponding to 1 % of the total area actually planted with vines in their territory, as measured on 31 July of the previous year.
2.   Member States may:
(a)
apply at national level a lower percentage than the percentage set out in paragraph 1;
(b)
limit the issuing of authorisations at regional level, for specific areas eligible for the production of wines with a protected designation of origin, for areas eligible for the production of wines with a protected geographical indication, or for areas without a geographical indication.
3.   Any of the limitations referred to in paragraph 2 shall contribute to an orderly growth of vine plantings, shall be set above 0 %, and shall be justified on one or more of the following specific grounds:
(a)
the need to avoid a well-demonstrated risk of oversupply of wine products in relation to market prospects for those products, not exceeding what is necessary to satisfy this need;
(b)
the need to avoid a well-demonstrated risk of significant devaluation of a particular protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication.
4.   Member States shall make public any decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 2, which shall be duly justified. Member States shall notify the Commission forthwith of those decisions and justifications.
