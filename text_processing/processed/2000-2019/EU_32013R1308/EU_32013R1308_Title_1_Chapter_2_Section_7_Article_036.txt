Article 36
National framework and national strategy for operational programmes
1.   Member States shall establish a national framework containing general conditions relating to the environmental actions referred to in Article 33(5). That framework shall provide, in particular, that such actions are to meet the appropriate requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, in particular those set out in Article 3 thereof.
Member States shall submit their proposed framework to the Commission which, by means of implementing acts adopted without applying the procedure referred to in Article 229(2) or (3), may within three months of the submission require modifications if it finds that the proposal would not contribute to the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 191 TFEU and in the seventh Union environment action programme. Investments on individual holdings supported by operational programmes shall also respect those objectives.
2.   Each Member State shall establish a national strategy for sustainable operational programmes in the fruit and vegetable market. Such a strategy shall include:
(a)
an analysis of the situation in terms of strengths and weaknesses and the potential for development;
(b)
justification of the priorities chosen;
(c)
the objectives of operational programmes and instruments, and performance indicators;
(d)
assessment of operational programmes;
(e)
reporting obligations for producer organisations.
The national strategy shall also integrate the national framework referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to Member States which have no recognised producer organisations.
