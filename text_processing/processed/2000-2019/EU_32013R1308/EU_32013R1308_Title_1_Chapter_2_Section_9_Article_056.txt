Article 56
Delegated powers
1.   In order to ensure the effective and efficient use of Union funds for apiculture, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 on:
(a)
the avoidance of double funding between Member States' apiculture programmes and rural development programmes;
(b)
the basis for allocating the Union's financial contribution to each participating Member State, based, inter alia, on the total number of bee hives in the Union.
2.   In order to ensure that the Union aid scheme is adapted to the latest developments and that the measures covered are effective in improving the general conditions for the production and marketing of apiculture products, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 to update the list of measures referred to in Article 55(4) that may be included in Member States' apiculture programmes, by adding other measures or adapting those measures without deleting any of them. That update of the list of measures shall not affect national programmes adopted prior to the entry into force of the delegated act.
