Article 207
Relevant market
The definition of the relevant market is a tool to identify and define the boundaries of competition between undertakings, and shall be founded on two cumulative elements:
(a)
the relevant product market: for the purposes of this Chapter, "product market" means the market comprising all those products which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer by reason of the products' characteristics, their prices and their intended use;
(b)
the relevant geographic market: for the purposes of this Chapter, "geographic market" means the market comprising the area in which the undertakings concerned are involved in the supply of the relevant products, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas, particularly because the conditions of competition are appreciably different in those areas.
