Article 167
Marketing rules to improve and stabilise the operation of the common market in wines
1.   In order to improve and stabilise the operation of the common market in wines, including the grapes, musts and wines from which they derive, producer Member States may lay down marketing rules to regulate supply, particularly by way of decisions taken by interbranch organisations recognised under Articles 157 and 158.
Such rules shall be proportionate to the objective pursued and shall not:
(a)
relate to any transaction after the first marketing of the produce concerned;
(b)
allow for price fixing, including where prices are set for guidance or recommendation;
(c)
render unavailable an excessive proportion of the vintage that would otherwise be available;
(d)
provide scope for refusing to issue the national and Union certificates required for the circulation and marketing of wines where such marketing is in accordance with those rules.
2.   The rules provided for in paragraph 1 shall be brought to the attention of operators by being published in full in an official publication of the Member State concerned.
3.   Member States shall notify the Commission of any decisions taken under this Article.
