2.   Without prejudice to Article 100(3), as regards the use of particulars referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article for wines without a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication:
(a)
Member States shall introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions to ensure certification, approval and verification procedures so as to guarantee the veracity of the information concerned;
(b)
Member States may, on the basis of non-discriminatory and objective criteria and with due regard to fair competition, for wine produced from wine grape varieties on their territory, draw up lists of excluded wine grape varieties, in particular if:
(i)
there is a risk of confusion for consumers as to the true origin of the wine due to the fact that the wine grape variety forms an integral part of an existing protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication;
(ii)
checks would not be cost-effective due to the fact that the given wine grape variety represents a very small part of the Member State vineyard;
(c)
mixtures of wines from different Member States shall not give rise to labelling of the wine grape variety unless the Member States concerned agree otherwise and ensure the feasibility of the relevant certification, approval and verification procedures.
