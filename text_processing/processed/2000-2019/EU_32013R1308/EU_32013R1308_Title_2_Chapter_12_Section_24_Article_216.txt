Article 216
National payments for distillation of wine in cases of crisis
1.   Member States may make national payments to wine producers for the voluntary or mandatory distillation of wine in justified cases of crisis.
Those payments shall be proportionate and shall allow that crisis to be addressed.
The overall amount of payments available in a Member State in any given year for such payments shall not exceed 15 % of the globally available funds per Member State for that year as laid down in Annex VI.
2.   Member States wishing to make use of the national payments referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit a duly substantiated notification to the Commission. The Commission shall decide, without applying the procedure referred to in Article 229(2) or (3), whether the measure is approved and whether the payments may be made.
3.   The alcohol resulting from distillation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used exclusively for industrial or energy purposes so as to avoid any distortion of competition.
4.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down the measures necessary for the application of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2).
