Article 191
Derogations for imported products and special security in the wine sector
Derogations from point 5 of Section B or Section C of Part II of Annex VIII for imported products may be adopted in accordance with Article 43(2) TFEU, pursuant to the international obligations of the Union.
In the case of derogations from point 5 of Section B of Part II of Annex VIII, importers shall lodge a security for those products with the designated customs authorities at the time of release into free circulation. The security shall be released on the presentation of proof by the importer, to the satisfaction of the customs authorities of the Member State of release into free circulation, that:
(a)
the products have not benefited from the derogations; or,
(b)
if they have benefited from the derogations, the products have not been vinified, or if they have been vinified, the resulting products have been appropriately labelled.
The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down rules to ensure the uniform application of this Article, including on the amounts of the security and appropriate labelling. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2).
