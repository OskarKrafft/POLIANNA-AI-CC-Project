Article 102
Relationship with trade marks
1.   The registration of a trade mark that contains or consists of a protected designation of origin or a geographical indication which does not comply with the product specification concerned or the use of which falls under Article 103(2), and that relates to a product falling under one of the categories listed in Part II of Annex VII shall be:
(a)
refused if the application for registration of the trade mark is submitted after the date of submission of the application for protection of the designation of origin or geographical indication to the Commission and the designation of origin or geographical indication is subsequently protected; or
(b)
invalidated.
2.   Without prejudice to Article 101(2), a trade mark referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article which has been applied for, registered or established by use in good faith, if that possibility is provided for by the law concerned, in the territory of the Union either before the date of protection of the designation of origin or geographical indication in the country of origin, or before 1 January 1996, may continue to be used and renewed notwithstanding the protection of a designation of origin or geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the trade mark's invalidity or revocation exist under Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (31) or under Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 (32).
In such cases, the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication shall be permitted alongside the relevant trade marks.
