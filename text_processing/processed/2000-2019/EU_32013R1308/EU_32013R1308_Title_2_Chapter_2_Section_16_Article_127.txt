Delivery contracts
1.   In addition to the requirements set out in Article 125(1), agreements within the trade shall conform to the purchase terms laid down in Annex XI.
2.   In delivery contracts, a distinction shall be made depending on whether the quantities of sugar to be manufactured from sugar beet are:

quota sugar; or
(b)
out-of-quota sugar.
3.   Each sugar undertaking shall provide the Member State in which it produces sugar with the following information:
(a)
the quantities of beet referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 for which they have concluded pre-sowing delivery contracts and the sugar content on which those contracts are based;
(b)
the corresponding estimated yield.
Member States may require additional information.
4.   Sugar undertakings which have not signed pre-sowing delivery contracts at the minimum price for quota beet, as referred to in Article 135, for a quantity of beet equivalent to the sugar for which they hold a quota, adjusted, as the case may be, by the coefficient for a preventive withdrawal fixed pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 130(2), shall be required to pay at least the minimum price for quota beet for all the sugar beet they process into sugar.
5.   Subject to the approval of the Member State concerned, agreements within the trade may derogate from paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.
6.   If no agreements within the trade exist, the Member State concerned shall take the necessary steps compatible with this Regulation to protect the interests of the parties concerned.
