Article 41
Submission of support programmes
1.   Each producer Member State listed in Annex VI shall submit to the Commission a draft five-year support programme containing at least one of the eligible measures set out in Article 38.
2.   The support measures in the draft support programmes shall be drawn up at the geographical level which the Member State considers most appropriate. The Member State shall consult the competent authorities and organisations at the appropriate territorial level on the draft support programme before submitting it to the Commission.
3.   Each Member State shall submit a single draft support programme, which may take into account regional particularities.
4.   Support programmes shall become applicable three months after the submission of the draft support programme to the Commission.
However, the Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing that the submitted draft support programme does not comply with the rules laid down in this Section, and shall inform the Member State thereof. In such a case, the Member State shall submit a revised draft support programme to the Commission. The revised support programme shall become applicable two months after the submission of the draft revised support programme unless an incompatibility persists, in which case this subparagraph shall apply.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted without applying the procedure referred to in Article 229(2) or (3).
5.   Paragraph 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to changes in respect of applicable support programmes submitted by Member States.
