Article 77
Certification for hops
1.   In addition, where relevant, to the applicable marketing standards, products of the hops sector harvested or prepared within the Union shall be subject to a certification procedure under this Article.
2.   Certificates may be issued only for products having the minimum quality characteristics appropriate to a specific stage of marketing. In the case of hop powder, hop powder with higher lupulin content, extract of hops and mixed hop products, the certificate may only be issued if the alpha acid content of these products is not lower than that of the hops from which they have been prepared.
3.   The certificates shall at least indicate:
(a)
the place(s) of production of the hops;
(b)
the year(s) of harvesting; and
(c)
the variety or varieties.
4.   Products of the hops sector may be marketed or exported only if covered by a certificate issued in accordance with this Article.
In the case of imported products of the hops sector, the attestation provided for in Article 190(2) shall be deemed to be equivalent to that certificate.
5.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 laying down measures derogating from paragraph 4 of this Article:
(a)
in order to satisfy the trade requirements of certain third countries; or
(b)
for products intended for special uses.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall:
(i)
not prejudice the normal marketing of products for which the certificate has been issued; and
(ii)
be accompanied by guarantees intended to avoid any confusion with those products.
