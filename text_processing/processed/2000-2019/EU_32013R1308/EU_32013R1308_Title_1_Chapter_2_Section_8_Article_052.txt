2.   The aid shall be paid to distillers that process by-products of winemaking delivered for distillation into raw alcohol with an alcoholic strength of at least 92 % by volume.
Member States may make the granting of support conditional upon the lodging of a security by the beneficiary.

5.   The alcohol resulting from the supported distillation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used exclusively for industrial or energy purposes to avoid distortion of competition.
