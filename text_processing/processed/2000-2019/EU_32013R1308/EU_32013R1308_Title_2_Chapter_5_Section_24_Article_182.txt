Article 182
Additional import duties
1.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts determining the products of the cereals, rice, sugar, fruit and vegetables, processed fruit and vegetables, beef and veal, milk and milk products, pigmeat, sheepmeat and goatmeat, eggs, poultry and bananas sectors, as well as of grape juice and grape must, to which, when imported subject to the rate of duty laid down in the Common Customs Tariff, an additional import duty shall apply in order to prevent or counteract adverse effects on the Union market which may result from those imports, if:
(a)
the imports are made at a price below the level notified by the Union to the WTO (the trigger price); or
(b)
the volume of imports in any year exceeds a certain level (the trigger volume).
The trigger volume shall be based on market access opportunities defined as imports expressed as a percentage of the corresponding domestic consumption during the three previous years.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2).
2.   Additional import duties shall not be imposed where the imports are unlikely to disturb the Union market, or where the effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective.
3.   For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, import prices shall be determined on the basis of the c.i.f. import prices of the consignment under consideration. C.i.f. import prices shall be checked against the representative prices for the product on the world market or on the Union import market for that product.
4.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down the measures necessary for the application of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 229(2).
