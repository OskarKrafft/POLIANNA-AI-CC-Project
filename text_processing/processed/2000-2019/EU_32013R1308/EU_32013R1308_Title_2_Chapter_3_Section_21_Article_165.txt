Article 165
Financial contributions of non-members
Where rules of a recognised producer organisation, a recognised association of producer organisations or a recognised interbranch organisation are extended under Article 164 and the activities covered by those rules are in the general economic interest of economic operators whose activities relate to the products concerned, the Member State which has granted recognition may, after consulting the relevant stakeholders, decide that individual economic operators or groups which are not members of the organisation but which benefit from those activities shall pay the organisation all or part of the financial contributions paid by its members to the extent that such contributions are intended to cover costs directly incurred as a result of pursuing the activities in question.
