Article 83
National rules for certain products and sectors
1.   Notwithstanding Article 75(2), Member States may adopt or maintain national rules laying down different quality levels for spreadable fats. Such rules shall allow those quality levels to be assessed on the basis of criteria relating, in particular, to the raw materials used, the organoleptic characteristics of the products and their physical and microbiological stability.
Member States making use of the option provided for in the first subparagraph shall ensure that other Member States' products complying with the criteria laid down by those national rules may, in a non-discriminatory way, use terms which state that those criteria have been complied with.
2.   Member States may limit or prohibit the use of certain oenological practices and provide for more stringent rules for wines authorised under Union law produced in their territory with a view to reinforcing the preservation of the essential characteristics of wines with a protected designation of origin or a protected geographical indication and of sparkling wines and liqueur wines.
3.   Member States may allow the experimental use of unauthorised oenological practices.
4.   In order to ensure the correct and transparent application of this Article, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 setting out the conditions for the application of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, as well as the conditions for the holding, circulation and use of the products obtained from the experimental practices referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.
5.   Member States may only adopt or maintain additional national provisions on products covered by a Union marketing standard if those provisions comply with Union law, in particular the principle of free movement of goods, and subject to Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (28).
