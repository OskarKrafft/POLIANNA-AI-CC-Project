Article 12
Monitoring and evaluation of actions
1.   The Commission shall regularly monitor its actions and review progress made towards delivering expected results, covering outputs and outcomes. The Commission shall also evaluate the impact and effectiveness of its sectoral policies and actions and the effectiveness of programming, where appropriate by means of independent external evaluations. Proposals by the European Parliament or the Council for independent external evaluations shall be taken into due account. Evaluations shall be based on OECD-DAC good practice principles, seeking to ascertain whether the specific objectives, where applicable taking into account gender equality, have been met and to formulate recommendations with a view to improving future operations. Those evaluations shall be carried out on the basis of pre-defined, clear, transparent and, where appropriate, country-specific and measurable indicators.
2.   The Commission shall send its evaluation reports to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Member States through the relevant committee referred to in Article 16. Specific evaluations may be discussed in that committee at the request of Member States. The results shall feed back into programme design and resource allocation.
3.   The Commission shall, to an appropriate extent, associate all relevant stakeholders in the evaluation phase of the Union's assistance provided under this Regulation, and may, where appropriate, seek to undertake joint evaluations with the Member States and development partners.
4.   The report mentioned in Article 13 shall reflect the main lessons learnt and the follow-up to the recommendations of the evaluations carried out in previous years.
