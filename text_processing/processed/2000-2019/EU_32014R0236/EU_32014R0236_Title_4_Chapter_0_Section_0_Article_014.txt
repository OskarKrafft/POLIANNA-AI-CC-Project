Article 14
Climate action and biodiversity expenditure
An annual estimate of the overall spending related to climate action and biodiversity shall be made on the basis of the indicative programming documents adopted. The funding allocated in the context of the Instruments shall be subject to an annual tracking system based on the OECD methodology (‘Rio markers’), without excluding the use of more precise methodologies where these are available, integrated into the existing methodology for performance management of Union programmes, to quantify the expenditure related to climate action and biodiversity at the level of the action programmes and the individual and special measures referred to in Article 2(1), and recorded within evaluations and the annual report.
