Article 4
Eurostat shall not disclose data supplied to it pursuant to Article 1 which might, by their nature, be subject to commercial confidentiality. Such confidential statistical data transmitted to Eurostat shall be accessible only to officials of Eurostat and may be used only for statistical purposes.
The first paragraph shall not, however, prevent the publication of such data in an aggregated form which does not enable individual commercial transactions to be identified.
