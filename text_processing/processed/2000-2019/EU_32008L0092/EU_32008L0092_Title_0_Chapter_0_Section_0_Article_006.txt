Article 6
Where appropriate, the Commission shall make the necessary changes to Annexes I and II in the light of specific problems identified. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 7(2).
Such changes shall, however, cover only the technical features of Annexes I and II and shall not be of a nature such as to alter the general structure of the system.
