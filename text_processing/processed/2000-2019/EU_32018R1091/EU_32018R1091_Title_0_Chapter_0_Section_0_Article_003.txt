Article 3
Coverage
1.   The data required by this Regulation shall cover 98 % of the total UAA (excluding kitchen gardens) and 98 % of the livestock units of each Member State.
2.   In order to meet those requirements, Member States shall provide data representative of the agricultural holdings and common land agricultural units that meet at least one of the physical thresholds listed in Annex II with regard to the size of agricultural land or the number of livestock units.
3.   By way of exception, where the frame specified under paragraph 2 represents more than 98 % of the national agricultural production, measured by the Standard Output in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1198/2014 (15), Member States may, subject to prior approval by the Commission (Eurostat), establish higher physical or corresponding economic thresholds to reduce the frame, as long as the 98 % coverage of the total UAA (excluding kitchen gardens) and 98 % of the livestock units of the Member States is reached.
4.   Where the frame specified under paragraph 2 of this Article does not represent 98 % of the UAA and 98 % of the livestock units, Member States shall extend the frame in accordance with Article 6 by establishing lower thresholds than those referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, or by establishing additional thresholds, or both.
