Article 32
Operational obligations of notified bodies
1.   Notified bodies shall carry out conformity assessments in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures provided for in Annex IV.
2.   Conformity assessments shall be carried out in a proportionate manner, avoiding unnecessary burdens for economic operators. Notified bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.
In so doing they shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for the compliance of the EU fertilising product with this Regulation.
3.   Where a notified body finds that the requirements set out in Annex I, II or III, or corresponding harmonised standards, common specifications referred to in Article 14 or other technical specifications, have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall require that manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue a certificate or approval decision.
4.   Where, in the course of the monitoring of conformity following the issue of a certificate or an approval decision, a notified body finds that an EU fertilising product no longer complies, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw the certificate or the approval decision, if necessary.
5.   Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates or approval decisions, as appropriate.
