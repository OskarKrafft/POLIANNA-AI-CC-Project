(a)
the CE marking has been affixed in violation of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or of Article 18 of this Regulation;
(b)
the identification number of the notified body has been affixed in violation of Article 18 or has not been affixed, where required by Article 18;
(c)
the EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up or has not been drawn up correctly;
(d)

(e)
