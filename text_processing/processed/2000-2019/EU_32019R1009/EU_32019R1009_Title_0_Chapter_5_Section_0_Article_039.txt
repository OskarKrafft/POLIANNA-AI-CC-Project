Article 39
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 38(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act in the form of a decision determining whether the national measure is justified or not.
If the national measure is considered justified, the decision shall order all Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant EU fertilising product is withdrawn from their market, and to inform the Commission accordingly.
If the national measure is considered unjustified, the decision shall order the Member State concerned to withdraw that measure.
The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.
2.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the EU fertilising product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 38(5) of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the EU fertilising product is attributed to shortcomings in the common specifications referred to in point (c) of Article 38(5), the Commission shall, without delay, adopt implementing acts amending or repealing the common specifications concerned.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 45(3).
