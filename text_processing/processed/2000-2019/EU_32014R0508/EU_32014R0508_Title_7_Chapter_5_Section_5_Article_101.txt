Article 101
Suspension of payments
1.   In addition to Article 142 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the Commission may adopt implementing acts suspending all or part of the interim payments under the operational programme in the case of a serious non-compliance by a Member State with its obligations under the CFP, which is liable to affect the expenditure contained in a certified statement of expenditure for which the interim payment is requested.
2.   Prior to the suspension of an interim payment as referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act recognising that a Member State has failed to comply with its obligations under the CFP. Before the Commission adopts such an implementing act, it shall immediately inform the Member State concerned of such findings or reliable information and the Member State shall be given the opportunity to present its observations on the matter.
3.   The suspension of all or part of the interim payments related to the expenditure referred to in paragraph 1 covered by the payment claim shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and repetition of the serious non-compliance.
