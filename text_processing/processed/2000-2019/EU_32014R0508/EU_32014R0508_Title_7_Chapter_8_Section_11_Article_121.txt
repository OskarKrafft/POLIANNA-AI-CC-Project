Article 121
Protection of Union financial interests
1.   The Commission shall take appropriate measures to ensure that, when operations financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Union are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts wrongly paid and, where appropriate, by effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
2.   The Commission or its representatives and the Court of Auditors shall have the power of audit, both on the basis of documents and on-the-spot checks, over all beneficiaries, contractors and sub-contractors who have received Union funds.
The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by Union funding, in accordance with the procedures laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (40) and in Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, with a view to establishing whether fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity has occurred affecting the financial interests of the Union in connection with a grant agreement, grant decision or a contract concerning Union funding.
3.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 2, cooperation agreements with third countries and international organisations, grant agreements, grant decisions and contracts resulting from the implementation of this Regulation shall contain provisions expressly empowering the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct the audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections referred to in those paragraphs, in accordance with their respective competences.
