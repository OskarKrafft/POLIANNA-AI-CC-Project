Article 88
Voluntary financial contributions to international organisations
The EMFF may support the following types of operations in the area of international relations:
(a)
financial contributions provided to the United Nations organisations as well as voluntary funding provided to any international organisation active in the field of the Law of the Sea;
(b)
financial contributions to preparations for new international organisations or the preparation of new international treaties which are of interest to the Union;
(c)
financial contributions to work or programmes carried out by international organisations which are of special interest to the Union;
(d)
financial contributions to any activity (including working, informal or extraordinary meetings of contracting parties) which upholds the interests of the Union in international organisations and strengthens cooperation with its partners in those organisations. In that regard, when the presence of representatives of third countries in negotiations and meetings in international fora and organisations becomes necessary for the interests of the Union, the EMFF may bear the costs of their participation.
