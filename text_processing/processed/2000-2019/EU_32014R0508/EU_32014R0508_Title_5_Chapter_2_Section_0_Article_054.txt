Article 54
Aquaculture providing environmental services
1.   In order to foster the development of aquaculture providing environmental services, the EMFF may support:
(a)
aquaculture methods compatible with specific environmental needs and subject to specific management requirements resulting from the designation of NATURA 2000 areas in accordance with Directives 92/43/EEC and 2009/147/EC;
(b)
participation, in terms of costs directly related thereto, in ex-situ conservation and reproduction of aquatic animals, within the framework of conservation and biodiversity restoration programmes developed by public authorities, or under their supervision;
(c)
aquaculture operations which include conservation and improvement of the environment and of biodiversity, and management of the landscape and traditional features of aquaculture zones.
2.   Support under point (a) of paragraph 1 shall take the form of annual compensation for the additional costs incurred and/or income foregone as a result of management requirements in the areas concerned, related to the implementation of Directives 92/43/EEC or 2009/147/EC.
3.   Support under point (c) of paragraph 1 shall be granted only to beneficiaries who commit themselves for a minimum period of five years to aqua-environmental requirements that go beyond the mere application of Union and national law. The environmental benefits of the operation shall be demonstrated by a prior assessment conducted by competent bodies designated by the Member State, unless the environmental benefits of that operation are already recognised.
4.   Support under point (c) of paragraph 1 shall take the form of annual compensation for the additional costs incurred and/or income foregone.
