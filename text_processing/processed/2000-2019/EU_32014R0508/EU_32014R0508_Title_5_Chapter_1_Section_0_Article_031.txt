with an overall length of less than 24 metres;
(b)
which is equipped for sea fishing;
(c)
which is between 5 and 30 years old; and
(d)
which belongs to a fleet segment for which the report on fishing capacity, referred to in Article 22(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, has shown a balance with the fishing opportunities available to that segment.
