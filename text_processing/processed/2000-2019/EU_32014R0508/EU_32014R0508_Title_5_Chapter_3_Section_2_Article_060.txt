Article 60
Community–led local development strategies
1.   In order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in Article 59, community–led local development strategies shall:
(a)
maximise the participation of fishery and aquaculture sectors in the sustainable development of coastal and inland fisheries and aquaculture areas;
(b)
ensure that local communities fully exploit and benefit from the opportunities offered by maritime, coastal and inland water development and, in particular, help small and declining fishing ports to maximise their marine potential by developing a diversified infrastructure.
2.   The strategies shall be coherent with the opportunities and needs identified in the relevant area and the Union priorities set out in Article 6. Strategies may range from those which focus on fisheries to broader strategies directed at the diversification of fisheries areas. The strategies shall go beyond a mere collection of operations or juxtaposition of sectoral measures.
