Article 122
Audits
1.   Officials of the Commission and of the Court of Auditors, or their representatives, may carry out on-the-spot audits on operations financed by this Regulation at any time with a notice of at least ten working days, except in urgent cases, for a period of up to three years after the final payment made by the Commission.
2.   Officials of the Commission and of the Court of Auditors, or their representatives, duly empowered to carry out on-the-spot audits, shall have access to the books and all other documents, including documents and metadata drawn-up or received and recorded in an electronic format relating to expenditure financed under this Regulation.
3.   The powers of audit referred to in paragraph 2 shall not affect the application of national provisions which reserve certain acts for agents specifically designated by national legislation. Officials of the Commission and of the Court of Auditors, or their representatives, shall not take part, inter alia, in home visits or the formal questioning of persons within the framework of the national legislation of the Member State concerned. However, they shall have access to information thereby obtained.
4.   If any Union financial support granted under this Regulation is subsequently allocated to a third party as a final beneficiary, the initial beneficiary, being the recipient of the Union financial support, shall provide the Commission with all relevant information regarding the identity of that final beneficiary.
