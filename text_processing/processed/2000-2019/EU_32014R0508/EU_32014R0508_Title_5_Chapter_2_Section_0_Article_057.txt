(a)
natural disasters;
(b)
adverse climatic events;
(c)
sudden water quality and quantity changes for which the operator is not responsible;

diseases in aquaculture, failure or destruction of production facilities for which the operator is not responsible.
2.   The occurrence of the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 in aquaculture shall be formally recognised as such by the Member State concerned.
3.   Member States may, where appropriate, establish in advance criteria on the basis of which the formal recognition referred to in paragraph 2 shall be deemed to be granted.
4.   Support shall only be granted for aquaculture stock insurance contracts which cover economic losses, as referred to in paragraph 1, exceeding 30 % of the average annual turnover of the aquaculture farmer, calculated on the basis of the average turnover of the aquaculture farmer over the three calendar years preceding the year in which the economic losses occurred.
