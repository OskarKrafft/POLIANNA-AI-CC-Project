Article 42
Added value, product quality and use of unwanted catches
1.   In order to improve the added value or quality of the fish caught, the EMFF may support:
(a)
investments that add value to fishery products, in particular by allowing fishermen to carry out the processing, marketing and direct sale of their own catches;
(b)
innovative investments on board that improve the quality of the fishery products.
2.   The support referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall be conditional on the use of selective gears to minimise unwanted catches and shall only be granted to owners of Union fishing vessels that have carried out a fishing activity at sea for at least 60 days during the two calendar years preceding the date of submission of the application for support.
