Article 61
Fisheries local action groups
1.   For the purposes of the EMFF, the local action groups referred to in Article 32(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 shall be designated as Fisheries local action groups (FLAGs).
2.   The FLAGs shall propose a community–led local development strategy based on, at least, the elements set out in Article 60 of this Regulation and shall be responsible for its implementation.
3.   The FLAGs shall:
(a)
broadly reflect the main focus of their strategy and the socioeconomic composition of the area through a balanced representation of the main stakeholders, including private sector, public sector and civil society;
(b)
ensure a significant representation of the fisheries and/or aquaculture sectors.
4.   If the community–led local development strategy is supported by other Funds in addition to the EMFF, the selection body of the FLAGs for the EMFF supported projects shall also fulfil the requirements set out in paragraph 3.
5.   FLAGs may also carry out additional tasks going beyond the minimum tasks provided for in Article 34(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, where such tasks are delegated to them by the managing authority.
