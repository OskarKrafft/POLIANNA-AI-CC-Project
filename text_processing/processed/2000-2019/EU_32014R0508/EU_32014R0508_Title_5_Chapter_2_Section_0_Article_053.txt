(b)
the participation in the Union eco-management and audit schemes (EMAS) established by Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (35).
2.   Support shall only be granted to beneficiaries who commit themselves to participate in the EMAS for a minimum of three years or to comply with the requirements of organic production for a minimum of five years.
3.   Support shall take the form of compensation for a maximum of three years during the period of the conversion of the enterprise to organic production, or during the preparation for participation in the EMAS. Member States shall calculate that compensation on the basis of:
