Article 105
Financial corrections by the Commission
1.   In addition to the cases referred to in Article 22(7), Article 85 and Article 144(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts making financial corrections by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme if, after carrying out the necessary examination, it concludes that:
(a)
expenditure contained in a certified statement of expenditure is affected by cases in which the beneficiary does not respect the obligations referred to in Article 10(2) of this Regulation and has not been corrected by the Member State prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph;
(b)
expenditure contained in a certified statement of expenditure is affected by cases of serious non-compliance with the CFP rules by the Member State which have resulted in the suspension of payment under Article 101 of this Regulation and where the Member State concerned still fails to demonstrate that it has taken the necessary remedial action to ensure compliance with and the enforcement of applicable rules in the future.
2.   The Commission shall decide on the amount of the correction taking into account the nature, gravity, duration and repetition of the serious non-compliance by the Member State or beneficiary with the CFP rules and the importance of the EMFF contribution to the economic activity of the beneficiary concerned.
3.   Where it is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of expenditure linked to non-compliance with the CFP rules by the Member State, the Commission shall apply a flat rate or extrapolated financial correction in accordance with paragraph 4.
4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 126, determining the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied and the criteria for applying flat rates or extrapolated financial corrections.
