Article 23
Market opening and reciprocity
1. Member States shall ensure that the eligible customers are:
(a) until 1 July 2004, the eligible customers as specified in Article 18 of Directive 98/30/EC. Member States shall publish by 31 January each year the criteria for the definition of these eligible customers;
(b) from 1 July 2004, at the latest, all non-household customers;
(c) from 1 July 2007, all customers.
2. To avoid imbalance in the opening of gas markets:
(a) contracts for the supply with an eligible customer in the system of another Member State shall not be prohibited if the customer is eligible in both systems involved;
(b) in cases where transactions as described in point (a) are refused because the customer is eligible in only one of the two systems, the Commission may, taking into account the situation in the market and the common interest, oblige the refusing party to execute the requested supply, at the request of one of the Member States of the two systems.
