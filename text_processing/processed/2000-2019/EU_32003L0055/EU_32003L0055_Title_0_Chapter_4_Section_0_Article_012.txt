1. Each distribution system operator shall operate, maintain and develop under economic conditions a secure, reliable and efficient system, with due regard for the environment.
2. In any event, the distribution system operator shall not discriminate between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings.
3. Each distribution system operator shall provide any other distribution system operator, and/or any transmission, and/or LNG system operator, and/or storage system operator with sufficient information to ensure that the transport and storage of natural gas takes place in a manner compatible with the secure and efficient operation of the interconnected system.
4. Each distribution system operator shall provide system users with the information they need for efficient access to the system.
