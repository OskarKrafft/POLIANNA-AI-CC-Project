Article 24
Direct lines
1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable:
(a) natural gas undertakings established within their territory to supply the eligible customers through a direct line;
(b) any such eligible customer within their territory to be supplied through a direct line by natural gas undertakings.
2. In circumstances where an authorisation (e.g. licence, permission, concession, consent or approval) is required for the construction or operation of direct lines, the Member States or any competent authority they designate shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction or operation of such lines in their territory. These criteria shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.
3. Member States may make authorisations to construct a direct line subject either to the refusal of system access on the basis of Article 21 or to the opening of a dispute settlement procedure under Article 25.
