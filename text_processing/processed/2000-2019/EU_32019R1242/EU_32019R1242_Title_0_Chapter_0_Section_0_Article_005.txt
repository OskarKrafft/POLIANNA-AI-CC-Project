Article 5
Zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles
1.   Starting from 1 July 2020 and for each subsequent reporting period, the Commission shall determine for each manufacturer the zero- and low-emission factor for the preceding reporting period.
The zero- and low-emission factor shall take into account the number and the CO2 emissions of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles in the manufacturer’s fleet in a reporting period, including zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(1), as well as zero- and low-emission vocational vehicles and shall be determined in accordance with point 2.3 of Annex I.
2.   For the reporting periods 2019 to 2024, the zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles shall be counted as follows for the purposes of paragraph 1:
(a)
a zero-emission heavy-duty vehicle shall be counted as two vehicles; and
(b)
a low-emission heavy-duty vehicle shall be counted as up to two vehicles according to a function of its specific CO2 emissions and the low-emission threshold of the vehicle sub-group to which the vehicle belongs as defined in point 2.3.3 of Annex I.
The zero- and low-emission factor shall be determined in accordance with point 2.3.1 of Annex I.
3.   For the reporting periods from 2025, onwards the zero- and low-emission factor shall be determined on the basis of a 2 % benchmark in accordance with point 2.3.2 of Annex I.
4.   The zero- and low-emission factor shall reduce the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer by a maximum of 3 %. The contribution of the zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(1) to that factor shall reduce the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer by a maximum of 1,5 %.
