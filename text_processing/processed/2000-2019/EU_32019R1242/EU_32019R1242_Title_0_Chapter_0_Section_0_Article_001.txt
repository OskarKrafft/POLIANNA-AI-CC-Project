Article 1
Subject matter and objective
In order to contribute to achieving the Union’s target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % below 2005 levels in 2030 in the sectors covered by Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 and to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, this Regulation sets CO2 emission performance requirements for new heavy-duty vehicles whereby the specific CO2 emissions of the Union fleet of new heavy-duty vehicles shall be reduced compared to the reference CO2 emissions as follows:
(a)
for the reporting periods of the year 2025 onwards by 15 %;
(b)
for the reporting periods of the year 2030 onwards by 30 %, unless decided otherwise pursuant to the review referred to in Article 15.
The reference CO2 emissions shall be based on the monitoring data reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/956 for the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 (‘the reference period’), excluding vocational vehicles, and shall be calculated in accordance with point 3 of Annex I to this Regulation.
