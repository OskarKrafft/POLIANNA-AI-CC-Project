Article 11
Publication of data and manufacturer performance
1.   By 30 April each year, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, publish a list indicating:
(a)
from 1 July 2020, for each manufacturer, its average specific CO2 emissions in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 4;
(b)
from 1 July 2020, for each manufacturer, its zero- and low-emission factor in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 5(1);
(c)
from 1 July 2026, for each manufacturer, its specific CO2 emissions target for the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 6;
(d)
from 1 July 2020 until 30 June 2031, for each manufacturer, its CO2 emissions reduction trajectory, its emission credits and, from 1 July 2026 until 30 June 2031, its emission debts in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 7;
(e)
from 1 July 2026, for each manufacturer, its excess CO2 emissions in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 8(1);
(f)
from 1 July 2020, the average specific CO2 emissions of all new heavy-duty vehicles registered in the Union in the preceding reporting period.
The list to be published by 30 April 2021 shall include the reference CO2 emissions referred to in the second paragraph of Article 1.
2.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17 to adjust the reference CO2 emissions in accordance with the following:
(a)
where the mission profile weights or the payload values have been adjusted pursuant to point (b) or (c) of Article 14(1), by applying the procedure set out in point 1 of Annex II;
(b)
where adjustment factors have been determined pursuant to Article 14(2), by applying those adjustment factors to the reference CO2 emissions;
(c)
where an undue increase in the reference CO2 emissions has been determined in accordance with the methodology referred to in Article 10, by correcting the reference CO2 emissions by 30 April 2022.
The Commission shall publish the adjusted reference CO2 emissions values and shall apply those values for the calculation of the manufacturer specific CO2 emissions targets applicable in the reporting periods starting from the date of application of the delegated acts adjusting the values.
