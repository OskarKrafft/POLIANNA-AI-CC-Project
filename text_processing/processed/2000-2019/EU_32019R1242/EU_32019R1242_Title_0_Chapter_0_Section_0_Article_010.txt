Article 10
Assessment of reference CO2 emissions
In order to ensure the robustness and representativeness of the reference CO2 emissions as a basis for determining the Union fleet-wide CO2 emissions targets, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish the methodology for assessing the application of the conditions under which the reference CO2 emissions have been determined and establish the criteria to determine whether those emissions have been unduly increased and, if so, how they are to be corrected.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2).
