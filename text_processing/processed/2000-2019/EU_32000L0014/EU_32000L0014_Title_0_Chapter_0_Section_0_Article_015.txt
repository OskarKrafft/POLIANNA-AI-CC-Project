Article 15
Notified bodies
1. Member States shall appoint bodies under their jurisdiction to carry out or supervise the conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 14(1).
2. Member States shall appoint only such bodies which comply with the criteria set out in Annex IX. The fact that a body complies with the criteria of Annex IX to this Directive does not mean that a Member State is obliged to appoint that body.
3. Each Member State shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of the bodies which they have appointed, together with the specific tasks and examination procedures which these bodies have been appointed to carry out and the identification numbers assigned to them beforehand by the Commission.
4. The Commission shall publish a list of the notified bodies in the Official Journal of the European Communities along with their identification numbers and the tasks for which they have been appointed. The Commission shall ensure that the list is kept up to date.
5. A Member State must withdraw its notification if it finds that the body no longer meets the criteria referred to in Annex IX. It shall forthwith inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.
