Article 11
Marking
1. Equipment referred to in Article 2(1) placed on the market or put into service which complies with the provisions of this Directive shall bear the CE marking of conformity. The marking shall consist of the initials "CE". The form of the marking to be used is shown in Annex IV.
2. The CE marking shall be accompanied by the indication of the guaranteed sound power level. A model of this indication is given in Annex IV.
3. The CE marking of conformity and the indication of the guaranteed sound power level shall be affixed in a visible, legible and indelible form to each item of equipment.
4. The affixing of markings or inscriptions on the equipment which are likely to be misleading with regard to the meaning or the CE marking or to the indication of the guaranteed sound power level shall be prohibited. Any other marking may be affixed to the equipment, provided that the visibility and legibility of the CE marking and the indication of the guaranteed sound power level is not thereby reduced.
5. Where the equipment referred to in Article 2(1) is subject to other directives concerning other aspects and which also provide for the affixing of the CE marking, the marking shall indicate that such equipment also fulfils the provisions of those directives. However, should one or more of these directives allow the manufacturer, during a transitional period, to choose which arrangements to apply, the CE marking shall indicate that the equipment only fulfils the provisions of the directives applied by the manufacturer. In this case the particulars of those directives, as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, must be given in the documents, notices or instructions required by those directives and accompanying such equipment.
