Article 17
Regulation of use
The provisions of this Directive shall not prevent Member States' entitlement to lay down, in due observance of the Treaty:
- measures to regulate the use of equipment referred to in Article 2(1) in areas which they consider sensitive, including the possibility of restricting the working hours of the equipment,
- such requirements as they may deem necessary to ensure that persons are protected when using the equipment in question, provided that this does not mean that the equipment is modified in a way not specified in this Directive.
