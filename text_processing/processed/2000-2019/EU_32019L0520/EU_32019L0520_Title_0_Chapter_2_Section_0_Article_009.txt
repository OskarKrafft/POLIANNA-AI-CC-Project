Article 9
Accounting
Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that legal entities which provide toll services keep accounting records which make a clear distinction possible between the costs and revenues related to the provision of toll services and the costs and revenues related to other activities.Â The information on the costs and revenues related to the toll service provision shall be provided, upon request, to the relevant Conciliation Body or judicial body. Member States shall also take the measures necessary to ensure that cross subsidies between the activities performed in the role of toll service provider and other activities are not allowed.
