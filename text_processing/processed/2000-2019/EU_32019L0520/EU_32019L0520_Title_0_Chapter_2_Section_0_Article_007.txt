Article 7
Remuneration
1.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that EETS providers are entitled to be remunerated by the toll charger.
2.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the methodology for defining the remuneration of the EETS providers is transparent, non-discriminatory and identical for all EETS providers accredited to a given EETS domain. They shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the methodology is published as part of the commercial conditions in the EETS domain statement.
3.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that in EETS domains with a main service provider, the methodology for calculating the remuneration of EETS providers follows the same structure as the remuneration of comparable services provided by the main service provider. The amount of remuneration of EETS providers may differ from the remuneration of the main service provider provided that it is justified by:
(a)
the cost of specific requirements and obligations of the main service provider and not of the EETS providers; and
(b)
the need to deduct, from the remuneration of EETS providers, the fixed charges imposed by the toll charger based on the costs, for the toll charger, of providing, operating and maintaining an EETS compliant system in its toll domain, including the costs of accreditation, where such costs are not included in the toll.
