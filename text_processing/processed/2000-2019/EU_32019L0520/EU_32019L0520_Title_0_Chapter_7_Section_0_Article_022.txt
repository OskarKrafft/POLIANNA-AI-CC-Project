Article 22
Pilot toll systems
1.   To allow for EETS technical development, Member States may temporarily authorise, on limited parts of their toll domain and in parallel with the EETS compliant system, pilot toll systems incorporating new technologies or concepts which do not comply with one or more provisions of this Directive.
2.   EETS providers shall not be required to participate in pilot toll systems.
3.   Before starting a pilot toll system, the Member State concerned shall request the authorisation of the Commission. The Commission shall issue the authorisation or refuse it, in the form of a Decision, within six months from the moment it received the request. The Commission may refuse the authorisation if the pilot toll system could prejudice the correct functioning of the regular electronic road toll system or of the EETS. The initial period of such authorisation shall not exceed three years.
