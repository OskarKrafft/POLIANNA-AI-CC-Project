Article 14
Additional elements regarding EETS
1.   Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the interaction of EETS users with toll chargers as part of EETS is limited, where applicable, to the invoicing process in accordance with Article 6(4) and to enforcement processes. Interactions between EETS users and EETS providers, or their OBE, may be specific to each EETS provider, without compromising EETS interoperability.
2.   Member States may require that toll service providers, including EETS providers, at the request of the Member States authorities, provide traffic data in respect of their clients, subject to compliance with the applicable data protection rules. Such data shall only be used by the Member States for the purpose of traffic policies and enhancing traffic management and the data shall not be used to identify the clients.
3.   The Commission shall adopt, at the latest by 19 October 2019, implementing acts laying down the specifications of electronic interfaces between the interoperability constituents of toll chargers, EETS providers and EETS users, including, where applicable, the content of the messages exchanged between the actors through those interfaces. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 31(2).
