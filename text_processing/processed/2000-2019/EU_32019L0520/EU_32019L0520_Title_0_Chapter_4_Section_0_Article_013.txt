Article 13
Single continuous service
Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that EETS is provided to EETS users as a single continuous service.
This means that:
(a)
once the vehicle classification parameters, including the variable ones, have been stored or declared, or both, no further in-vehicle human intervention is required during a journey unless there is a modification to the vehicle's characteristics; and
(b)
human interaction with a particular piece of OBE stays the same whatever the EETS domain.
