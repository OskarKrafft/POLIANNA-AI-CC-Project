Article 10
Obligations of distributors
Member States shall ensure that:
(a)
when making an EEE available on the market, distributors act with due care in relation to the requirements applicable in particular by verifying that the EEE bears the CE marking, that it is accompanied by the required documents in a language which can be easily understood by consumers and other end-users in the Member State in which the EEE is to be made available on the market, and that the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the requirements set out in points (g) and (h) of Article 7 and in point (d) of Article 9;
(b)
where a distributor considers or has reason to believe that an EEE is not in conformity with Article 4, that distributor does not make the EEE available on the market until it has been brought into conformity, and that that distributor informs the manufacturer or the importer as well as the market surveillance authorities to that effect;
(c)
distributors who consider or have reason to believe that an EEE which they have made available on the market is not in conformity with this Directive make sure that the corrective measures necessary to bring that EEE into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, as appropriate, are taken and that they immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made the EEE available to that effect, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken;
(d)
distributors, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide it with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of EEE with this Directive, and that they cooperate with that authority, at its request, on any action taken to ensure the compliance with this Directive of the EEE which they have made available on the market.
