Article 13
EU declaration of conformity
1.   The EU declaration of conformity shall state that it has been demonstrated that the requirements specified in Article 4 have been met.
2.   The EU declaration of conformity shall have the model structure and shall contain the elements specified in Annex VI and shall be updated. It shall be translated into the language or languages required by the Member State on the market of which the product is placed or made available.
Where other applicable Union legislation requires the application of a conformity assessment procedure which is at least as stringent, compliance with the requirements of Article 4(1) of this Directive may be demonstrated within the context of that procedure. A single technical documentation may be drawn up.
3.   By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the manufacturer shall assume responsibility for the compliance of the EEE with this Directive.
