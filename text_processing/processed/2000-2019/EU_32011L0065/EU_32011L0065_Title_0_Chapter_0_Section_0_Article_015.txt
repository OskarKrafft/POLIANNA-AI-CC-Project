Article 15
Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the finished EEE or to its data plate. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the EEE, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents.
2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the EEE is placed on the market.
3.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure the correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and take appropriate action in the event of improper use of the CE marking. Member States shall also provide for penalties for infringements, which may include criminal sanctions for serious infringements. Those penalties shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and constitute an effective deterrent against improper use.
