Objective
1.   For the purpose of this Regulation, “industrialised and other high-income countries and territories” shall comprise countries and territories listed in Annex I to this Regulation and “developing countries” shall comprise countries falling under Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (*1) and listed in Annex II to this Regulation. They are together hereinafter referred to as “partner countries”.
Union financing under this Regulation shall support economic, financial, technical, cultural and academic cooperation with partner countries in the areas set out in Article 4, falling within its spheres of competence. This Regulation shall serve to finance measures which, in principle, do not fulfil the criteria for Official Development Assistance (“ODA criteria”) established by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD/DAC”).
2.   The primary objective of cooperation with partner countries shall be to provide a specific response to the need to strengthen links and to engage further with them on a bilateral, regional or multilateral basis in order to create a more favourable and transparent environment for the development of relations between the Union and partner countries in accordance with the principles guiding the Union’s external action as laid down in the Treaties. This refers amongst others to the promotion of democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, as well as the promotion of decent work and good governance, and the preservation of the environment, in order to contribute to progress and sustainable development processes in partner countries.
