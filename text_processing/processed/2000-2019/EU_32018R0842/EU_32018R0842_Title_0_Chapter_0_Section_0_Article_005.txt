Article 5
Flexibilities by means of borrowing, banking and transfer
1.   In respect of the years 2021 to 2025, a Member State may borrow a quantity of up to 10 % from its annual emission allocation for the following year.
2.   In respect of the years 2026 to 2029, a Member State may borrow a quantity of up to 5 % from its annual emission allocation for the following year.
3.   A Member State whose greenhouse gas emissions for a given year are below its annual emission allocation for that year, taking into account the use of flexibilities pursuant to this Article and Article 6, may:
(a)
in respect of the year 2021, bank that excess part of its annual emission allocation to subsequent years until 2030; and
(b)
in respect of the years 2022 to 2029, bank the excess part of its annual emission allocation up to a level of 30 % of its annual emission allocations up to that year to subsequent years until 2030.
4.   A Member State may transfer up to 5 % of its annual emission allocation for a given year to other Member States in respect of the years 2021 to 2025, and up to 10 % in respect of the years 2026 to 2030. The receiving Member State may use that quantity for compliance under Article 9 for the given year or for subsequent years until 2030.
5.   A Member State whose reviewed greenhouse gas emissions for a given year are below its annual emission allocation for that year, taking into account the use of flexibilities pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article and Article 6, may transfer that excess part of its annual emission allocation to other Member States. The receiving Member State may use that quantity for compliance under Article 9 for that year or for subsequent years until 2030.
6.   Member States may use revenues generated by transfers of annual emission allocations pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 to tackle climate change in the Union or in third countries. Member States shall inform the Commission of any actions taken pursuant to this paragraph.
7.   Any transfer of annual emission allocations pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 may be the result of a greenhouse gas mitigation project or programme carried out in the selling Member State and remunerated by the receiving Member State, provided that double counting is avoided and traceability is ensured.
8.   Member States may use credits from projects issued pursuant to Article 24a(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC for compliance under Article 9 of this Regulation without any quantitative limit, provided that double counting is avoided.
