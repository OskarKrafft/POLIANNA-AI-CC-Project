Article 6
Flexibility for certain Member States following reduction of EU ETS allowances
1.   The Member States listed in Annex II to this Regulation may have a limited cancellation of up to a maximum of 100 million EU ETS allowances collectively taken into account for their compliance under this Regulation. Such cancellation shall be made from the auctioning volumes of the Member State concerned pursuant to Article 10 of Directive 2003/87/EC.
2.   The EU ETS allowances taken into account under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be considered as EU ETS allowances in circulation for the purposes of Article 1(4) of Decision (EU) 2015/1814.
In its first review pursuant to Article 3 of that Decision, the Commission shall consider whether to maintain the accounting set out in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
3.   The Member States listed in Annex II shall notify the Commission by 31 December 2019 of any intention to make use of the limited cancellation of EU ETS allowances referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, up to the percentage listed in Annex II for each year of the period from 2021 to 2030 for each Member State concerned, for its compliance under Article 9.
The Member States listed in Annex II may decide to revise the notified percentage downwards once in 2024 and once in 2027. In such case, the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission thereof by 31 December 2024 or by 31 December 2027, respectively.
4.   At a Member State’s request, the Central Administrator designated pursuant to Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC (‘the Central Administrator’) shall take into account an amount up to the total quantity determined pursuant to Article 4(4) of this Regulation for that Member States’ compliance under Article 9 of this Regulation. One-tenth of the total quantity of EU ETS allowances determined pursuant to Article 4(4) of this Regulation shall be cancelled pursuant to Article 12(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC for each year from 2021 to 2030 for that Member State.
5.   Where a Member State, in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, has notified the Commission of its decision to revise the previously notified percentage downwards, a correspondingly lower quantity of EU ETS allowances shall be cancelled for that Member State in respect of each year from 2026 to 2030 or from 2028 to 2030, respectively.
