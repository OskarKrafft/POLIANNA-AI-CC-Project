Article 15
Review
1.   This Regulation shall be kept under review taking into account, inter alia, evolving national circumstances, the manner in which all sectors of the economy contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, international developments and efforts undertaken to achieve the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement.
2.   The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, within six months of each global stocktake agreed under Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, on the operation of this Regulation, including the balance between supply and demand for annual emission allocations, as well as on the contribution of this Regulation to the Union’s overall 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target and its contribution to the goals of the Paris Agreement, in particular with regard to the need for additional Union policies and measures in view of the necessary greenhouse gas emission reductions by the Union and its Member States, including a post-2030 framework, and may make proposals if appropriate.
Those reports shall take into account the strategies prepared pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 with a view to contributing to the formulation of a long-term Union strategy.
