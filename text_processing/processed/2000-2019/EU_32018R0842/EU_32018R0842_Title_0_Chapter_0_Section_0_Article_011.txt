Article 11
Safety reserve
1.   A safety reserve corresponding to a quantity of up to 105 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent shall be established in the Union Registry, subject to the fulfilment of the Union target referred to in Article 1. The safety reserve shall be available in addition to the flexibilities provided for in Articles 5, 6 and 7.
2.   A Member State may benefit from the safety reserve provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
its GDP per capita at market prices in 2013, as published by Eurostat in April 2016, was below the Union average;
(b)
its cumulative greenhouse gas emissions for the years from 2013 to 2020 in the sectors covered by this Regulation are below its cumulative annual emission allocations for the years from 2013 to 2020; and
(c)
its greenhouse gas emissions exceed its annual emission allocations in the period from 2026 to 2030, although it has:
(i)
exhausted the flexibilities pursuant to Article 5(2) and (3);
(ii)
made the maximum possible use of net removals according to Article 7, even if that quantity does not reach the level set in Annex III; and
(iii)
made no net transfers to other Member States under Article 5.
3.   A Member State, which meets the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall receive an additional quantity from the safety reserve up to its shortfall to be used for compliance under Article 9. That quantity shall not exceed 20 % of its overall overachievement in the period from 2013 to 2020.
If the resulting collective quantity to be received by all of the Member States which fulfil the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of this Article exceeds the limit referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the quantity to be received by each of those Member States shall be reduced on a pro rata basis.
4.   Any amount remaining in the safety reserve after the distribution in accordance with the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 shall be distributed among the Member States referred to in that subparagraph proportionally to their remaining shortfall, but not exceeding it. For each of those Member States, that quantity may be additional to the percentage referred to in that subparagraph.
5.   After the completion of the review referred to in Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 for the year 2020, the Commission shall, for each Member State that fulfils the conditions in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article, publish the amounts corresponding to 20 % of the overall overachievement in the period from 2013 to 2020 as referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 of this Article.
