3.   Member States shall ensure that their competent inventory authorities, where relevant:
(a)
make use of reporting systems established pursuant to Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 to improve the estimation of fluorinated gases in the national greenhouse gas inventories;
(b)
are able to undertake the annual consistency checks referred to in points (l) and (m) of Article 7(1).
4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to set out rules on the structure, format and submission process of the information relating to national inventory systems and to requirements on the establishment, operation and functioning of national inventory systems in accordance with relevant decisions adopted by the bodies of the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol or of agreements deriving from them or succeeding them.
