Article 10
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 9(4) and (5), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall, without delay, consult the Member State and the supplier or, where appropriate, the dealer and shall evaluate the national measure.
On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of an implementing act whether the national measure is justified or not and may suggest an appropriate alternative measure. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 18(2).
2.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the supplier or dealer concerned.
3.   If the national measure is considered to be justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered to be unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.
4.   Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 9(6) of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
5.   Corrective or restrictive measures pursuant to Article 9(2), (4), (5) or (9), or Article 10(3) shall be extended to all units of a non-compliant model and of its equivalent models, except those units for which the supplier demonstrates that they are compliant.
