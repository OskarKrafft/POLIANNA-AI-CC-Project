Article 15
Working plan
The Commission shall, after consulting the Consultation Forum referred to in Article 14, establish a long-term working plan which shall be made publicly available. The working plan shall set out an indicative list of product groups which are considered to be priorities for the adoption of delegated acts. The working plan shall also set out plans for the revision and rescaling of labels for product groups in accordance with Article 11(4) and (5), with the exception of the rescaling of labels which were in force at 1 August 2017 for which the rescaling is provided for in Article 11 of this Regulation.
The Commission shall update the working plan periodically after consulting the Consultation Forum. The working plan may be combined with the working plan required by Article 16 of Directive 2009/125/EC and shall be reviewed every three years.
The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council annually of the progress made in the implementation of the working plan.
