Article 13
Harmonised standards
1.   After the adoption of a delegated act pursuant to Article 16 of this Regulation setting specific labelling requirements the Commission shall, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, publish references to the harmonised standards that satisfy the relevant measurement and calculation requirements of the delegated act in the Official Journal of the European Union.
2.   Where such harmonised standards are applied during the conformity assessment of a product, the model shall be presumed to be in conformity with the relevant measurement and calculation requirements of the delegated act.
3.   Harmonised standards shall aim to simulate real-life usage as far as possible while maintaining a standard test method. Test methods shall furthermore take into account the associated costs for industry and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
4.   Measurement and calculation methods included in the harmonised standards shall be reliable, accurate and reproducible, and aligned with the requirements of Article 3(4) and (5).
