Article 12
Review
1.   By 1 January 2020, the Commission shall review progress in relation to the energy efficiency of medium combustion plants and assess the benefits of setting minimum energy efficiency standards in line with best available techniques.
2.   By 1 January 2023, the Commission shall assess the need to review the provisions concerning plants which are part of SIS or MIS, as well as Part 2 of Annex II, on the basis of state-of-the-art technologies.
As part of this review, the Commission shall also assess whether for certain or all types of medium combustion plants there is a need to regulate CO emissions.
Thereafter, a review shall take place every ten years and shall include an assessment of whether it is appropriate to set stricter emission limit values in particular for new medium combustion plants.
3.   The Commission shall submit a report on the results of the reviews referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 to the European Parliament and to the Council accompanied by a legislative proposal where appropriate.
