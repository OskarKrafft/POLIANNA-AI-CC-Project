Article 3
Definitions
For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply:
(1)
‘emission’ means the discharge of substances from a combustion plant into the air;
(2)
‘emission limit value’ means the permissible quantity of a substance contained in the waste gases from a combustion plant which may be discharged into the air during a given period;
(3)
‘nitrogen oxides’ (NOx) means nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, expressed as nitrogen dioxide (NO2);
(4)
‘dust’ means particles, of any shape, structure or density, dispersed in the gas phase at the sampling point conditions which may be collected by filtration under specified conditions after representative sampling of the gas to be analysed, and which remain upstream of the filter and on the filter after drying under specified conditions;
(5)
‘combustion plant’ means any technical apparatus in which fuels are oxidised in order to use the heat thus generated;
(6)
‘existing combustion plant’ means a combustion plant put into operation before 20 December 2018 or for which a permit was granted before 19 December 2017 pursuant to national legislation provided that the plant is put into operation no later than 20 December 2018;
(7)
‘new combustion plant’ means a combustion plant other than an existing combustion plant;
(8)
‘engine’ means a gas engine, diesel engine or dual fuel engine;
(9)
‘gas engine’ means an internal combustion engine which operates according to the Otto cycle and uses spark ignition to burn fuel;
(10)
‘diesel engine’ means an internal combustion engine which operates according to the Diesel cycle and uses compression ignition to burn fuel;
(11)
‘dual fuel engine’ means an internal combustion engine which uses compression ignition and operates according to the Diesel cycle when burning liquid fuels and according to the Otto cycle when burning gaseous fuels;
(12)
‘gas turbine’ means any rotating machine which converts thermal energy into mechanical work, consisting mainly of a compressor, a thermal device in which fuel is oxidised in order to heat the working fluid, and a turbine; this includes both open cycle and combined cycle gas turbines, and gas turbines in cogeneration mode, all with or without supplementary firing;
(13)
‘small isolated system’ (SIS) means a small isolated system as defined in point 26 of Article 2 of Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14);
(14)
‘micro isolated system’ (MIS) means a micro isolated system as defined in point 27 of Article 2 of Directive 2009/72/EC;
(15)
‘fuel’ means any solid, liquid or gaseous combustible material;
(16)
‘refinery fuel’ means solid, liquid or gaseous combustible material from the distillation and conversion steps of the refining of crude oil, including refinery fuel gas, syngas, refinery oils and pet coke;
(17)
‘waste’ means waste as defined in point 1 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (15);
(18)
‘biomass’ means any of the following:
(a)
products consisting of any vegetable matter from agriculture or forestry which can be used as a fuel for the purpose of recovering its energy content;
(b)
the following waste:
(i)
vegetable waste from agriculture and forestry;
(ii)
vegetable waste from the food processing industry, if the heat generated is recovered;
(iii)
fibrous vegetable waste from virgin pulp production and from production of paper from pulp, if it is co-incinerated at the place of production and the heat generated is recovered;
(iv)
cork waste;
(v)
wood waste with the exception of wood waste which may contain halogenated organic compounds or heavy metals as a result of treatment with wood preservatives or coating and which includes, in particular, such wood waste originating from construction and demolition waste;
(19)
‘gas oil’ means:
(a)
any petroleum-derived liquid fuel falling within CN codes 2710 19 25, 2710 19 29, 2710 19 47, 2710 19 48, 2710 20 17 or 2710 20 19; or
(b)
any petroleum-derived liquid fuel of which less than 65 % by volume (including losses) distils at 250 °C and of which at least 85 % by volume (including losses) distils at 350 °C by the ASTM D86 method;
(20)
‘natural gas’ means naturally occurring methane with no more than 20 % (by volume) of inerts and other constituents;
(21)
‘heavy fuel oil’ means:
(a)
any petroleum-derived liquid fuel falling within CN codes 2710 19 51 to 2710 19 68, 2710 20 31, 2710 20 35, or 2710 20 39; or
(b)
any petroleum-derived liquid fuel, other than gas oil as defined in point 19, which, by reason of its distillation limits, falls within the category of heavy oils intended for use as fuel and of which less than 65 % by volume (including losses) distils at 250 °C by the ASTM D86 method. If the distillation cannot be determined by the ASTM D86 method, the petroleum product is likewise categorised as a heavy fuel oil;
(22)
‘operating hours’ means the time, expressed in hours, during which a combustion plant is operating and discharging emissions into the air, excluding start-up and shut-down periods;
(23)
‘operator’ means any natural or legal person who operates or controls the combustion plant, or, where this is provided for in national law, to whom decisive economic power over the technical functioning of the plant has been delegated;
(24)
‘zone’ means part of the territory of a Member State, as delimited by that Member State for the purposes of air quality assessment and management, as laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC.
