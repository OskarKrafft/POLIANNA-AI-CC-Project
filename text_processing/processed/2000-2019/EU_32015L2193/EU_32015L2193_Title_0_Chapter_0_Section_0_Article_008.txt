Article 8
Compliance check
1.   Member States shall ensure that valid values for emissions monitored in accordance with Annex III do not exceed the emission limit values set out in Annex II.
2.   Member States shall set up an effective system, based on either environmental inspections or other measures, to check compliance with the requirements of this Directive.
3.   In the event of non-compliance, in addition to the measures taken by the operator under Article 7(7), Member States shall ensure that the competent authority requires the operator to take any measures necessary to ensure that compliance is restored without undue delay.
Where non-compliance causes a significant degradation of local air quality, the operation of the medium combustion plant shall be suspended until compliance is restored.
