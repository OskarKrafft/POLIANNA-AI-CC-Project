Article 9
Specific provisions relating to vehicle tyres, installation of tyres and tyre pressure monitoring systems
1.   All tyres provided as part of the equipment of a vehicle, including, where appropriate, any spare tyres, shall be suitable for use on the vehicles for which they are intended, particularly with regard to their dimensions, speed and load performance characteristics.
2.   Vehicles of category M1 shall be equipped with an accurate tyre pressure monitoring system capable of giving, when necessary, an in-car warning to the driver when a loss of pressure occurs in any tyre, in the interests of optimum fuel consumption and road safety. Appropriate limits in the technical specifications shall be set to achieve this, which shall furthermore allow for a technology-neutral and cost-effective approach in the development of accurate tyre pressure monitoring systems.
3.   All C1 tyres shall meet the wet grip requirements contained in Part A of Annex II.
4.   All tyres shall meet the rolling resistance requirements contained in Part B of Annex II.
5.   All tyres shall meet the rolling noise requirements contained in Part C of Annex II.
6.   Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall not apply to:
(a)
tyres whose speed rating is less than 80 km/h;
(b)
tyres whose nominal rim diameter does not exceed 254 mm or is 635 mm or more;
(c)
T-type temporary-use spare tyres;
(d)
tyres designed only to be fitted to vehicles registered for the first time before 1 October 1990;
(e)
tyres fitted with additional devices to improve traction properties.
7.   The requirements regarding rolling resistance and rolling noise set out in Parts B and C of Annex II shall not apply to off-road professional tyres.
