Article 8
Classification of tyres
1.   Tyres shall be classified as follows:
(a)   class C1 tyres— tyres designed primarily for vehicles of categories M1, N1, O1 and O2;
(b)   class C2 tyres— tyres designed primarily for vehicles of categories M2, M3, N, O3 and O4 with a load capacity index in single formation ≤ 121 and the speed category symbol ≥ ‘N’;
(c)   class C3 tyres— tyres designed primarily for vehicles of categories M2, M3, N, O3 and O4 with one of the following load capacity indices:
(i)
a load capacity index in single formation ≤ 121 and the speed category symbol ≤ ‘M’;
(ii)
a load capacity index in single formation ≥ 122.
A tyre may be classified in more than one class provided that it meets all the relevant requirements of each class in which it is classified.
2.   The list of load-capacity indices and their corresponding masses contained in UNECE Regulations 30 and 54 shall apply.
