Article 9
Compatibility with the Treaty
1.   Public service compensation for the operation of public passenger transport services or for complying with tariff obligations established through general rules paid in accordance with this Regulation shall be compatible with the common market. Such compensation shall be exempt from the prior notification requirement laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
2.   Without prejudice to Articles 73, 86, 87 and 88 of the Treaty, Member States may continue to grant aid for the transport sector pursuant to Article 73 of the Treaty which meets transport coordination needs or which represents reimbursement for the discharge of certain obligations inherent in the concept of a public service, other than those covered by this Regulation, and in particular:
(a)
until the entry into force of common rules on the allocation of infrastructure costs, where aid is granted to undertakings which have to bear expenditure relating to the infrastructure used by them, while other undertakings are not subject to a like burden. In determining the amount of aid thus granted, account shall be taken of the infrastructure costs which competing modes of transport do not have to bear;
(b)
where the purpose of the aid is to promote either research into, or development of, transport systems and technologies which are more economic for the Community in general.
Such aid shall be restricted to the research and development stage and may not cover the commercial exploitation of such transport systems and technologies.
