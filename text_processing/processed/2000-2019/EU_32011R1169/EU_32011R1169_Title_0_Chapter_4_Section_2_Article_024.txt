Article 24
Minimum durability date, ‘use by’ date and date of freezing
1.   In the case of foods which, from a microbiological point of view, are highly perishable and are therefore likely after a short period to constitute an immediate danger to human health, the date of minimum durability shall be replaced by the ‘use by’ date. After the ‘use by’ date a food shall be deemed to be unsafe in accordance with Article 14(2) to (5) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
2.   The appropriate date shall be expressed in accordance with Annex X.
3.   In order to ensure a uniform application of the manner of indicating the date of minimum durability referred to in point 1(c) of Annex X, the Commission may adopt implementing acts setting out rules in this regard. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 48(2).
