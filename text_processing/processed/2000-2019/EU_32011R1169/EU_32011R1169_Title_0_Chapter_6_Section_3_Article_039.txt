Article 39
National measures on additional mandatory particulars
1.   In addition to the mandatory particulars referred to in Article 9(1) and in Article 10, Member States may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 45, adopt measures requiring additional mandatory particulars for specific types or categories of foods, justified on grounds of at least one of the following:
(a)
the protection of public health;
(b)
the protection of consumers;
(c)
the prevention of fraud;
(d)
the protection of industrial and commercial property rights, indications of provenance, registered designations of origin and the prevention of unfair competition.
2.   By means of paragraph 1, Member States may introduce measures concerning the mandatory indication of the country of origin or place of provenance of foods only where there is a proven link between certain qualities of the food and its origin or provenance. When notifying such measures to the Commission, Member States shall provide evidence that the majority of consumers attach significant value to the provision of that information.
