Article 22
Quantitative indication of ingredients
1.   The indication of the quantity of an ingredient or category of ingredients used in the manufacture or preparation of a food shall be required where the ingredient or category of ingredients concerned:
(a)
appears in the name of the food or is usually associated with that name by the consumer;
(b)
is emphasised on the labelling in words, pictures or graphics; or
(c)
is essential to characterise a food and to distinguish it from products with which it might be confused because of its name or appearance.
2.   Technical rules for applying paragraph 1, including specific cases where the quantitative indication shall not be required in respect of certain ingredients, are laid down in Annex VIII.
