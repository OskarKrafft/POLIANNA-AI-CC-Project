Article 12
Availability and placement of mandatory food information
1.   Mandatory food information shall be available and shall be easily accessible, in accordance with this Regulation, for all foods.
2.   In the case of prepacked food, mandatory food information shall appear directly on the package or on a label attached thereto.
3.   In order to ensure that consumers benefit from other means of provision of mandatory food information better adapted for certain mandatory particulars, and provided that the same level of information as by means of the package or the label is ensured, the Commission, taking into account evidence of uniform consumer understanding and of the wide use of these means by consumers, may establish, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 51, criteria subject to which certain mandatory particulars may be expressed by means other than on the package or on the label.
4.   For the purposes of ensuring the uniform implementation of paragraph 3 of this Article, the Commission may adopt implementing acts on the modalities of application of the criteria referred to in paragraph 3 in order to express certain mandatory particulars by means other than on the package or on the label. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 48(2).
5.   In the case of non-prepacked food, the provisions of Article 44 shall apply.
