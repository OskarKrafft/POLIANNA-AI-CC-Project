Article 29
Retention period of alerts
1.   Alerts entered in SIS II pursuant to this Regulation shall be kept only for the time required to achieve the purposes for which they were entered.
2.   A Member State issuing an alert shall, within three years of its entry in SIS II, review the need to keep it.
3.   Each Member State shall, where appropriate, set shorter review periods in accordance with its national law.
4.   Within the review period, a Member State issuing an alert may, following a comprehensive individual assessment, which shall be recorded, decide to keep the alert longer, should this prove necessary for the purposes for which the alert was issued. In such a case, paragraph 2 shall apply also to the extension. Any extension of an alert shall be communicated to CS-SIS.
5.   Alerts shall automatically be erased after the review period referred to in paragraph 2 except where the Member State issuing the alert has communicated the extension of the alert to CS-SIS pursuant to paragraph 4. CS-SIS shall automatically inform the Member States of the scheduled deletion of data from the system four months in advance.
6.   Member States shall keep statistics about the number of alerts the retention period of which has been extended in accordance with paragraph 4.
