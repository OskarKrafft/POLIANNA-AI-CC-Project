Article 4
Control of the placing on the market and use of controlled substances
1. Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, the placing on the market and the use of the following controlled substances shall be prohibited:
(a) chlorofluorocarbons;
(b) other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons;
(c) halons;
(d) carbon tetrachloride;
(e) 1,1,1-trichloroethane; and
(f) hydrobromofluorocarbons.
The Commission may, following a request by a competent authority of a Member State and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), authorise a temporary exemption to allow the use of chlorofluorocarbons until 31 December 2004 in delivery mechanisms for hermetically sealed devices designed for implantation in the human body for delivery of measured doses of medication, and until 31 December 2008, in existing military applications, where it is demonstrated that, for a particular use, technically and economically feasible alternative substances or technologies are not available or cannot be used.
2. (i) Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, each producer and importer shall ensure that:
(a) the calculated level of methyl bromide which it places on the market or uses for its own account in the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed 75 % of the calculated level of methyl bromide which it placed on the market or used for its own account in 1991;
(b) the calculated level of methyl bromide which it places on the market or uses for its own account in the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed 40 % of the calculated level of methyl bromide which it placed on the market or used for its own account in 1991;
(c) the calculated level of methyl bromide which it places on the market or uses for its own account in the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed 25 % of the calculated level of methyl bromide which it placed on the market or used for its own account in 1991;
(d) it does not place any methyl bromide on the market or use any for its own account after 31 December 2004.
To the extent permitted by the Protocol, the Commission shall, following a request by a competent authority of a Member State and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), adjust the calculated level of methyl bromide referred to in Article 3(2) (i) (c) and subparagraph (c) where it is demonstrated that this is necessary to meet the needs of that Member State, because technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health are not available or cannot be used.
The Commission, in consultation with Member States, shall encourage the development, including research, and the use of alternatives to methyl bromide as soon as possible.
(ii) Subject to paragraph 4, the placing on the market and the use of methyl bromide by undertakings other than producers and importers shall be prohibited after 31 December 2005.
(iii) The calculated levels referred to in subparagraphs (i) (a), (b), (c) and (d) and (ii) shall not include the amount of methyl bromide produced or imported for quarantine and preshipment applications. For the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001 and for each 12-month period thereafter, each producer and importer shall ensure that the calculated level of methyl bromide which it places on the market or uses for its own account for quarantine and preshipment applications shall not exceed the average of the calculated level of methyl bromide which it placed on the market or used for its own account for quarantine and preshipment in the years 1996, 1997 and 1998.
Each year Member States shall report to the Commission the quantities of methyl bromide authorised for quarantine and preshipment used in their territory, the purposes for which methyl bromide was used, and the progress in evaluating and using alternatives.
The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), take measures to reduce the calculated level of methyl bromide which producers and importers may place on the market or use for their own account for quarantine and preshipment in the light of technical and economic availability of alternative substances or technologies and of the relevant international developments under the Protocol.
(iv) The total quantitative limits for the placing on the market or use for their own account by producers and importers of methyl bromide are set out in Annex III.
3. (i) Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5 and to Article 5(5):
(a) the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 and in the 12-month period thereafter shall not exceed the sum of:
- 2,6 % of the calculated level of chlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers placed on the market or used for their own account in 1989, and
- the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers placed on the market or used for their own account in 1989;
(b) the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001 shall not exceed the sum of:
- 2,0 % of the calculated level of chlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers placed on the market or used for their own account in 1989, and
- the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers placed on the market or used for their own account in 1989;
(c) the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002 shall not exceed 85 % of the level calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b);
(d) the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 shall not exceed 45 % of the level calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b);
(e) the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 and in each 12-month period thereafter shall not exceed 30 % of the level calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b);
(f) the calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008 and in each 12-month period thereafter shall not exceed 25 % of the level calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b);
