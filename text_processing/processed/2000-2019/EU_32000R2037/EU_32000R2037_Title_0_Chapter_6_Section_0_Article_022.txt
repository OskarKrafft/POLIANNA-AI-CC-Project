Article 22
New substances
1. The production, release for free circulation in the Community and inward processing, placing on the market and use of new substances in Annex II are prohibited. This prohibition does not apply to new substances if they are used as feedstock.
2. The Commission shall, as appropriate, make proposals to include in Annex II any substances that are not controlled substances but that are found by the Scientific Assessment Panel under the Protocol to have a significant ozone-depleting potential, including on possible exemptions from paragraph 1.
