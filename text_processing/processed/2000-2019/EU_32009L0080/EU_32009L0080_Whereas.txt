Whereas:
(1)
Council Directive 93/29/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (3) has been substantially amended (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.
(2)
Directive 93/29/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles as replaced by Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (5) and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of two or three-wheel motor vehicles as regards the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators. These technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to allow for the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle. Consequently the provisions laid down in Directive 2002/24/EC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.
(3)
In order to facilitate access to the markets of non-Community countries an equivalence should exist between the requirements of this Directive and those of Regulation No 60 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (6) (UNECE).
(4)
This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
