Article 9
Excess emissions premium
1.   In respect of each calendar year from 2012 onwards for which a manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 exceed its specific emissions target in that year, the Commission shall impose an excess emissions premium on the manufacturer or, in the case of a pool, the pool manager.
2.   The excess emissions premium under paragraph 1 shall be calculated using the following formulae:
(a)
From 2012 until 2018:
(i)
Where the manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 exceed its specific emissions target by more than 3 g CO2/km:
((Excess emissions – 3 g CO2/km) × 95 €/g CO2/km + 1 g CO2/km × 25 €/g CO2/km + 1 g CO2/km × 15 €/g CO2/km + 1 g CO2/km × 5 €/g CO2/km) × number of new passenger cars.
(ii)
Where the manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 exceed its specific emissions target by more than 2 g CO2/km but no more than 3 g CO2/km:
((Excess emissions – 2 g CO2/km) × 25 €/g CO2/km + 1 g CO2/km × 15 €/g CO2/km + 1 g CO2/km × 5 €/g CO2/km) × number of new passenger cars.
(iii)
Where the manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 exceed its specific emissions target by more than 1 but no more than 2 g CO2/km:
((Excess emissions – 1 g CO2/km) × 15 €/g CO2/km + 1 g CO2/km × 5 €/g CO2/km) × number of new passenger cars.
(iv)
Where the manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 exceed its specific emissions target by no more than 1 g CO2/km:
(Excess emissions × 5 €/g CO2/km) × number of new passenger cars.
(b)
From 2019:
(Excess emissions × 95 €/g CO2/km) × number of new passenger cars.
For the purposes of this Article, ‘excess emissions’, determined as set out in Article 4, means the positive number of grams per kilometre by which the manufacturer's average specific emissions — taking into account CO2 emissions reductions due to approved innovative technologies — exceeded its specific emissions target in the calendar year rounded to the nearest three decimal places; and ‘number of new passenger cars’ means the number of new passenger cars of which it is the manufacturer and which were registered in that year according to the phase-in criteria set out in Article 4.
3.   The Commission shall establish methods for the collection of excess emissions premiums under paragraph 1.
Those measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 14(3).
4.   The amounts of the excess emissions premium shall be considered as revenue for the general budget of the European Union.
