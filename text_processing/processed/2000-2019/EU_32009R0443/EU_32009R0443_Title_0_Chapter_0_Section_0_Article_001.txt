Subject matter and objectives
This Regulation establishes CO2 emissions performance requirements for new passenger cars in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and to achieve the overall objective of the European Community of 120 g CO2/km as average emissions for the new car fleet. This Regulation sets the average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars at 130 g CO2/km, by means of improvement in vehicle motor technology, as measured in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and its implementing measures and innovative technologies.
From 2020 onwards, this Regulation sets a target of 95 g CO2/km as average emissions for the new car fleet, in accordance with Article 13(5).
This Regulation will be complemented by additional measures corresponding to a reduction of 10 g CO2/km as part of the Community's integrated approach.
