Article 6
Specific emissions target for alternative-fuel vehicles
For the purpose of determining compliance by a manufacturer with its specific emissions target referred to in Article 4, the specific emissions of CO2 of each vehicle designed to be capable of running on a mixture of petrol with 85 % ethanol (‘E85’) which meets relevant Community legislation or European technical standards, shall be reduced by 5 % until 31 December 2015 in recognition of the greater technological and emissions reduction capability when running on biofuels. This reduction shall apply only where at least 30 % of the filling stations in the Member State in which the vehicle is registered provide this type of alternative fuel complying with the sustainability criteria for biofuels set out in relevant Community legislation.
