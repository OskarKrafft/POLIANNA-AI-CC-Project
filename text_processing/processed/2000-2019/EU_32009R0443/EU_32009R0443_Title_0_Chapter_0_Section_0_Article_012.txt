Article 12
Eco-innovation
1.   Upon application by a supplier or a manufacturer, CO2 savings achieved through the use of innovative technologies shall be considered. The total contribution of those technologies to reducing the specific emissions target of a manufacturer may be up to 7 g CO2/km.
2.   The Commission shall, by 2010, adopt detailed provisions for a procedure to approve such innovative technologies in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 14(2). Those detailed provisions shall be based on the following criteria for innovative technologies:
(a)
the supplier or manufacturer must be accountable for the CO2 savings achieved through the use of the innovative technologies;
(b)
the innovative technologies must make a verified contribution to CO2 reduction;
(c)
the innovative technologies must not be covered by the standard test cycle CO2 measurement or by mandatory provisions due to complementary additional measures complying with the 10 g CO2/km reduction referred to in Article 1 or be mandatory under other provisions of Community law.
3.   A supplier or a manufacturer who applies for a measure to be approved as an innovative technology shall submit a report, including a verification report undertaken by an independent and certified body, to the Commission. In the event of a possible interaction of the measure with another innovative technology already approved, the report shall mention that interaction and the verification report shall evaluate to what extent that interaction modifies the reduction achieved by each measure.
4.   The Commission shall attest the reduction achieved on the basis of the criteria set out in paragraph 2.
