Article 10
Exemption for aircraft operations of an exceptional nature
The competent authorities may, on a case-by-case basis, authorise individual operations at airports for which they are responsible in respect of marginally compliant aircraft which could not otherwise take place on the basis of this Regulation.
The exemption shall be limited to:
(a)
operations which are of such an exceptional nature that it would be unreasonable to withhold a temporary exemption, including humanitarian aid flights; or
(b)
non-revenue flights for the purpose of alterations, repair or maintenance.
