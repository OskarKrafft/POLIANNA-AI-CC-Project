(b)
paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:
‘9.   For proceedings initiated pursuant to Article 10(11), an investigation shall, whenever possible, be concluded within one year. In any event, such investigations shall in all cases be concluded within 13 months of their initiation, in accordance with the findings made pursuant to Article 13 for undertakings or the findings made pursuant to Article 15 for definitive action.

(4)
Article 12 is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   Provisional duties may be imposed if:
(a)
proceedings have been initiated in accordance with Article 10;
(b)
a notice has been given to that effect and interested parties have been given an adequate opportunity to submit information and make comments in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(12);
(c)
a provisional affirmative determination has been made that the imported product benefits from countervailable subsidies and consequent injury to the Union industry; and
(d)
the Union interest calls for intervention to prevent such injury.
The provisional duties shall be imposed no earlier than 60 days from the initiation of the proceedings but no later than nine months from the initiation of the proceedings.
The amount of the provisional countervailing duty shall correspond to the total amount of countervailable subsidies as provisionally established.
Where the Commission, on the basis of all the information submitted, can clearly conclude provisionally that it is not in the Union’s interest to impose the provisional duty at that amount, the provisional countervailing duty shall be the amount adequate to remove the injury to the Union industry, if this is lower than the total amount of countervailable subsidies.
Provisional duties shall not be imposed within a period of three weeks after the information is sent to interested parties under Article 29a (period of pre-disclosure). The provision of such information shall not prejudice any subsequent related decision that may be taken by the Commission.
The Commission shall review by 9 June 2020, whether a substantial rise in imports has occurred during the period of pre-disclosure and whether, if such rise has occurred, it has caused additional injury to the Union industry, despite the measures that the Commission might have taken based on Article 24(5a) and Article 15(1). It shall rely in particular on data collected on the basis of Article 24(6) and any relevant information at its disposal. The Commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 32b to amend the duration of the period of pre-disclosure to two weeks in the case of a substantial rise of imports that have caused additional injury and to four weeks where this is not the case.
The Commission shall make public on its website its intention to impose provisional duties, including information on the possible duty rates, at the same time when it provides interested parties with the information pursuant to Article 29a.’;
(b)
the following paragraphs are inserted:
‘1a.   When the injury margin is calculated on the basis of a target price, the target profit used shall be established taking into account factors such as the level of profitability before the increase of imports from the country under investigation, the level of profitability needed to cover full costs and investments, research and development (R&D) and innovation, and the level of profitability to be expected under normal conditions of competition. Such profit margin shall not be lower than 6 %.
1b.   When establishing the target price, the actual cost of production of the Union industry, which results from multilateral environmental agreements, and protocols thereunder, to which the Union is a party, or from International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions listed in Annex Ia to this Regulation, shall be duly reflected. Moreover, future costs, which are not covered in paragraph 1a of this Article, which result from those agreements and conventions, and which the Union industry will incur during the period of the application of the measure pursuant to Article 18(1), shall be taken into account.’.
(5)
Article 13 is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   Where a provisional affirmative determination of subsidisation and injury has been made, the Commission may, in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 25(2), accept satisfactory voluntary undertakings offers under which:
(a)
the country of origin and/or export agrees to eliminate or limit the subsidy or take other measures concerning its effects; or
(b)
any exporter undertakes to revise its prices or to cease exports to the area in question as long as such exports benefit from countervailable subsidies, if the injurious effect of the subsidies is thereby eliminated.
In such a case and as long as such undertakings are in force, provisional duties imposed by the Commission in accordance with Article 12(3), or definitive duties imposed in accordance with Article 15(1), as the case may be, shall not apply to the relevant imports of the product concerned manufactured by the companies referred to in the Commission decision accepting undertakings, as subsequently amended.
Price increases under such undertakings shall not be higher than necessary to offset the amount of countervailable subsidies.
Where the Commission, on the basis of all the information submitted, can clearly conclude provisionally that it is not in the Union’s interest to determine the price increase under such undertakings, in accordance with the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, the increase under such undertakings shall be less than the amount of countervailable subsidies if such increase would be adequate to remove the injury to the Union industry.’;
(b)
in paragraph 2, the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘Save in exceptional circumstances, undertakings may not be offered later than five days prior to the end of the period during which representations may be made pursuant to Article 30(5), so as to ensure the opportunity to comment for other parties.’;
(c)
paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:
‘3.   Undertakings offered need not be accepted if their acceptance is considered impractical, such as where the number of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for other reasons, including reasons of general policy which comprise in particular the principles and obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements and protocols thereunder, to which the Union is a party, and of ILO Conventions listed in Annex Ia to this Regulation. The exporter and/or the country of origin and/or export concerned may be provided with the reasons for which it is proposed to reject the offer of an undertaking and may be given an opportunity to make comments thereon. The reasons for rejection shall be set out in the definitive decision.
4.   Parties which offer an undertaking shall be required to provide a non-confidential version of such undertaking that is meaningful in the sense of Article 29, so that it may be made available to interested parties to the investigation, to the European Parliament and to the Council.
Furthermore, before accepting any such offer, the Union industry shall be given an opportunity to comment with regard to the main features of the undertaking.’.
(6)
in Article 14, paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:
‘5.   The amount of the countervailable subsidies shall be considered to be de minimis if such amount is less than 1 % ad valorem. However, as regards investigations concerning imports from developing countries, the de minimis threshold shall be 2 % ad valorem.’.
(7)
in Article 15(1), the third subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘The amount of the countervailing duty shall not exceed the amount of countervailable subsidies established.
Where the Commission, on the basis of all the information submitted, can clearly conclude that it is not in the Union’s interest to determine the amount of measures in accordance with the third subparagraph, the amount of the countervailing duty shall be less if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the Union industry.
Where the Commission has not registered imports, but where the Commission finds, based on an analysis of all relevant information at its disposal when adopting definitive measures, that a further substantial rise in imports subject to the investigation occurs during the period of pre-disclosure, the Commission shall reflect the additional injury resulting from such increase in the determination of the injury margin for a period no longer than that referred to in Article 18(1).’.
(8)
in Article 18(1), the following subparagraph is added:
‘If, following an investigation pursuant to this Article, the measure expires, any duties collected from the date of the initiation of such investigation on goods that were customs-cleared shall be repaid provided that this is requested from national customs authorities and granted by those authorities in accordance with the applicable Union customs legislation concerning repayment and remission of duty. Such repayment shall not give rise to the payment of interest by the national customs authorities concerned.’.
(9)
Article 23 is amended as follows:
(a)
in paragraph 4, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘4.   Investigations shall be initiated pursuant to this Article on the initiative of the Commission or at the request of a Member State or any interested party on the basis of sufficient evidence regarding the factors set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article. Initiations shall be made by means of a Commission regulation which shall also instruct customs authorities to subject imports to registration in accordance with Article 24(5) or to request guarantees. The Commission shall provide information to the Member States once an interested party or a Member State has submitted a request justifying the initiation of an investigation and the Commission has completed its analysis thereof, or where the Commission has itself determined that there is a need to initiate an investigation.’;
(b)
in paragraph 6, the second and third subparagraphs are replaced by the following:
‘Where the circumventing practice, process or work takes place outside the Union, exemptions may be granted to producers of the product concerned that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in paragraph 3.
Where the circumventing practice, process or work takes place inside the Union, exemptions may be granted to importers that can show that they are not engaged in circumvention practices as defined in paragraph 3.’.

(a)
paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
‘3.   Special provisions, in particular with regard to the common definition of the concept of origin, as contained in Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*3), and with regard to the application and collection of a countervailing duty in the continental shelf of a Member State or the exclusive economic zone declared by a Member State pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), may be adopted pursuant to this Regulation.

(*3)  Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).’;"
                        
(b)
paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:
‘5.   As of the initiation of the investigation and having informed Member States in due time, the Commission may direct the customs authorities to take the appropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. Imports shall be made subject to registration following a request, from the Union industry, which contains sufficient evidence to justify such action. Imports may also be made subject to registration on the Commission’s own initiative. Registration shall be introduced by Commission regulation. Such regulation shall specify the purpose of the action and, if appropriate, the estimated amount of possible future liability. Imports shall not be made subject to registration for a period longer than nine months.’;
(c)
the following paragraph is inserted:
‘5a.   The Commission shall, unless it has sufficient evidence within the meaning of Article 10 that the requirements either under point (c) or (d) of Article 16(4) are not met, register imports pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article during the period of pre-disclosure pursuant to Article 29a. When deciding on registration, the Commission shall in particular analyse the information collected based on the creation of Integrated Tariff of the European Union (TARIC) codes for the product under investigation pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Article.’;
(d)
paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:
‘6.   Member States shall report to the Commission every month on the import trade in products subject to investigation and to measures, and on the amount of duties collected pursuant to this Regulation. When initiating an investigation pursuant to Article 10, the Commission shall create TARIC codes corresponding to the product under investigation. Member States shall use those TARIC codes in order to report on imports of the product under investigation as of the initiation of the investigation. The Commission may, upon receiving a specific reasoned request from an interested party, decide to provide them with a non-confidential summary of the information on aggregated import volumes and values of the products concerned.’;
(e)
the following paragraph is added:
‘8.   Whenever the Commission intends to adopt any document providing general guidance to possible interested parties on the application of this Regulation, a public consultation in line with Article 11(3) TEU shall be carried out. The European Parliament and the Council may also express their views.’.
(11)
the following Article is inserted:
‘Article 24a
Continental shelf of a Member State or exclusive economic zone
1.   A countervailing duty may also be imposed on any subsidised product brought in significant quantities to an artificial island, a fixed or floating installation or any other structure in the continental shelf of a Member State or the exclusive economic zone declared by a Member State pursuant to UNCLOS, where this would cause injury to the Union industry. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the conditions for the incurrence of such duties, as well as the procedures relating to the notification and declaration of such products and the payment of such duties, including recovery, repayment and remission (customs tool). Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 25(3).
2.   The Commission shall only impose duties as referred to in paragraph 1 as of the date the customs tool referred to in paragraph 1 is operational.

2.   The final selection of parties, types of products or transactions made under those sampling provisions shall rest with the Commission. However, in order to enable the selection of a representative sample preference shall be given to choosing a sample in consultation with, and with the consent of, the parties concerned, provided that such parties make themselves known and make sufficient information available, within one week of initiation of the investigation.’.

Information at provisional stage
1.   Union producers, importers and exporters and their representative associations, and the country of origin and/or export, may request information on the planned imposition of provisional duties.

Such information shall be provided to those parties three weeks before the imposition of provisional duties. Such information shall include: a summary of the proposed duties for information purposes only, and details of the calculation of the amount of the countervailable subsidy and the margin adequate to remove the injury to the Union industry, due account being taken of the need to respect the confidentiality obligations contained in Article 29. Parties shall have a period of three working days from the supply of such information to provide comments on the accuracy of the calculations.
2.   In cases where it is intended not to impose provisional duties but to continue the investigation, interested parties shall be informed of the non-imposition of duties three weeks before the expiry of the deadline mentioned in Article 12(1) for the imposition of provisional duties.’.
