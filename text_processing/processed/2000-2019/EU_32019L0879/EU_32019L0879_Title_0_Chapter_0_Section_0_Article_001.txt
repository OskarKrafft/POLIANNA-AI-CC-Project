Where an entity is in the situation referred to in the first subparagraph, it shall immediately notify the resolution authority thereof.
2.   In the situation referred to in paragraph 1, the resolution authority of the entity, after consulting the competent authority, shall without unnecessary delay assess whether to exercise the power referred to in paragraph 1, taking into account all of the following elements:
(a)
the reason, duration and magnitude of the failure and its impact on resolvability;
(b)
the development of the entity's financial situation and the likelihood of it fulfilling, in the foreseeable future, the condition referred to in point (a) of Article 32(1);

(e)
whether the exercise of the power referred to in paragraph 1 is the most adequate and proportionate means of addressing the situation of the entity, taking into account its potential impact on both the financing conditions and resolvability of the entity concerned.
The resolution authority shall repeat its assessment of whether to exercise the power referred to in paragraph 1 at least every month for as long as the entity continues to be in the situation referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   If the resolution authority finds that the entity is still in the situation referred to in paragraph 1 nine months after such situation has been notified by the entity, the resolution authority, after consulting the competent authority, shall exercise the power referred to in paragraph 1, except where the resolution authority finds, following an assessment, that at least two of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the failure is due to a serious disturbance to the functioning of financial markets which leads to broad-based financial market stress across several segments of financial markets;
(b)
the disturbance referred to in point (a) not only results in the increased price volatility of the own funds instruments and eligible liabilities instruments of the entity or increased costs for the entity, but also leads to a full or partial closure of markets which prevents the entity from issuing own funds instruments and eligible liabilities instruments on those markets;
(c)
the market closure referred to in point (b) is observed not only for the concerned entity, but also for several other entities;
(d)
the disturbance referred to in point (a) prevents the concerned entity from issuing own funds instruments and eligible liabilities instruments sufficient to remedy the failure; or
(e)
an exercise of the power referred to in paragraph 1 leads to negative spill-over effects for part of the banking sector, thereby potentially undermining financial stability.
Where the exception referred to in the first subparagraph applies, the resolution authority shall notify the competent authority of its decision and shall explain its assessment in writing.
Every month, the resolution authority shall repeat its assessment of whether the exception referred to in the first subparagraph applies.

Power to suspend certain obligations
1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities, after consulting the competent authorities, which shall reply in a timely manner, have the power to suspend any payment or delivery obligations pursuant to any contract to which an institution or an entity referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) is a party, where all of the following conditions are met:

At the expiry of the period of suspension referred to in the first subparagraph, the suspension shall cease to have effect.
5.   When exercising the power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, resolution authorities shall have regard to the impact the exercise of that power might have on the orderly functioning of financial markets and shall consider the existing national rules, as well as supervisory and judicial powers, to safeguard creditors' rights and equal treatment of creditors in normal insolvency proceedings. Resolution authorities shall in particular have regard to the potential application of national insolvency proceedings to the institution or entity as a result of the determination in point (c) of Article 32(1) and shall make the arrangements they deem appropriate to ensure adequate coordination with the national administrative or judicial authorities.
6.   When payment or delivery obligations under a contract are suspended pursuant to paragraph 1, the payment or delivery obligations of any counterparties to that contract shall be suspended for the same period of time.
7.   A payment or delivery obligation that would have been due during the period of the suspension shall be due immediately upon expiry of that period.
8.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities notify the institution or the entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) and the authorities referred to in points (a) to (h) of Article 83(2) without delay when exercising the power referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article after a determination has been made that the institution is failing or likely to fail pursuant to point (a) of Article 32(1) and before the resolution decision is taken.
The resolution authority shall publish or ensure the publication of the order or instrument by which obligations are suspended under this Article and the terms and period of suspension, by the means referred to in Article 83(4).

Such powers shall be exercised in accordance with the scope, duration and conditions provided for in the relevant national laws. The conditions provided for in this Article shall be without prejudice to the conditions related to such power of suspension payment or delivery obligations.
10.   Member States shall ensure that when a resolution authority exercises the power to suspend payment or delivery obligations with respect to an institution or an entity referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the resolution authority is also able, for the duration of that suspension, to exercise the power to:
(a)
restrict secured creditors of that institution or entity from enforcing security interests in relation to any of the assets of that institution or entity for the same duration, in which case Article 70(2), (3) and (4) shall apply; and
(b)
suspend the termination rights of any party to a contract with that institution or entity for the same duration, in which case Article 71(2) to (8) shall apply.

Article 72a;
(b)
Article 72b, with the exception of point (d) of paragraph 2; and
(c)
Article 72c.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, where this Directive refers to the requirements in Article 92a or Article 92b of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for the purpose of those Articles, eligible liabilities shall consist of eligible liabilities as defined in Article 72k of that Regulation and determined in accordance with Chapter 5a of Title I of Part Two of that Regulation.
2.   Liabilities that arise from debt instruments with embedded derivatives, such as structured notes, that meet the conditions of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, except for point (l) of Article 72a(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, shall be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities only where one of the following conditions is met:
(a)
the principal amount of the liability arising from the debt instrument is known at the time of issue, is fixed or increasing, and is not affected by an embedded derivative feature, and the total amount of the liability arising from the debt instrument, including the embedded derivative, can be valued on a daily basis by reference to an active and liquid two-way market for an equivalent instrument without credit risk, in accordance with Articles 104 and 105 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; or
(b)
the debt instrument includes a contractual term that specifies that the value of the claim in cases of the insolvency of the issuer and of the resolution of the issuer is fixed or increasing, and does not exceed the initially paid-up amount of the liability.
Debt instruments referred to in the first subparagraph, including their embedded derivatives, shall not be subject to any netting agreement and the valuation of such instruments shall not be subject to Article 49(3).
The liabilities referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities with respect to the part of the liability that corresponds to the principal amount referred to in point (a) of that subparagraph or to the fixed or increasing amount referred to in point (b) of that subparagraph.
3.   Where liabilities are issued by a subsidiary established in the Union to an existing shareholder that is not part of the same resolution group, and that subsidiary is part of the same resolution group as the resolution entity, those liabilities shall be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities of that resolution entity, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
they are issued in accordance with point (a) of Article 45f(2);
(b)
the exercise of the write down or conversion power in relation to those liabilities in accordance with Articles 59 or 62 does not affect the control of the subsidiary by the resolution entity;
(c)
those liabilities do not exceed an amount determined by subtracting:
(i)
the sum of the liabilities issued to and bought by the resolution entity either directly or indirectly through other entities in the same resolution group and the amount of own funds issued in accordance with point (b) of Article 45f(2) from
(ii)
the amount required in accordance with Article 45f(1).
4.   Without prejudice to the minimum requirement in Article 45c(5) or point (a) of Article 45d(1), resolution authorities shall ensure that a part of the requirement referred to in Article 45e equal to 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, shall be met by resolution entities that are G-SIIs or resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article. The resolution authority may permit that a level lower than 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, but greater than the amount resulting from the application of the formula (1-(X1/X2)) × 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, shall be met by resolution entities that are G-SIIs or resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred in paragraph 3 of this Article, provided that all the conditions set out in Article 72b(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 are met, where, in light of the reduction that is possible under Article 72b(3) of that Regulation:
 
X1 = 3,5 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; and
 
X2 = the sum of 18 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the amount of the combined buffer requirement.
For resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5), where the application of the first subparagraph of this paragraph leads to a requirement greater than 27 % of the total risk exposure amount, for the resolution entity concerned, the resolution authority shall limit the part of the requirement referred to in Article 45e which is to be met using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, to an amount equal to 27 % of the total risk exposure amount, if the resolution authority has assessed that:
(a)
access to the resolution financing arrangement is not considered to be an option for resolving that resolution entity in the resolution plan; and
(b)
where point (a) does not apply, the requirement referred to in Article 45e allows that resolution entity to meet the requirements referred to in Article 44(5) or 44(8) as applicable.
In carrying out the assessment referred to in the second subparagraph, the resolution authority shall also take into account the risk of disproportionate impact on the business model of the resolution entity concerned.
For resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(6), the second subparagraph of this paragraph does not apply.
5.   For resolution entities that are neither G-SIIs nor resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6), the resolution authority may decide that a part of the requirement referred to in Article 45e up to the greater of 8 % of the total liabilities, including own funds, of the entity and the formula referred to in paragraph 7, shall be met using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, provided that the following conditions are met:
(a)
non-subordinated liabilities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article have the same priority ranking in the national insolvency hierarchy as certain liabilities that are excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or Article 44(3);
(b)
there is a risk that, as a result of a planned application of write-down and conversion powers to non-subordinated liabilities that are not excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or Article 44(3), creditors whose claims arise from those liabilities incur greater losses than they would incur in a winding up under normal insolvency proceedings;
(c)
the amount of own funds and other subordinated liabilities does not exceed the amount necessary to ensure that the creditors referred to in point (b) do not incur losses above the level of losses that they would otherwise have incurred in the winding-up under normal insolvency proceedings.
Where the resolution authority determines that, within a class of liabilities which includes eligible liabilities, the amount of the liabilities that are excluded or reasonably likely to be excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or Article 44(3) totals more than 10 % of that class, the resolution authority shall assess the risk referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
6.   For the purposes of paragraphs 4, 5 and 7, derivative liabilities shall be included in total liabilities on the basis that full recognition is given to counterparty netting rights.
The own funds of a resolution entity that are used to comply with the combined buffer requirement shall be eligible to comply with the requirements referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7.
7.   By derogation from paragraph 4 of this Article, the resolution authority may decide that the requirement referred to in Article 45e of this Directive shall be met by resolution entities that are G-SIIs or resolution entities that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) of this Directive using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, to the extent that, due to the obligation of the resolution entity to comply with the combined buffer requirement and the requirements referred to in Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Article 45c(5) and Article 45 e of this Directive, the sum of those own funds, instruments and liabilities does not exceed the greater of:
(a)
8 % of total liabilities, including own funds, of the entity; or
(b)
the amount resulting from the application of the formula Ax2+Bx2+C, where A, B and C are the following amounts:
 
A = the amount resulting from the requirement referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
 
B = the amount resulting from the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU;
 
C = the amount resulting from the combined buffer requirement.
8.   Resolution authorities may exercise the power referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article with respect to resolution entities that are G-SIIs or that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6), and that meet one of the conditions set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph, up to a limit of 30 % of the total number of all resolution entities that are G-SIIs or that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) for which the resolution authority determines the requirement referred to in Article 45e.
The conditions shall be considered by resolution authorities as follows:
(a)
substantive impediments to resolvability have been identified in the preceding resolvability assessment and either:
(i)
no remedial action has been taken following the application of the measures referred to in Article 17(5) in the timeline required by the resolution authority, or
(ii)
the identified substantive impediments cannot be addressed using any of the measures referred to in Article 17(5), and the exercise of the power referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article would partially or fully compensate for the negative impact of the substantive impediments on resolvability;
(b)
the resolution authority considers that the feasibility and credibility of the resolution entity's preferred resolution strategy is limited, taking into account the entity's size, its interconnectedness, the nature, scope, risk and complexity of its activities, its legal status and its shareholding structure; or
(c)
the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU reflects the fact that the resolution entity that is a G-SII or that is subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) of this Directive is, in terms of riskiness, among the top 20 % of institutions for which the resolution authority determines the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) of this Directive.
For the purposes of the percentages referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, the resolution authority shall round the number resulting from the calculation up to the closest whole number.
Member States may, by taking into account the specificities of their national banking sector, including in particular the number of resolution entities that are G-SIIs or that are subject to Article 45c(5) or (6) for which the national resolution authority determines the requirement referred to in Article 45e, set the percentage referred to in the first subparagraph at a level higher than 30 %.
9.   The resolution authority shall only take the decisions referred to in paragraph 5 or 7 after consulting the competent authority.
When taking those decisions, the resolution authority shall also take into account:
(a)
the depth of the market for the resolution entity's own funds instruments and subordinated eligible instruments, the pricing of such instruments, where they exist, and the time needed to execute any transactions necessary for the purpose of complying with the decision;
(b)
the amount of eligible liabilities instruments that meet all of the conditions referred to in Article 72a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 that have a residual maturity below one year as of the date of the decision, with a view to making quantitative adjustments to the requirements referred to in paragraphs 5 and 7 of this Article;
(c)
the availability and the amount of instruments that meet all of the conditions referred to in Article 72a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 other than point (d) of Article 72b(2) of that Regulation;
(d)
whether the amount of liabilities that are excluded from the application of write down and conversion powers in accordance with Article 44(2) or (3) and that, in normal insolvency proceedings, rank equally with or below the highest ranking eligible liabilities is significant in comparison to the own funds and eligible liabilities of the resolution entity. Where the amount of excluded liabilities does not exceed 5 % of the amount of the own funds and eligible liabilities of the resolution entity, the excluded amount shall be considered as not being significant. Above that threshold, the significance of the excluded liabilities shall be assessed by resolution authorities;
(e)
the resolution entity's business model, funding model, and risk profile, as well as its stability and ability to contribute to the economy; and
(f)
the impact of possible restructuring costs on the resolution entity's recapitalisation.
Article 45c
Determination of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities
1.   The requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be determined by the resolution authority, after consulting the competent authority, on the basis of the following criteria:
(a)
the need to ensure that the resolution group can be resolved by the application of the resolution tools to the resolution entity, including, where appropriate, the bail-in tool, in a way that meets the resolution objectives;
(b)
the need to ensure, where appropriate, that the resolution entity and its subsidiaries that are institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) but are not resolution entities have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities to ensure that, if the bail-in tool or write down and conversion powers, respectively, were to be applied to them, losses could be absorbed and that it is possible to restore the total capital ratio and, as applicable, the leverage ratio, of the relevant entities to a level necessary to enable them to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to carry on the activities for which they are authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU;
(c)
the need to ensure, if the resolution plan anticipates the possibility for certain classes of eligible liabilities to be excluded from bail-in pursuant to Article 44(3) of this Directive or to be transferred in full to a recipient under a partial transfer, that the resolution entity has sufficient own funds and other eligible liabilities to absorb losses and to restore its total capital ratio and, as applicable, its leverage ratio, to the level necessary to enable it to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to carry on the activities for which it is authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2014/65/EU;
(d)
the size, the business model, the funding model and the risk profile of the entity;
(e)
the extent to which the failure of the entity would have an adverse effect on financial stability, including through contagion to other institutions or entities, due to the interconnectedness of the entity with those other institutions or entities or with the rest of the financial system.
2.   Where the resolution plan provides that resolution action is to be taken or that the power to write down and convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 is to be exercised in accordance with the relevant scenario referred to in Article 10(3), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall equal an amount sufficient to ensure that:
(a)
the losses that are expected to be incurred by the entity are fully absorbed (“loss absorption”);
(b)
the resolution entity and its subsidiaries that are institutions or entities referred to points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) but are not resolution entities are recapitalised to a level necessary to enable them to continue to comply with the conditions for authorisation, and to carry on the activities for which they are authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU, Directive 2014/65/EU or an equivalent legislative act for an appropriate period not longer than one year (“recapitalisation”).
Where the resolution plan provides that the entity is to be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings or other equivalent national procedures, the resolution authority shall assess whether it is justified to limit the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) for that entity, so that it does not exceed an amount sufficient to absorb losses in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph.
The assessment by the resolution authority shall, in particular, evaluate the limit referred to in the second subparagraph as regards any possible impact on financial stability and on the risk of contagion to the financial system.
3.   For resolution entities, the amount referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall be the following:
(a)
for the purpose of calculating the requirement referred to in Article 45(1), in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2), the sum of:
(i)
the amount of the losses to be absorbed in resolution that corresponds to the requirements referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU of the resolution entity at the consolidated resolution group level; and
(ii)
a recapitalisation amount that allows the resolution group resulting from resolution to restore compliance with its total capital ratio requirement referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and its requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU at the consolidated resolution group level after the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy; and
(b)
for the purpose of calculating the requirement referred to in Article 45(1), in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2), the sum of:
(i)
the amount of the losses to be absorbed in resolution that corresponds to the resolution entity's leverage ratio requirement referred to in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 at the consolidated resolution group level; and
(ii)
a recapitalisation amount that allows the resolution group resulting from resolution to restore compliance with the leverage ratio requirement referred to in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 at the consolidated resolution group level after the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy.
For the purposes of point (a) of Article 45(2), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be expressed in percentage terms as the amount calculated in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, divided by the total risk exposure amount.
For the purposes of point (b) of Article 45(2), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be expressed in percentage terms as the amount calculated in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, divided by the total exposure measure.
When setting the individual requirement provided in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the resolution authority shall take into account the requirements referred to in Articles 37(10), 44(5) and 44(8).
When setting the recapitalisation amounts referred to in the previous subparagraphs, the resolution authority shall:
(a)
use the most recently reported values for the relevant total risk exposure amount or total exposure measure, adjusted for any changes resulting from resolution actions set out in the resolution plan; and
(b)
after consulting the competent authority, adjust the amount corresponding to the current requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU downwards or upwards to determine the requirement that is to apply to the resolution entity after the implementation of the preferred resolution strategy.
The resolution authority shall be able to increase the requirement provided in point (a)(ii) of the first subparagraph by an appropriate amount necessary to ensure that, following resolution, the entity is able to sustain sufficient market confidence for an appropriate period, which shall not exceed one year.
Where the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph applies, the amount referred to in that subparagraph shall be equal to the combined buffer requirement that is to apply after the application of the resolution tools, less the amount referred to in point (a) of point (6) of Article 128 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
The amount referred to in the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adjusted downwards if, after consulting the competent authority, the resolution authority determines that it would be feasible and credible for a lower amount to be sufficient to sustain market confidence and to ensure both the continued provision of critical economic functions by the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) and its access to funding without recourse to extraordinary public financial support other than contributions from resolution financing arrangements, in accordance with Article 44(5) and (8) and Article 101(2), after implementation of the resolution strategy. That amount shall be adjusted upwards if, after consulting the competent authority, the resolution authority determines that a higher amount is necessary to sustain sufficient market confidence and to ensure both the continued provision of critical economic functions by the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) and its access to funding without recourse to extraordinary public financial support other than contributions from resolution financing arrangements, in accordance with Article 44(5) and (8) and Article 101(2), for an appropriate period which shall not exceed one year.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the methodology to be used by resolution authorities to estimate the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU and the combined buffer requirement for resolution entities at the resolution group consolidated level where the resolution group is not subject to those requirements under that Directive.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
5.   For resolution entities that are not subject to Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and that are part of a resolution group the total assets of which exceed EUR 100 billion, the level of the requirement referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be at least equal to:
(a)
13,5 % when calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2); and
(b)
5 % when calculated in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2).
By way of derogation from Article 45b, the resolution entities referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall meet a level of the requirement referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph that is equal to 13,5 % when calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2) and to 5 % when calculated in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2) using own funds, subordinated eligible instruments, or liabilities as referred to in Article 45b(3) of this Directive.
6.   A resolution authority may, after consulting the competent authority, decide to apply the requirements laid down in paragraph 5 of this Article to a resolution entity which is not subject to Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which is part of a resolution group the total assets of which are lower than EUR 100 billion and which the resolution authority has assessed as reasonably likely to pose a systemic risk in the event of its failure.
When taking a decision as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, a resolution authority shall take into account:
(a)
the prevalence of deposits, and the absence of debt instruments, in the funding model;
(b)
the extent to which access to the capital markets for eligible liabilities is limited;
(c)
the extent to which the resolution entity relies on Common Equity Tier 1 capital to meet the requirement referred to in Article 45e.
The absence of a decision pursuant to the first subparagraph of this paragraph is without prejudice to any decision under Article 45b(5).
7.   For entities that are not themselves resolution entities, the amount referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall be the following:
(a)
for the purpose of calculating the requirement referred to in Article 45(1), in accordance with point (a) of Article 45(2), the sum of:
(i)
the amount of the losses to be absorbed that corresponds to the requirements referred to in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU of the entity; and
(ii)
a recapitalisation amount that allows the entity to restore compliance with its total capital ratio requirement referred in point (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and its requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU after the exercise of the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 of this Directive or after the resolution of the resolution group; and
(b)
for the purpose of calculating the requirement referred to in Article 45(1), in accordance with point (b) of Article 45(2), the sum of:
(i)
the amount of the losses to be absorbed that corresponds to the entity's leverage ratio requirement referred to in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; and
(ii)
a recapitalisation amount that allows the entity to restore compliance with its leverage ratio requirement referred to in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 after the exercise of the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 of this Directive or after the resolution of the resolution group.
For the purposes of point (a) of Article 45(2), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be expressed in percentage terms as the amount calculated in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, divided by the total risk exposure amount.
For the purposes of point (b) of Article 45(2), the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be expressed in percentage terms as the amount calculated in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, divided by the total exposure measure.
When setting the individual requirement provided in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the resolution authority shall take into account the requirements referred to in Articles 37(10), 44(5) and 44(8).
When setting the recapitalisation amounts referred to in the previous subparagraphs, the resolution authority shall:
(a)
use the most recently reported values for the relevant total risk exposure amount or total exposure measure, adjusted for any changes resulting from actions set out in the resolution plan; and
(b)
after consulting the competent authority, adjust the amount corresponding to the current requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU downwards or upwards to determine the requirement that is to apply to the relevant entity after the exercise of the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59 of this Directive or after the resolution of the resolution group.
The resolution authority shall be able to increase the requirement provided in point (a)(ii) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph by an appropriate amount necessary to ensure that, following the exercise of the power to write down or convert relevant capital instruments and eligible liabilities in accordance with Article 59, the entity is able to sustain sufficient market confidence for an appropriate period which shall not exceed one year.
Where the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph applies, the amount referred to in that subparagraph shall be equal to the combined buffer requirement that is to apply after the exercise of the power referred to in Article 59 of this Directive or after the resolution of the resolution group, less the amount referred to in point (a) of point (6) of Article 128 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
The amount referred to in the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adjusted downwards if, after consulting the competent authority, the resolution authority determines that it would be feasible and credible for a lower amount to be sufficient to ensure market confidence and to ensure both the continued provision of critical economic functions by the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) and its access to funding without recourse to extraordinary public financial support other than contributions from resolution financing arrangements, in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 8 of Article 44 and Article 101(2), after the exercise of the power referred to in Article 59 or after the resolution of the resolution group. That amount shall be adjusted upwards if, after consulting the competent authority, the resolution authority determines that a higher amount is necessary to sustain sufficient market confidence and to ensure both the continued provision of critical economic functions by the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) and its access to funding without recourse to extraordinary public financial support other than contributions from resolution financing arrangements, in accordance with Article 44(5) and (8) and Article 101(2) for an appropriate period which shall not exceed one year.
8.   Where the resolution authority expects that certain classes of eligible liabilities are reasonably likely to be fully or partially excluded from bail-in pursuant to Article 44(3) or might be transferred in full to a recipient under a partial transfer, the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) shall be met using own funds or other eligible liabilities that are sufficient to:
(a)
cover the amount of excluded liabilities identified in accordance with Article 44(3);
(b)
ensure that the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 are fulfilled.
9.   Any decision by the resolution authority to impose a minimum requirement of own funds and eligible liabilities under this Article shall contain the reasons for that decision, including a full assessment of the elements referred to in paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article, and shall be reviewed by the resolution authority without undue delay to reflect any changes in the level of the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU.
10.   For the purposes of paragraphs 3 and 7 of this Article, capital requirements shall be interpreted in accordance with the competent authority's application of the transitional provisions laid down in Chapters 1, 2 and 4 of Title I of Part Ten of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in the provisions of national legislation exercising the options granted to the competent authorities by that Regulation.
Article 45d
Determination of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities for resolution entities of G-SIIs and Union material subsidiaries of non-EU G-SIIs
1.   The requirement referred to in Article 45(1) for a resolution entity that is a G-SII or part of a G-SII shall consist of the following:

(b)
to an extent that ensures that the conditions set out in Article 45c are fulfilled.
4.   For the purposes of Article 45h(2), where more than one G-SII entity belonging to the same G-SII are resolution entities, the relevant resolution authorities shall calculate the amount referred to in paragraph 3:
(a)
for each resolution entity;
(b)
for the Union parent entity as if it was the only resolution entity of the G-SII.
5.   Any decision by the resolution authority to impose an additional requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities under point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article or point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain the reasons for that decision, including a full assessment of the elements referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, and shall be reviewed by the resolution authority without undue delay to reflect any changes in the level of the requirement referred to in Article 104a of Directive 2013/36/EU that applies to the resolution group or the Union material subsidiary of a non-EU G-SII.

3.   For resolution groups identified in accordance with point (b) of point (83b) of Article 2(1), the relevant resolution authority shall decide, depending on the features of the solidarity mechanism and of the preferred resolution strategy, which entities in the resolution group are to be required to comply with Article 45c(3) and (5) and Article 45d(1), in order to ensure that the resolution group as a whole complies with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and how such entities are to do so in conformity with the resolution plan.
Article 45f
Application of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities to entities that are not themselves resolution entities
1.   Institutions that are subsidiaries of a resolution entity or of a third-country entity, but are not themselves resolution entities, shall comply with the requirements laid down in Article 45c on an individual basis.
A resolution authority, after consulting the competent authority, may decide to apply the requirement laid down in this Article to an entity referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) that is a subsidiary of a resolution entity but is not itself a resolution entity.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, Union parent undertakings that are not themselves resolution entities, but are subsidiaries of third-country entities, shall comply with the requirements laid down in Articles 45c and 45d on a consolidated basis.

2.   The requirement referred to in Article 45(1) for entities referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be met using one or more of the following:
(a)
liabilities:
(i)
that are issued to and bought by the resolution entity, either directly or indirectly through other entities in the same resolution group that bought the liabilities from the entity that is subject to this Article, or are issued to and bought by an existing shareholder that is not part of the same resolution group as long as the exercise of write down or conversion powers in accordance with Articles 59 to 62 does not affect the control of the subsidiary by the resolution entity;

are issued to and bought by entities that are included in the same resolution group, or
—
are issued to and bought by entities that are not included in the same resolution group as long as the exercise of write down or conversion powers in accordance with Articles 59 to 62 does not affect the control of the subsidiary by the resolution entity.
3.   The resolution authority of a subsidiary that is not a resolution entity may waive the application of this Article to that subsidiary where:
(a)
both the subsidiary and the resolution entity are established in the same Member State and are part of the same resolution group;
(b)
the resolution entity complies with the requirement referred to in Article 45e;
(c)
there is no current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities by the resolution entity to the subsidiary in respect of which a determination has been made in accordance with Article 59(3), in particular where resolution action is taken in respect of the resolution entity;
(d)
the resolution entity satisfies the competent authority regarding the prudent management of the subsidiary and has declared, with the consent of the competent authority, that it guarantees the commitments entered into by the subsidiary, or the risks in the subsidiary are of no significance;
(e)
the risk evaluation, measurement and control procedures of the resolution entity cover the subsidiary;
(f)
the resolution entity holds more than 50 % of the voting rights attached to shares in the capital of the subsidiary or has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the management body of the subsidiary.
4.   The resolution authority of a subsidiary that is not a resolution entity may also waive the application of this Article to that subsidiary where:
(a)
both the subsidiary and its parent undertaking are established in the same Member State and are part of the same resolution group;
(b)
the parent undertaking complies on a consolidated basis with the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) in that Member State;
(c)
there is no current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities by the parent undertaking to the subsidiary in respect of which a determination has been made in accordance with Article 59(3), in particular where resolution action or powers referred to in Article 59(1) are taken in respect of the parent undertaking;
(d)
the parent undertaking satisfies the competent authority regarding the prudent management of the subsidiary and has declared, with the consent of the competent authority, that it guarantees the commitments entered into by the subsidiary, or the risks in the subsidiary are of no significance;

(f)
the parent undertaking holds more than 50 % of the voting rights attached to shares in the capital of the subsidiary or has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the management body of the subsidiary.
5.   Where the conditions laid down in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3 are met, the resolution authority of a subsidiary may permit the requirement referred to in Article 45(1) to be met in full or in part with a guarantee provided by the resolution entity, which fulfils the following conditions:
(a)
the guarantee is provided for at least an amount that is equivalent to the amount of the requirement for which it substitutes;
(b)
the guarantee is triggered when the subsidiary is unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due, or a determination has been made in accordance with Article 59(3) in respect of the subsidiary, whichever is the earliest;
(c)

(d)
the collateral backing the guarantee fulfils the requirements of Article 197 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, which, following appropriately conservative haircuts, is sufficient to cover the amount collateralised as referred to in point (c);
(e)

6.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards further specifying methods to avoid that instruments recognised for the purposes of this Article indirectly subscribed, in part or in full, by the resolution entity hamper the smooth implementation of the resolution strategy. Such methods are to ensure, in particular, the proper transfer of losses to the resolution entity and the proper transfer of capital from the resolution entity to entities that are part of the resolution group but not themselves resolution entities, and provide a mechanism to avoid double counting of eligible instruments recognised for the purpose of this Article. They shall consist of a deduction regime or an equivalently robust approach and they shall ensure to entities that are not themselves the resolution entity an outcome equivalent to that of a full direct subscription by the resolution entity of eligible instruments recognised for the purpose of this Article.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 45g
Waiver for a central body and credit institutions permanently affiliated to a central body

(a)
the credit institution and the central body are subject to supervision by the same competent authority, are established in the same Member State and are part of the same resolution group;
(b)
the commitments of the central body and its permanently affiliated credit institutions are joint and several liabilities, or the commitments of its permanently affiliated credit institutions are entirely guaranteed by the central body;
(c)
the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, and the solvency and liquidity of the central body and of all of the permanently affiliated credit institutions, are monitored as a whole on the basis of the consolidated accounts of those institutions;
(d)
in the case of a waiver for a credit institution which is permanently affiliated to a central body, the management of the central body is empowered to issue instructions to the management of the permanently affiliated institutions;
(e)
the relevant resolution group complies with the requirement referred to in Article 45e(3); and
(f)
there is no current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities between the central body and the permanently affiliated credit institutions in the event of resolution.
Article 45h
Procedure for determining the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities
1.   The resolution authority of the resolution entity, the group-level resolution authority, where different from the former, and the resolution authorities responsible for the subsidiaries of a resolution group that are subject to the requirement referred to in Article 45f on an individual basis shall do everything within their power to reach a joint decision on:
(a)
the amount of the requirement applied at the consolidated resolution group level for each resolution entity; and
(b)
the amount of the requirement applied on an individual basis to each entity of a resolution group which is not a resolution entity.
The joint decision shall ensure compliance with Articles 45e and 45f and it shall be fully reasoned and provided to:
(a)
the resolution entity by its resolution authority;
(b)
the entities of a resolution group which are not a resolution entity by the resolution authorities of those entities;
(c)
the Union parent undertaking of the group by the resolution authority of the resolution entity, when that Union parent undertaking is not itself a resolution entity from the same resolution group.
The joint decision taken in accordance with this Article may provide that, where consistent with the resolution strategy and sufficient instruments complying with Article 45f(2) have not been bought directly or indirectly by the resolution entity, the requirements referred to in Article 45c(7) are partially met by the subsidiary in compliance with Article 45f(2) with instruments issued to and bought by entities not belonging to the resolution group.
2.   Where more than one G-SII entity belonging to the same G-SII are resolution entities, the resolution authorities referred to in paragraph 1 shall discuss and, where appropriate and consistent with the G-SII's resolution strategy, agree on the application of Article 72e of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and any adjustment to minimise or eliminate the difference between the sum of the amounts referred to in point (a) of Article 45d(4) and Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for individual resolution entities and the sum of the amounts referred to in point (b) of Article 45d(4) and Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
Such an adjustment may be applied subject to the following:
(a)
the adjustment may be applied in respect of differences in the calculation of the total risk exposure amounts between the relevant Member States by adjusting the level of the requirement;
(b)
the adjustment shall not be applied to eliminate differences resulting from exposures between resolution groups.
The sum of the amounts referred to in point (a) of Article 45d(4) of this Directive and Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for individual resolution entities shall not be lower than the sum of the amounts referred to in point (b) of Article 45d(4) of this Directive and Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
3.   In the absence of such a joint decision within four months, a decision shall be taken in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 6.
4.   Where a joint decision is not taken within four months because of a disagreement concerning a consolidated resolution group requirement referred to in Article 45e, a decision shall be taken on that requirement by the resolution authority of the resolution entity after having duly taken into account:
(a)
the assessment of entities of the resolution group that are not a resolution entity, performed by the relevant resolution authorities;
(b)

The deadline for institutions and entities to comply with the requirements in Articles 45e or 45f or the requirements that result from the application of Article 45b(4), (5) or (7) shall be 1 January 2024.
The resolution authority shall determine intermediate target levels for the requirements in Articles 45e or 45f or for requirements that result from the application of Article 45b(4), (5) or (7), as appropriate, that institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) shall comply with at 1 January 2022. The intermediate target levels, as a rule, shall ensure a linear build-up of own funds and eligible liabilities towards the requirement.
The resolution authority may set a transitional period that ends after 1 January 2024 where duly justified and appropriate on the basis of the criteria referred to in paragraph 7, taking into consideration:
(a)
the development of the entity's financial situation;
(b)
the prospect that the entity will be able to ensure compliance in a reasonable timeframe with the requirements in Article 45e or 45f or with a requirement that results from the application of Article 45b(4), (5) or (7); and
(c)
whether the entity is able to replace liabilities that no longer meet the eligibility or maturity criteria laid down in Articles 72b and 72c of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and Article 45b or Article 45f(2) of this Directive, and if not, whether that inability is of an idiosyncratic nature or is due to market-wide disturbance.
2.   The deadline for resolution entities to comply with the minimum level of the requirements referred to in Article 45c(5) or (6) shall be 1 January 2022.
3.   The minimum levels of the requirements referred to in Article 45c(5) and (6) shall not apply within the two-year period following the date:
(a)
on which the resolution authority has applied the bail-in tool; or
(b)
on which the resolution entity has put in place an alternative private sector measure as referred to in point (b) of Article 32(1) by which capital instruments and other liabilities have been written down or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 instruments, or on which write down or conversion powers, in accordance with Article 59, have been exercised in respect of that resolution entity, in order to recapitalise the resolution entity without the application of resolution tools.

5.   By way of derogation from Article 45(1), resolution authorities shall determine an appropriate transitional period within which to comply with the requirements of Articles 45e or 45f, or a requirement resulting from the application of Article 45b(4), (5) or (7), as appropriate, for institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) to which resolution tools or the write-down or conversion power referred to in Article 59 have been applied.
6.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 5, resolution authorities shall communicate to the institution or entity referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) a planned minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities for each 12-month period during the transitional period, with a view to facilitating a gradual build-up of its loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity. At the end of the transitional period, the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities shall be equal to the amount determined under Article 45b(4), (5) or (7), Article 45c(5) or (6), Article 45e or Article 45f, as applicable.
7.   When determining the transitional periods, resolution authorities shall take into account:
(a)
the prevalence of deposits and the absence of debt instruments in the funding model;
(b)
the access to the capital markets for eligible liabilities;
(c)
the extent to which the resolution entity relies on Common Equity Tier 1 capital to meet the requirement referred to in Article 45e.

(21)
Article 55 is replaced by the following:
‘Article 55
Contractual recognition of bail-in
1.   Member States shall require institutions and entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) to include a contractual term by which the creditor or party to the agreement or instrument creating the liability recognises that that liability may be subject to the write down and conversion powers and agrees to be bound by any reduction of the principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation that is effected by the exercise of those powers by a resolution authority, provided that that liability complies with all of the following conditions:
(a)
the liability is not excluded under Article 44(2);
(b)
the liability is not a deposit as referred to in point (a) of Article 108;
(c)
the liability is governed by the law of a third country;
(d)
the liability is issued or entered into after the date on which a Member State applies the provisions adopted in order to transpose this Section.
Resolution authorities may decide that the obligation in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not apply to institutions or entities in respect of which the requirement under Article 45(1) equals the loss-absorption amount as defined under point (a) of Article 45c(2), provided that liabilities that meet the conditions referred to in the first subparagraph and which do not include the contractual term referred to in that subparagraph are not counted towards that requirement.
The first subparagraph shall not apply where the resolution authority of a Member State determines that the liabilities or instruments referred to in the first subparagraph can be subject to write down and conversion powers by the resolution authority of a Member State pursuant to the law of the third country or to a binding agreement concluded with that third country.
2.   Member States shall ensure that where an institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) reaches the determination that it is legally or otherwise impracticable to include in the contractual provisions governing a relevant liability a term required in accordance with paragraph 1, such institution or entity notifies its determination, including the designation of the class of the liability and the justification of that determination, to the resolution authority. The institution or entity shall provide the resolution authority with all information that the resolution authority requests, within a reasonable timeframe following the receipt of the notification, in order for the resolution authority to assess the effect of such notification on the resolvability of that institution or entity.
Member States shall ensure that, in the case of a notification under the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the obligation to include in the contractual provisions a term required in accordance with paragraph 1 is automatically suspended from the moment of receipt by the resolution authority of the notification.
In the event that the resolution authority concludes that it is not legally or otherwise impracticable to include in the contractual provisions a term required in accordance with paragraph 1, taking into account the need to ensure the resolvability of the institution or entity, it shall require, within a reasonable timeframe after the notification pursuant to the first subparagraph, the inclusion of such contractual term. The resolution authority may, in addition, require the institution or entity to amend its practices concerning the application of the exemption from contractual recognition of bail-in.
The liabilities referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not include Additional Tier 1 instruments, Tier 2 instruments and debt instruments referred to in point (48)(ii) of Article 2(1), where those instruments are unsecured liabilities. Moreover, the liabilities referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be senior to the liabilities referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 108(2) and in Article 108(3).
Where the resolution authority, in the context of the assessment of the resolvability of an institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) in accordance with Articles 15 and 16, or at any other time, determines that, within a class of liabilities which includes eligible liabilities, the amount of liabilities that, in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph, do not include the contractual term referred to in paragraph 1, together with the liabilities which are excluded from the application of the bail-in tool in accordance with Article 44(2) or which are likely to be excluded in accordance with Article 44(3) amounts to more than 10 % of that class, it shall immediately assess the impact of that particular fact on the resolvability of that institution or entity, including the impact on the resolvability resulting from the risk of breaching the creditor safeguards provided in Article 73 when applying write-down and conversion powers to eligible liabilities.
Where the resolution authority concludes, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the fifth subparagraph of this paragraph, that the liabilities which, in accordance with the first subparagraph, do not include the contractual term referred to in paragraph 1, create a substantive impediment to resolvability, it shall apply the powers provided in Article 17 as appropriate to remove that impediment to resolvability.
Liabilities for which the institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) fails to include in the contractual provisions the term required by paragraph 1 of this Article or for which, in accordance with this paragraph, that requirement does not apply, shall not be counted towards the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities.
3.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may require institutions and entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) to provide authorities with a legal opinion relating to the legal enforceability and effectiveness of the contractual term referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
4.   Where an institution or entity referred to in point (b), (c) or (d) of Article 1(1) does not include in the contractual provisions governing a relevant liability a contractual term required in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, that shall not prevent the resolution authority from exercising the write down and conversion powers in relation to that liability.
5.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards in order to further determine the list of liabilities to which the exclusion in paragraph 1 applies, and the contents of the contractual term required in that paragraph, taking into account institutions' different business models.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.

the conditions for the resolution authority to require the inclusion of the contractual term pursuant to the third subparagraph of paragraph 2;
