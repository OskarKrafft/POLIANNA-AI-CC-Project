Article 17
Co-financing
1.   Measures financed under this Regulation shall be eligible for cofinancing from the following, inter alia:

(a)
Member States, their regional and local authorities and their public and parastatal agencies;
(b)
EEA countries, Switzerland and other donor countries, and in particular their public and parastatal agencies;
(c)
international organisations, including regional organisations, and in particular international and regional financial institutions;
(d)
companies, firms, other private organisations and businesses, and other non-state actors;
(e)
partner countries and regions in receipt of funding.
2.   In the case of parallel cofinancing, the project or programme is split into a number of clearly identifiable sub-projects which are each financed by the different partners providing cofinancing in such a way that the end-use of the financing can always be identified. In the case of joint cofinancing, the total cost of the project or programme is shared between the partners providing the cofinancing, and resources are pooled in such a way that it is not possible to identify the source of funding for any given activity undertaken as part of the project or programme.
3.   In the case of joint cofinancing, the Commission may receive and manage funds on behalf of the bodies referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (c) for the purpose of implementing joint measures. Such funds shall be treated as assigned revenue, in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.
