Article 10
1. If the Member State which has conducted type-approval finds that vehicles, systems, separate technical units or components do not conform to the approved type, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the production of any item that has been type-approved is again in conformity. The competent authorities in that Member State shall inform the authorities in the other Member States of the measures taken which may, where necessary, extend to the withdrawal of type-approval.
2. If a Member State finds that vehicles, systems, separate technical units or components do not conform to the approved type, it may request the Member State which has conducted the type-approval to verify the irregularities found. Any Member State which has conducted type-approval shall conduct the necessary check within six months following the date of receipt of that request. Should a failure to conform be established, the competent authorities in the Member State which has conducted type-approval shall take the measures set out in paragraph 1.
3. The competent authorities in the Member States shall inform each other, within one month, of the withdrawal of any type-approval granted and of the reasons for such measure.
4. If the Member State which has granted type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States involved shall endeavour to resolve the matter. The Commission shall be kept informed and, where necessary, shall hold appropriate consultations in order to reach a settlement.
