Article 16
1. By way of derogation from Article 15(1) and (2), and within the limits set out in Annex VIII, Member States may, for a limited period, register and permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles conforming to a type of vehicle whose type-approval is no longer valid. This option shall be limited to a period of 12 months as from the date on which the type-approval lost its validity.
The first subparagraph shall apply only to vehicles which were in the territory of the Community and were accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity which had been issued when the type-approval of the vehicle in question was still valid, but which had not been registered or put into service before the said type-approval lost its validity.
2. Before paragraph 1 may be applied to one or more types of a given category, the manufacturer shall submit a request to the competent authority of each Member State concerned by the entry into service of such types of vehicle. The request shall specify the technical and/or economic reasons justifying it.
Within three months such Member States shall decide whether, and for how many units, they will accept the vehicle type concerned for registration in their territory. Each Member State concerned by the entry into service of such types of vehicle shall be responsible for ensuring that the manufacturer complies with the provisions of Annex VIII. Member States shall send the Commission every year a list of exemptions granted.
3. As regards vehicles, components or separate technical units incorporating technologies or concepts which cannot, due to their specific nature, comply with one or more of the requirements of one or more of the separate Directives, point (c) of Article 8(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC shall apply.
