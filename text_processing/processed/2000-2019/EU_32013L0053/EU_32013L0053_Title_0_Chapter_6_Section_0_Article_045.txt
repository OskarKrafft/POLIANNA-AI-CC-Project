Article 45
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 44(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators or the private importer and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified or not.
The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators or the private importer.
2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.
3.   Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 44(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall apply the procedure of Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
