Article 18
Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the products referred to in Article 17(1). In case of components, where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the size or nature of that product, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents. In the case of watercraft, the CE marking shall be affixed on the watercraft builder’s plate mounted separately from the watercraft identification number. In the case of a propulsion engine, the CE marking shall be affixed on the engine.
2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the product is placed on the market or put into service. The CE marking, and the identification number referred to in paragraph 3, may be followed by a pictogram or any other mark indicating a special risk or use.
3.   The CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body, where that body is involved in the production control phase or in the post-construction assessment.
The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or his authorised representative, or by the person referred to in Article 19(2), (3) or (4).
