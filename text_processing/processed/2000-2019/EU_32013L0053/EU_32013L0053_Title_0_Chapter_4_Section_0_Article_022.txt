Article 22
Noise emissions
1.   With regard to noise emissions for recreational craft with stern drive propulsion engines without integral exhausts or inboard propulsion engine installations and for recreational craft with stern drive propulsion engines without integral exhausts or with inboard propulsion engine installations which are subject to major craft conversion and subsequently placed on the market within five years following conversion, the manufacturer shall apply the following procedures set out in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC:
(a)
where tests are conducted using the harmonised standard for noise measurement, any of the following modules:
(i)
Module A1 (internal production control plus supervised product testing);
(ii)
Module G (conformity based on unit verification);
(iii)
Module H (conformity based on full quality assurance).
(b)
Where tests are conducted without using the harmonised standard for noise measurement, Module G (conformity based on unit verification).
(c)
Where the Froude number and power displacement ratio method is used for assessment, any of the following modules:
(i)
Module A (internal production control);
(ii)
Module G (conformity based on unit verification);
(iii)
Module H (conformity based on full quality assurance).
2.   With regard to noise emissions for personal watercraft and outboard propulsion engines and stern drive propulsion engines with integral exhausts intended for installation on recreational craft, the personal watercraft or engine manufacturer shall apply the following procedures set out in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC:
(a)
Where tests are conducted using the harmonised standard for noise measurement, any of the following modules:
(i)
Module A1 (internal production control plus supervised product testing);
(ii)
Module G (conformity based on unit verification);
(iii)
Module H (conformity based on full quality assurance).
(b)
Where tests are conducted without using the harmonised standard for noise measurement, Module G (conformity based on unit verification).
