Article 52
Review
By 18 January 2022 the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the following:
(a)
the technical feasibility for further reducing the emissions of marine propulsion engines and introducing requirements for evaporative emmissions and fuel systems that apply to propulsion engines and systems taking into account the cost efficiency of technologies and the need to agree globally harmonised values for the sector, taking into account any major market initiatives; and
(b)
the impact on consumer information and on manufacturers, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, of the watercraft design categories listed in Annex I, which are based on resistance to wind force and significant wave height, taking into account developments in international standardisation. That report shall include an evaluation of whether the watercraft design categories require additional specifications or subdivisions, and shall suggest additional sub categories, as appropriate.
The reports referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first paragraph shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by legislative proposals.
