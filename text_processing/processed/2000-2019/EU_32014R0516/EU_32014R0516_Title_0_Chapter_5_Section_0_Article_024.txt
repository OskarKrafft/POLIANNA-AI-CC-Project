Article 24
Coordination
The Commission and the Member States, together with the European External Action Service where appropriate, shall ensure that actions in and in relation to third countries are taken in synergy and in coherence with other actions outside the Union supported through Union instruments. They shall, in particular, ensure that those actions:
(a)
are coherent with the Union’s external policy, respect the principle of policy coherence for development and are consistent with the strategic programming documents for the region or country in question;
(b)
focus on non-development-oriented measures;
(c)
serve the interests of the Union’s internal policies and are consistent with activities undertaken inside the Union.
