Article 18
Resources for the transfer of beneficiaries of international protection
1.   With a view to implementing the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility and in the light of Union policy developments within the implementation period of the Fund, Member States shall receive, in addition to their allocation calculated in accordance with point (a) of Article 15(1), an additional amount as set out in point (b) of Article 15(2) based on a lump sum of EUR 6 000 for each beneficiary of international protection transferred from another Member State.
2.   Member States may also be eligible for lump sums for family members of persons referred to in paragraph 1, where appropriate, provided that those family members have been transferred in accordance with this Regulation.
3.   The additional amounts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be allocated to the Member States for the first time in the individual financing decisions approving their national programme in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 and later in a financing decision to be annexed to the decision approving their national programme. Those amounts shall not be transferred to other actions under the national programme.
4.   To effectively pursue the objectives of solidarity and responsibility sharing between the Member States referred to in Article 80 TFEU, and within the limits of available resources, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 26 of this Regulation to adjust the lump sum referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in particular taking into account the current rates of inflation, relevant developments in the field of transfer of beneficiaries of international protection from one Member State to another, as well as factors which can optimise the use of the financial incentive brought by the lump sums.
