Article 44
International relations
1.   In so far as is necessary in order to achieve the objectives set out in this Regulation, and without prejudice to the respective competences of the Member States, the institutions of the Union and the European External Action Service, the Agency may strengthen coordination with international organisations on the basis of concluded agreements and develop contacts and enter into administrative arrangements with supervisory authorities, international organisations and the administrations of third countries competent in matters covered by Agency activities in order to keep up with scientific and technical developments and to ensure promotion of the Union railways legislation and standards.
2.   The arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 shall not create legal obligations incumbent on the Union and its Member States, nor shall they prevent Member States and their competent authorities from concluding bilateral or multilateral arrangements with the supervisory authorities, international organisations and the administrations of third countries referred to in paragraph 1. Such bilateral or multilateral arrangements and cooperation shall be subject to prior discussion with the Commission and periodical reporting to it. The Management Board shall be duly informed of those bilateral or multilateral arrangements.
3.   The Management Board shall adopt a strategy for relations with third countries or international organisations concerning matters for which the Agency is competent. That strategy shall be included in the programming document of the Agency, with a specification of associated resources.
