Article 31
Supporting ERTMS deployment and ERTMS projects
1.   The Agency shall assist the Commission in monitoring the deployment of the ERTMS in accordance with the European deployment plan in force. At the Commission's request, it shall facilitate the coordination of ERTMS deployment along the Trans-European Transport Corridors and Rail Freight Corridors as provided for in Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18).
2.   The Agency shall ensure technical follow-up of Union-funded projects for the deployment of the ERTMS, including, where applicable and without causing undue delay to the process, analysis of tendering documents at the time of the call for tenders. The Agency shall also, if necessary, assist the beneficiaries of those Union funds to ensure that the technical solutions implemented within projects are fully compliant with the TSIs relating to control-command and signalling and are therefore fully interoperable.
