Article 58
Appeals against decisions and failures to act
1.   An appeal may be brought before a Board of Appeal against a decision taken by the Agency pursuant to Articles 14, 20, 21 and 22 or if the Agency fails to act within the applicable time limits, following completion of the interlocutory revision referred to in Article 60.
2.   An appeal lodged pursuant to paragraph 1 shall not have suspensory effect. However, upon request by the parties involved, the Board of Appeal may decide that the appeal in question is to have suspensory effect, if it considers that circumstances, such as impact on safety, so permit. In such a case, the Board of Appeal shall provide a statement of reasons for its decision.
