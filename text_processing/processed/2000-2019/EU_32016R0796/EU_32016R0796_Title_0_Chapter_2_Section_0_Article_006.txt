Article 6
Consultation of the social partners
Whenever the tasks provided for in Articles 13, 15, 19, and 36 have a direct impact on the social environment or working conditions of workers in the industry, the Agency shall consult the social partners within the framework of the sectoral dialogue committee set up pursuant to Commission Decision 98/500/ECÂ (15). In such cases, the social partners may react to those consultations, provided that they do so within 3 months.
Those consultations shall be held before the Agency addresses its recommendations to the Commission. The Agency shall take due account of those consultations, and shall, at all times, be available to expound on its recommendations. The opinions expressed by the sectoral dialogue committee shall be forwarded by the Agency, together with the recommendation by the Agency, to the Commission and by the Commission to the committee.
