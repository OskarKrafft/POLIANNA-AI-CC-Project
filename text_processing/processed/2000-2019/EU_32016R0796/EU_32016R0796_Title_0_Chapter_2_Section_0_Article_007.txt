Article 7
Consultation of rail freight customers and passengers
Whenever the tasks provided for in Articles 13 and 19 have a direct impact on rail freight customers and passengers, the Agency shall consult the organisations representing them, including representatives of persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility. In such cases, those organisations may react to those consultations, provided that they do so within 3 months.
The list of organisations to be consulted shall be drawn up by the Commission with the assistance of the committee.
Those consultations shall be held before the Agency addresses its recommendations to the Commission. The Agency shall take due account of those consultations, and shall, at all times, be available to expound on its recommendations. The opinions expressed by the organisations concerned shall be forwarded by the Agency, together with the recommendation by the Agency, to the Commission and by the Commission to the committee.
