Assistance with the assessment of rail projects
Without prejudice to the derogations provided for by Article 7 of Directive (EU) 2016/797, the Agency shall, at the Commission's request, examine, from the point of view of railway safety and interoperability, any project involving the design, construction, renewal or upgrading of any subsystem in respect of which an application for Union financial support has been submitted.
