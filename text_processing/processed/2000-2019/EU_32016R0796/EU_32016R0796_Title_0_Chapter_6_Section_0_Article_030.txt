Article 30
Compatibility between ERTMS on-board and trackside subsystems
1.   The Agency shall decide to:
(a)
without prejudice to Article 21(5) of Directive (EU) 2016/797, and before issuing an authorisation for the placing on the market of a vehicle equipped with an ERTMS on-board subsystem, advise applicants at their request, on the technical compatibility between ERTMS on-board and trackside subsystems;
(b)
without prejudice to Article 17 of Directive (EU) 2016/798, and after issuing an authorisation for the placing on the market of a vehicle equipped with an ERTMS on-board subsystem, advise railway undertakings at their request, before they use a vehicle equipped with an ERTMS on-board subsystem, on the operational compatibility between ERTMS on-board and trackside subsystems.
For the purposes of this paragraph, the Agency shall cooperate with the relevant national safety authorities.
2.   Where, before an authorisation is issued by the national safety authority, the Agency becomes aware or is informed by the applicant through the one-stop shop in accordance with Article 19(6) of Directive (EU) 2016/797 that a project design or specification was changed after the Agency had issued an approval in accordance with Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2016/797 and that there is a risk of a lack of technical and operational compatibility between the ERTMS trackside subsystem and vehicles fitted with ERTMS, it shall cooperate with the parties involved, including the applicant and the relevant national safety authority, in order to find a mutually acceptable solution. If no mutually acceptable solution can be found within 1 month of the beginning of the coordination process, the matter shall be referred to the Board of Appeal for arbitration.
3.   Where the Agency finds after an authorisation is issued by the national safety authority that there is a risk of a lack of technical or operational compatibility between the relevant networks and vehicles fitted with ERTMS equipment, the national safety authority and the Agency shall cooperate with all parties involved in order to find, without delay, a mutually acceptable solution. The Agency shall inform the Commission about such cases.
