Article 49
Meetings
1.   Meetings of the Management Board shall be conducted in accordance with its rules of procedure and convened by its chairperson. The Executive Director of the Agency shall participate in the meetings, except when his or her participation may lead to a conflict of interests, as decided by the chairperson, or when the Management Board is to take a decision relating to Article 70, in accordance with point (i) of Article 51(1).
The Management Board may invite any person whose opinion may be of interest to attend specific agenda items of its meetings as an observer.
2.   The Management Board shall meet at least twice a year. It shall also meet on the initiative of the chairperson or at the request of the Commission, of a majority of its members, or of one-third of the Member States' representatives on the Board.
3.   When a matter of confidentiality or a conflict of interest arises, the Management Board may decide to examine specific items on its agenda without the members concerned being present. This does not affect the right of the Member States and of the Commission to be represented by an alternate or by any other person. Detailed rules for the application of this provision shall be laid down in the Management Board's rules of procedure.
