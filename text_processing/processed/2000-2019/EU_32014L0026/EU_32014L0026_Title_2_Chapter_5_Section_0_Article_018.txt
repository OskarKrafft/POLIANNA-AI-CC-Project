1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article and Article 19 and Article 28(2), Member States shall ensure that a collective management organisation makes available, not less than once a year, to each rightholder to whom it has attributed rights revenue or made payments in the period to which the information relates, at least the following information:
(a)
any contact details which the rightholder has authorised the collective management organisation to use in order to identify and locate the rightholder;
(b)
the rights revenue attributed to the rightholder;
(c)
the amounts paid by the collective management organisation to the rightholder per category of rights managed and per type of use;
(d)
the period during which the use took place for which amounts were attributed and paid to the rightholder, unless objective reasons relating to reporting by users prevent the collective management organisation from providing this information;
(e)
deductions made in respect of management fees;
(f)
deductions made for any purpose other than in respect of management fees, including those that may be required by national law for the provision of any social, cultural or educational services;
(g)
any rights revenue attributed to the rightholder which is outstanding for any period.
2.   Where a collective management organisation attributes rights revenue and has as members entities which are responsible for the distribution of rights revenue to rightholders, the collective management organisation shall provide the information listed in paragraph 1 to those entities, provided that they do not have that information in their possession. Member States shall ensure that the entities make at least the information listed in paragraph 1 available, not less than once a year, to each rightholder to whom they have attributed rights revenue or made payments in the period to which the information relates.
