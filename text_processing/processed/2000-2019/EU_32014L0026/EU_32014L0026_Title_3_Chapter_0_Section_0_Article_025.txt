Article 25
Transparency of multi-territorial repertoire information
1.   Member States shall ensure that a collective management organisation which grants multi-territorial licences for online rights in musical works provides to online service providers, to rightholders whose rights it represents and to other collective management organisations, by electronic means, in response to a duly justified request, up-to-date information allowing the identification of the online music repertoire it represents. This shall include:
(a)
the musical works represented;
(b)
the rights represented wholly or in part; and
(c)
the territories covered.
2.   The collective management organisation may take reasonable measures, where necessary, to protect the accuracy and integrity of the data, to control their reuse and to protect commercially sensitive information.
