Article 1
Scope
The objective of this Regulation is to contain, prevent and thereby reduce emissions of the fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol. It shall apply to the fluorinated greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to that Protocol. Annex I to this Regulation contains a list of the fluorinated greenhouse gases currently covered by this Regulation, together with their global warming potentials. In the light of revisions provided for by Article 5(3) of the Kyoto Protocol and accepted by the Community and its Member States, Annex I may be reviewed and if appropriate may then be updated.
This Regulation addresses the containment, use, recovery and destruction of the fluorinated greenhouse gases listed in Annex I; the labelling and disposal of products and equipment containing those gases; the reporting of information on those gases; the control of uses referred to in Article 8 and the placing on the market prohibitions of the products and equipment referred to in Article 9 and Annex II; and the training and certification of personnel and companies involved in activities provided for by this Regulation.
This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to Directives 75/442/EEC, 96/61/EC, 2000/53/EC and 2002/96/EC.
