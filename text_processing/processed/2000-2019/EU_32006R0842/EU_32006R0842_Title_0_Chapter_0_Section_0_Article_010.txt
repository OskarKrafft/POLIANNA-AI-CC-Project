Article 10
Review
1.   On the basis of progress in potential containment or replacement of fluorinated greenhouse gases in air conditioning systems, other than those fitted to motor vehicles referred to in Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of laws relating to the type‐approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (19), and in refrigeration systems contained in modes of transport, the Commission shall review this Regulation and publish a report by 31 December 2007 at the latest. It shall, if appropriate, accompany this report with legislative proposals by 31 December 2008, with a view to applying the provisions of Article 3 to air-conditioning systems, other than those fitted to motor vehicles referred to in Directive 70/156/EEC, and refrigeration systems contained in modes of transport.
2.   By 4 July 2011, the Commission shall publish a report based on the experience of the application of this Regulation. In particular, the report shall:
(a)
assess the impact of relevant provisions on emissions and projected emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases and examine the cost-effectiveness of these provisions;
(b)
in the light of future assessment reports of the IPCC, assess whether additional fluorinated greenhouse gases should be added to Annex I;
(c)
evaluate the training and certification programmes established by Member States under Article 5(2);
(d)
assess the need for Community standards relating to the control of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases from products and equipment, in particular as regards foam, including technical requirements with respect to the design of products and equipment;
(e)
evaluate the effectiveness of containment measures carried out by operators under Article 3 and assess whether maximum leakage rates for installations can be established;
(f)
assess and, if appropriate, may propose a modification of the reporting requirements in Article 6(1), in particular the one tonne quantitative limit, and assess the need for the competent authorities to report periodically to the Commission estimated emissions based on representative samples to improve the practical application of those reporting requirements;
(g)
assess the need for the development and dissemination of notes describing best available techniques and best environmental practices concerning the prevention and minimisation of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases;
(h)
include an overall summary of the development, both within the Community and at an international level, of the state of technology, in particular as regards foams, experience gained, environmental requirements and any impacts on the functioning of the internal market;
(i)
assess whether the substitution of sulphur hexafluoride in sand casting, permanent mould casting and high-pressure die-casting is technically feasible and cost-effective and, if appropriate, propose a revision of Article 8(1) by 1 January 2009; it shall also review the exemption contained in Article 8(1) in the light of further assessment of the available alternatives by 1 January 2010;
(j)
assess whether the inclusion of further products and equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gases in Annex II is technically feasible and cost-effective, taking account of energy-efficiency, and, if appropriate, make proposals to amend Annex II in order to include such further products and equipment;
(k)
assess whether Community provisions concerning the global warming potential of fluorinated greenhouse gases should be amended; any changes should take account of technological and scientific developments and the need to respect industrial product planning timescales;
(l)
assess the need for further action by the Community and its Member States in the light of existing and new international commitments regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
3.   Where necessary, the Commission shall present appropriate proposals for revision of the relevant provisions of this Regulation.
