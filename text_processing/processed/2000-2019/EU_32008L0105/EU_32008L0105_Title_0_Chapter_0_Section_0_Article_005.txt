Article 5
Inventory of emissions, discharges and losses
1.   On the basis of the information collected in accordance with Articles 5 and 8 of Directive 2000/60/EC, under Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 and other available data, Member States shall establish an inventory, including maps, if available, of emissions, discharges and losses of all priority substances and pollutants listed in Part A of Annex I to this Directive for each river basin district or part of a river basin district lying within their territory including their concentrations in sediment and biota, as appropriate.
2.   The reference period for the estimation of pollutant values to be entered in the inventories referred to in paragraph 1 shall be one year between 2008 and 2010.
However, for priority substances or pollutants covered by Directive 91/414/EEC, the entries may be calculated as the average of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010.
3.   Member States shall communicate the inventories established pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, including the respective reference periods, to the Commission in accordance with the reporting requirements under Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC.
4.   Member States shall update their inventories as part of the reviews of the analyses specified in Article 5(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC.
The reference period for the establishment of values in the updated inventories shall be the year before that analysis is to be completed. For priority substances or pollutants covered by Directive 91/414/EEC, the entries may be calculated as the average of the three years before the completion of that analysis.
Member States shall publish the updated inventories in their updated river basin management plans as laid down in Article 13(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC.
5.   The Commission shall, by 2018, verify that emissions, discharges and losses as reflected in the inventory are making progress towards compliance with the reduction or cessation objectives laid down in Article 4(1)(a)(iv) of Directive 2000/60/EC, subject to Article 4(4) and (5) of that Directive.
6.   Technical guidelines for the establishment of inventories shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 9(2) of this Directive.
