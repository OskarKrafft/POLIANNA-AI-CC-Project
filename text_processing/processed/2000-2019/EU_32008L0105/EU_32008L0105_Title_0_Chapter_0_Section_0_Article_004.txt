Article 4
Mixing zones
1.   Member States may designate mixing zones adjacent to points of discharge. Concentrations of one or more substances listed in Part A of Annex I may exceed the relevant EQS within such mixing zones if they do not affect the compliance of the rest of the body of surface water with those standards.
2.   Member States that designate mixing zones shall include in river basin management plans produced in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2000/60/EC a description of:
(a)
the approaches and methodologies applied to define such zones; and
(b)
measures taken with a view to reducing the extent of the mixing zones in the future, such as those pursuant to Article 11(3)(k) of Directive 2000/60/EC or by reviewing permits referred to in Directive 2008/1/EC or prior regulations referred to in Article 11(3)(g) of Directive 2000/60/EC.
3.   Member States that designate mixing zones shall ensure that the extent of any such zone is:
(a)
restricted to the proximity of the point of discharge;
(b)
proportionate, having regard to the concentrations of pollutants at the point of discharge and to the conditions on emissions of pollutants contained in the prior regulations, such as authorisations and/or permits, referred to in Article 11(3)(g) of Directive 2000/60/EC and any other relevant Community law, in accordance with the application of best available techniques and Article 10 of Directive 2000/60/EC, in particular after those prior regulations are reviewed.
4.   Technical guidelines for the identification of mixing zones shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 9(2) of this Directive.
