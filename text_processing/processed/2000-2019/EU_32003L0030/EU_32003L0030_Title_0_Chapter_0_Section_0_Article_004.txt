Article 4
1. Member States shall report to the Commission, before 1 July each year, on:
- the measures taken to promote the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels to replace diesel or petrol for transport purposes,
- the national resources allocated to the production of biomass for energy uses other than transport, and
- the total sales of transport fuel and the share of biofuels, pure or blended, and other renewable fuels placed on the market for the preceding year. Where appropriate, Member States shall report on any exceptional conditions in the supply of crude oil or oil products that have affected the marketing of biofuels and other renewable fuels.
In their first report following the entry into force of this Directive, Member States shall indicate the level of their national indicative targets for the first phase. In the report covering the year 2006, Member States shall indicate their national indicative targets for the second phase.
In these reports, differentiation of the national targets, as compared to the reference values referred to in Article 3(1)(b), shall be motivated and could be based on the following elements:
(a) objective factors such as the limited national potential for production of biofuels from biomass;
(b) the amount of resources allocated to the production of biomass for energy uses other than transport and the specific technical or climatic characteristics of the national market for transport fuels;
(c) national policies allocating comparable resources to the production of other transport fuels based on renewable energy sources and consistent with the objectives of this Directive.
2. By 31 December 2006 at the latest, and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall draw up an evaluation report for the European Parliament and for the Council on the progress made in the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in the Member States.
This report shall cover at least the following:
(a) the cost-effectiveness of the measures taken by Member States in order to promote the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels;
(b) the economic aspects and the environmental impact of further increasing the share of biofuels and other renewable fuels;
(c) the life-cycle perspective of biofuels and other renewable fuels, with a view to indicating possible measures for the future promotion of those fuels that are climate and environmentally friendly, and that have the potential of becoming competitive and cost-efficient;
(d) the sustainability of crops used for the production of biofuels, particularly land use, degree of intensity of cultivation, crop rotation and use of pesticides;
(e) the assessment of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels with respect to their differentiating effects on climate change and their impact on CO2 emissions reduction;
(f) a review of further more long-term options concerning energy efficiency measures in transport.
On the basis of this report, the Commission shall submit, where appropriate, proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council on the adaptation of the system of targets, as laid down in Article 3(1). If this report concludes that the indicative targets are not likely to be achieved for reasons that are unjustified and/or do not relate to new scientific evidence, these proposals shall address national targets, including possible mandatory targets, in the appropriate form.
