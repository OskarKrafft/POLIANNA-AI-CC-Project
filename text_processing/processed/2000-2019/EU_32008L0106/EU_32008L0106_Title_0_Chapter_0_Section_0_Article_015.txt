Article 15
Fitness for duty
1.   For the purpose of preventing fatigue, Member States shall establish and enforce rest periods for watchkeeping personnel and require that watch systems are arranged in such a way that the efficiency of watchkeeping personnel is not impaired by fatigue and that duties are organised in such a way that the first watch at the start of a voyage and subsequent relieving watches are sufficiently rested and otherwise fit for duty.
2.   All persons who are assigned duty as officer in charge of a watch or as a rating forming part of a watch shall be allowed at least 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period.
3.   The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, one of which shall be at least six hours long.
4.   The requirements for rest periods laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 need not be maintained in the event of an emergency or drill or in other overriding operational conditions.
5.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, the minimum period of 10 hours may be reduced to not less than 6 consecutive hours provided that no such reduction shall extend beyond 2 days and at least 70 hours of rest are provided each 7-day period.
6.   Member States shall require that watch schedules be posted where they are easily accessible.
