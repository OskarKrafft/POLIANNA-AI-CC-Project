Article 13
1. Member States shall ensure that homeopathic medicinal products manufactured and placed on the market within the Community are registered or authorized in accordance with Articles 14, 15 and 16, except where the products are covered by a registration or authorization which was granted under national law on or before 31 December 1993 (and whether or not that registration or authorization has been renewed after that date). Each Member State shall take due account of registrations and authorizations previously granted by another Member State.
2. A Member State may refrain from establishing a special, simplified registration procedure for the homeopathic medicinal products referred to in Article 14. A Member State shall inform the Commission accordingly. The Member State concerned shall allow the use in its territory of homeopathic medicinal products registered by other Member States in accordance with Articles 14 and 15.
