Article 81
With regard to the supply of medicinal products to pharmacists and persons authorized or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public, Member States shall not impose upon the holder of a distribution authorization which has been granted by another Member State, any obligation, in particular public service obligations, more stringent than those they impose on persons whom they have themselves authorized to engage in equivalent activities.
The said obligations should, moreover, be justified, in keeping with the Treaty, on grounds of public health protection and be proportionate in relation to the objective of such protection.
