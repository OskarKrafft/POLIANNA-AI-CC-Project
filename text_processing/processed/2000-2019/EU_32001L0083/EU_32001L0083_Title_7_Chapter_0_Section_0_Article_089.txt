Article 89
1. Without prejudice to Article 88, all advertising to the general public of a medicinal product shall:
(a) be set out in such a way that it is clear that the message is an advertisement and that the product is clearly identified as a medicinal product;
(b) include the following minimum information:
- the name of the medicinal product, as well as the common name if the medicinal product contains only one active substance,
- the information necessary for correct use of the medicinal product,
- an express, legible invitation to read carefully the instructions on the package leaflet or on the outer packaging, as the case may be.
2. Member States may decide that the advertising of a medicinal product to the general public may, notwithstanding paragraph 1, include only the name of the medicinal product if it is intended solely as a reminder.
