Article 122
Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the competent authorities concerned communicate to each other such information as is appropriate to guarantee that the requirements for the manufacturing authorizations or marketing authorizations are fulfilled.
Upon reasoned request, Member States shall forthwith communicate the reports referred to in Article 111(3) to the competent authorities of another Member State. If, after considering the reports, the Member State receiving the reports considers that it cannot accept the conclusions reached by the competent authorities of the Member State in which the report was established, it shall inform the competent authorities concerned of its reasons and may request further information. The Member States concerned shall use their best endeavours to reach agreement. If necessary, in the case of serious differences of opinion, the Commission shall be informed by one of the Member States concerned.
