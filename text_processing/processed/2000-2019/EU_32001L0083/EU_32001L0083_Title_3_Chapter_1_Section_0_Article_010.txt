Article 10
1. In derogation of Article 8(3)(i), and without prejudice to the law relating to the protection of industrial and commercial property:
(a) The applicant shall not be required to provide the results of toxicological and pharmacological tests or the results of clinical trials if he can demonstrate:
(i) either that the medicinal product is essentially similar to a medicinal product authorized in the Member State concerned by the application and that the holder of the marketing authorization for the original medicinal product has consented to the toxicological, pharmacological and/or clinical references contained in the file on the original medicinal product being used for the purpose of examining the application in question;
(ii) or that the constituent or constituents of the medicinal product have a well established medicinal use, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, by means of a detailed scientific bibliography;
(iii) or that the medicinal product is essentially similar to a medicinal product which has been authorized within the Community, in accordance with Community provisions in force, for not less than six years and is marketed in the Member State for which the application is made. This period shall be extended to 10 years in the case of high-technology medicinal products having been authorised according to the procedure laid down in Article 2(5) of Council Directive 87/22/EEC(21). Furthermore, a Member State may also extend this period to 10 years by a single Decision covering all the medicinal products marketed on its territory where it considers this necessary in the interest of public health. Member States are at liberty not to apply the six-year period beyond the date of expiry of a patent protecting the original medicinal product.
However, where the medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use from that of the other medicinal products marketed or is to be administered by different routes or in different doses, the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of appropriate clinical trials must be provided.
(b) In the case of new medicinal products containing known constituents not hitherto used in combination for therapeutic purposes, the results of toxicological and pharmacological tests and of clinical trials relating to that combination must be provided, but it shall not be necessary to provide references relating to each individual constituent.
2. Annex I shall apply by analogy where, pursuant to point (ii) of paragraph 1, (a), bibliographic references to published data are submitted.
