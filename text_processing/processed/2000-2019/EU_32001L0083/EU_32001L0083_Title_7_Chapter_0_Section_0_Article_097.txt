Article 97
1. Member States shall ensure that there are adequate and effective methods to monitor the advertising of medicinal products. Such methods, which may be based on a system of prior vetting, shall in any event include legal provisions under which persons or organizations regarded under national law as having a legitimate interest in prohibiting any advertisement inconsistent with this Title, may take legal action against such advertisement, or bring such advertisement before an administrative authority competent either to decide on complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings.
2. Under the legal provisions referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall confer upon the courts or administrative authorities powers enabling them, in cases where they deem such measures to be necessary, taking into account all the interests involved, and in particular the public interest:
- to order the cessation of, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the cessation of, misleading advertising, or
- if misleading advertising has not yet been published but publication is imminent, to order the prohibition of, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the prohibition of, such publication,
even without proof of actual loss or damage or of intention or negligence on the part of the advertiser.
3. Member States shall make provision for the measures referred to in the second subparagraph to be taken under an accelerated procedure, either with interim effect or with definitive effect.
It shall be for each Member State to decide which of the two options set out in the first subparagraph to select.
4. Member States may confer upon the courts or administrative authorities powers enabling them, with a view to eliminating the continuing effects of misleading advertising the cessation of which has been ordered by a final decision:
- to require publication of that decision in full or in part and in such form as they deem adequate,
- to require in addition the publication of a corrective statement.
5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not exclude the voluntary control of advertising of medicinal products by self-regulatory bodies and recourse to such bodies, if proceedings before such bodies are possible in addition to the judicial or administrative proceedings referred to in paragraph 1.
