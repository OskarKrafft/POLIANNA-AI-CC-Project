Article 10
Working plan
In accordance with the objectives set out in Article 1, the Commission shall establish a working plan within six months from the entry into force of this Regulation and propose it to the European Parliament and the Council, following consultation of the ECESB. The working plan shall include a strategy for the development of the Energy Star programme, which shall set out for the subsequent three years:
- the objectives for the energy efficiency improvements, bearing in mind the need to pursue a high standard of consumer and environmental protection and the market penetration which the Energy Star programme should seek to achieve at Community level,
- a non-exhaustive list of office equipment products which should be considered as priorities for inclusion in the Energy Star programme,
- outline proposals for educational and promotional campaigns and other necessary actions,
- proposals for coordination and cooperation between the Energy Star programme and other voluntary energy labelling schemes in Member States.
The working plan shall be reviewed periodically. It shall be reviewed for the first time at the latest 12 months after it is submitted to the European Parliament and the Council, and subsequently at 12-monthly intervals.
