Article 6
Promotion and information
1. The Commission shall make the maximum effort to encourage, in cooperation with the Member States and the members of the ECESB, the use of the common logo by appropriate awareness-raising actions and information campaigns for consumers, suppliers, dealers and the general public.
2. Each Member State shall seek to ensure that consumers and other interested bodies are made aware of, and have access to, detailed information on the Energy Star programme, using all possible Community tools.
3. In order to encourage the purchase of office equipment products with the common logo, the Commission and other Community institutions, as well as other public authorities at national level, shall, without prejudice to Community and national law and economic criteria, encourage the use of energy-efficient requirements not less demanding than the Energy Star specifications when defining their requirements for office equipment products.
