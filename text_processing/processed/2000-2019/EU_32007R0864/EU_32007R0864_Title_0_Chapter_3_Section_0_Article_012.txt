Article 12

Culpa in contrahendo

1.   The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of dealings prior to the conclusion of a contract, regardless of whether the contract was actually concluded or not, shall be the law that applies to the contract or that would have been applicable to it had it been entered into.
2.   Where the law applicable cannot be determined on the basis of paragraph 1, it shall be:
(a)
the law of the country in which the damage occurs, irrespective of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred and irrespective of the country or countries in which the indirect consequences of that event occurred; or
(b)
where the parties have their habitual residence in the same country at the time when the event giving rise to the damage occurs, the law of that country; or
(c)
where it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that the non-contractual obligation arising out of dealings prior to the conclusion of a contract is manifestly more closely connected with a country other than that indicated in points (a) and (b), the law of that other country.
