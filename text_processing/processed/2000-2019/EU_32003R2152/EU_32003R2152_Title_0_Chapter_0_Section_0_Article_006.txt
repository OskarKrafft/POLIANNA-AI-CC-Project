Article 6
1. For the realisation of the objectives set out in Article 1(1)(b) the scheme shall be developed by means of studies, experiments, demonstration projects, testing on a pilot basis and establishment of new monitoring activities. The Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States, develop the scheme, in particular to:
(a) enhance the knowledge of the condition of forests and other wooded land as well as the relationship between their condition and natural and anthropogenic stress factors;
(b) assess impacts of climate change on forests and other wooded land, including impacts on their biological diversity and their relationship with carbon sequestration and soil;
(c) taking into account the relevant existing indicators, identify key structural and functional ecosystem elements to be used as indicators for assessing status and trends of biological diversity in forests and the protective functions of forests.
2. In parallel with the measures set out in paragraph 1, the Member States may, at the request of the Commission or on their own initiative, carry out studies, experiments, demonstration projects or a monitoring test phase.
3. The measures set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall help to identify options for the establishment of new monitoring activities under the scheme, which should contribute substantially to the information and monitoring needs within the fields listed under Article 1(1)(b). The implementation of these activities shall be considered as part of the review referred to in Article 18. When developing the scheme, the Commission shall take account of scientific as well as financial needs and restrictions.
4. Detailed rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, including decisions on the implementation of new monitoring activities, shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2).
