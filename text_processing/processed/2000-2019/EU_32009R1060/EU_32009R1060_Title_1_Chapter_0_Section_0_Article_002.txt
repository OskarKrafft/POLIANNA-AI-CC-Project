Article 2
Scope
1.   This Regulation applies to credit ratings issued by credit rating agencies registered in the Community and which are disclosed publicly or distributed by subscription.
2.   This Regulation does not apply to:
(a)
private credit ratings produced pursuant to an individual order and provided exclusively to the person who placed the order and which are not intended for public disclosure or distribution by subscription;
(b)
credit scores, credit scoring systems or similar assessments related to obligations arising from consumer, commercial or industrial relationships;
(c)
credit ratings produced by export credit agencies in accordance with point 1.3 of Part 1 of Annex VI to Directive 2006/48/EC; or
(d)
credit ratings produced by the central banks and which:
(i)
are not paid for by the rated entity;
(ii)
are not disclosed to the public;
(iii)
are issued in accordance with the principles, standards and procedures which ensure the adequate integrity and independence of credit rating activities as provided for by this Regulation; and
(iv)
do not relate to financial instruments issued by the respective central banks’ Member States.
3.   A credit rating agency shall apply for registration under this Regulation as a condition for being recognised as an External Credit Assessment Institution (ECAI) in accordance with Part 2 of Annex VI to Directive 2006/48/EC, unless it only issues the credit ratings referred to in paragraph 2.
4.   In order to ensure the uniform application of paragraph 2(d), the Commission may, upon submission of a request by a Member State, in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 38(3) and in accordance with paragraph 2(d) of this Article, adopt a decision stating that a central bank falls within the scope of that point and that its credit ratings are therefore exempt from the application of this Regulation.
The Commission shall publish on its website the list of central banks falling within the scope of paragraph 2(d) of this Article.
