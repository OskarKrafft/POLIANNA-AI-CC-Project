Article 16
Monitoring and evaluation of the EIT
1.   The EIT shall ensure that its activities, including those managed through KICs, shall be subject to continuous and systematic monitoring and periodic independent evaluation, to ensure both the highest quality of outcome, scientific excellence and the most efficient use of resources. The outcomes of the evaluations shall be made public.
2.   By June 2011 and every five years after the entry into force of a new financial framework, the Commission shall provide for an evaluation of the EIT. This shall be based on an independent external evaluation and shall examine how the EIT fulfils its mission. It shall cover all activities of the EIT and the KICs and shall assess the added value of the EIT, the impact, effectiveness, sustainability, efficiency and relevance of the activities pursued and their relationship and/or complementarity with existing national and Community policies, to support higher education, research and innovation. It shall take into account the views of stakeholders, at both European and national level.
3.   The Commission shall forward the results of the evaluation, together with its own opinion and, where appropriate, any proposals to amend this Regulation, to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. The Governing Board shall take due account of the findings of evaluations in the programmes and operations of the EIT.
