Article 24
New substances
1.   The production, import, placing on the market, use and export of new substances in Part A of Annex II are prohibited. This prohibition does not apply to new substances if they are used as feedstock or for laboratory and analytical uses, to imports for transit through the customs territory of the Community or imports under the temporary storage, customs warehousing or free zone procedure as referred to in Regulation (EC) No 450/2008, unless such imports have been assigned another customs-approved treatment or use as referred to in that Regulation, or to exports subsequent to imports already exempted.
2.   The Commission shall, if appropriate, include in Part A of Annex II substances that are included in Part B of that Annex that are found to be exported, imported, produced or put on the market in significant quantities and that are found by the Scientific Assessment Panel under the Protocol to have a significant ozone-depleting potential, and shall, if appropriate, determine possible exemptions from paragraph 1.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).
3.   In the light of relevant scientific information, the Commission shall, if appropriate, include in Part B of Annex II any substances that are not controlled substances but that are found by the Scientific Assessment Panel under the Protocol or another recognised authority of equivalent stature to have a significant ozone-depleting potential. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).
