Article 19
Measures for monitoring of illegal trade
The Commission may adopt additional measures for the monitoring of controlled substances or new substances and of products and equipment containing or relying on controlled substances placed under temporary storage, customs warehousing or free zone procedure or in transit through the customs territory of the Community and subsequently re-exported, on the basis of an evaluation of the potential risks of illegal trade linked to such movements, taking into account the environmental benefits and socioeconomic impacts of such measures.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).
