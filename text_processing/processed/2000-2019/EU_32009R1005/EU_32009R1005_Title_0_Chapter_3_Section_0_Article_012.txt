Article 12
Quarantine and pre-shipment applications and emergency uses of methyl bromide
1.   By way of derogation from Article 5(1), until 18 March 2010, methyl bromide may be placed on the market and used for quarantine and for pre-shipment applications for treatment of goods for export provided that the placing on the market and use of methyl bromide are allowed respectively under national legislation in accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC and Directive 98/8/EC.
Methyl bromide may only be used on sites approved by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned and, if economically and technically feasible, subject to the condition that at least 80 % of methyl bromide released from the consignment is recovered.
2.   The calculated level of methyl bromide which undertakings place on the market or use for their own account in the period from 1 January 2010 to 18 March 2010 shall not exceed 45 ODP tonnes.
Each undertaking shall ensure that the calculated level of methyl bromide which it places on the market or uses for its own account for quarantine and pre-shipment applications shall not exceed 21 % of the average of the calculated level of methyl bromide which it placed on the market or used for its own account for quarantine and pre-shipment in the years 2005 to 2008.
3.   In an emergency, where unexpected outbreaks of particular pests or diseases so require, the Commission may, at the request of the competent authority of a Member State, authorise the temporary production, placing on the market and use of methyl bromide, provided that the placing on the market and use of methyl bromide are allowed respectively under Directive 91/414/EEC and Directive 98/8/EC.
Such authorisation shall apply for a period not exceeding 120 days and to a quantity not exceeding 20 metric tonnes and shall specify measures to be taken to reduce emissions during use.
