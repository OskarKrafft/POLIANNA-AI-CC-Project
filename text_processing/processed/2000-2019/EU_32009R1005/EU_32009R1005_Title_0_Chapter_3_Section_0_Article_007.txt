Article 7
Production, placing on the market and use of controlled substances as feedstock
1.   By way of derogation from Articles 4 and 5, controlled substances may be produced, placed on the market and used as feedstock.
2.   Controlled substances produced or placed on the market as feedstock may only be used for that purpose. As of 1 July 2010, containers of such substances shall be labelled with a clear indication that the substance may only be used as feedstock. Where such substances are required to be labelled in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC, Directive 1999/45/EC or Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, such indication shall be included in the label referred to in those Directives or in the supplemental information part of the label as referred to in Article 25(3) of that Regulation.
The Commission may determine the form and content of the label to be used. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).
