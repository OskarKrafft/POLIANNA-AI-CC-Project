Article 13
Critical uses of halons and decommissioning of equipment containing halons
1.   By way of derogation from Article 5(1), halons may be placed on the market and used for critical uses set out in Annex VI. Halons may only be placed on the market by undertakings authorised by the competent authority of the Member State concerned to store halons for critical uses.
2.   The Commission shall review Annex VI and, if appropriate, adopt modifications and time-frames for the phasing out of the critical uses by defining cut-off dates for new applications and end dates for existing applications, taking into account the availability of technically and economically feasible alternatives or technologies that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).
3.   Fire protection systems and fire extinguishers containing halons applied in uses referred to in paragraph 1 shall be decommissioned by the end dates to be specified in Annex VI.
4.   The Commission may, at the request of the competent authority of a Member State and in accordance with the management procedure referred to in Article 25(2), grant derogations from end dates for existing applications or cut-off dates for new applications, provided those dates have been specified in Annex VI in accordance with paragraph 2, for specific cases where it is demonstrated that no technically and economically feasible alternative is available.
