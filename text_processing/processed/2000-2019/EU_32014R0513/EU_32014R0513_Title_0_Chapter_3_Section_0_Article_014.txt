Transitional provisions
1.   This Regulation shall not affect the continuation or modification, including the total or partial cancellation of the projects until their closure or the financial assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Decision 2007/125/JHA, or any other legislation applying to that assistance on 31 December 2013.
2.   When adopting decisions on co-financing under the Instrument, the Commission shall take account of measures adopted on the basis of Decision 2007/125/JHA before 20 May 2014 which have financial repercussions during the period covered by that co-financing.
3.   Sums committed for co-financing approved by the Commission between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014 for which the documents required for closure of the operations have not been sent to the Commission by the deadline for submitting the final report shall be automatically decommitted by the Commission by 31 December 2017, giving rise to the repayment of amounts unduly paid.
