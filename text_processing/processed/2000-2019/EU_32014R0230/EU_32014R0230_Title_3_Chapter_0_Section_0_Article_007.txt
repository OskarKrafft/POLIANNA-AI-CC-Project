Article 7
Exceptional assistance measures and interim response programmes
1.   Union assistance under Article 3 shall be provided through exceptional assistance measures and interim response programmes.
2.   In situations as referred to in Article 3(1), the Commission may adopt exceptional assistance measures which fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 3(3). Such an exceptional assistance measure may have a duration of up to 18 months, which may be extended twice by a further period of up to six months, up to a total maximum duration of 30 months, in the event of objective and unforeseen obstacles to its implementation, provided that there is no increase in the financial amount of the measure.
In cases of protracted crisis and conflict, the Commission may adopt a second exceptional assistance measure of a duration of up to 18 months.
The duration of the exceptional assistance measure referred to in the first subparagraph combined with the duration of that referred to in the second subparagraph shall not exceed 36 months.
3.   Where an exceptional assistance measure costs more than EUR 20 000 000, it shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014.
4.   Before adopting or extending an exceptional assistance measure costing up to EUR 20 000 000, the Commission shall inform the Council of its nature and objectives and of the financial amounts envisaged. The Commission shall likewise inform the Council before making significant substantive changes to exceptional assistance measures already adopted. The Commission shall take account of the relevant policy approach of the Council both in its planning and in its subsequent implementation of such measures, in the interests of consistency of the Union's external action.
5.   As soon as possible following the adoption of an exceptional assistance measure, and in any case within three months thereof, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council, giving an overview of the nature, context and rationale of the measure adopted, including the complementarity of that measure with the ongoing and planned Union response.
6.   The Commission may adopt interim response programmes in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 with a view to establishing or re-establishing the essential conditions necessary for the effective implementation of the Union's external cooperation policies.
Interim response programmes shall build on exceptional assistance measures.
7.   The Commission shall keep the European Parliament duly informed, in a timely manner, about its planning and the implementation of Union assistance pursuant to Article 3, including the financial amounts envisaged, and shall also inform the European Parliament when making substantial changes or extensions to that assistance.
