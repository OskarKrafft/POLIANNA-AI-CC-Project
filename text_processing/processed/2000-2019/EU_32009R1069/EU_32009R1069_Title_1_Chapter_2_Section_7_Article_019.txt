Article 19
Collection, transport and disposal
1.   The competent authority may, by way of derogation from Articles 12, 13, 14 and 21, authorise the disposal:
(a)
by burial of dead pet animals and equidae;
(b)
by burning or burial on site or by other means under official supervision which prevent the transmission of risks to public and animal health of Category 1 material referred to in Article 8(a)(v) and (b)(ii), Category 2 and Category 3 materials in remote areas;
(c)
by burning or burial on site or by other means under official supervision which prevent the transmission of risks to public and animal health of Category 1 material referred to in Article 8(b)(ii), Category 2 and Category 3 materials in areas where access is practically impossible or where access would only be possible under circumstances, related to geographical or climatic reasons or due to a natural disaster, which would pose a risk to the health and safety of the personnel carrying out the collection or where access would necessitate the use of disproportionate means of collection;
(d)
by means other than burning or burial on site, under official supervision, in the case of Category 2 and Category 3 materials which do not pose a risk to public and animal health, when the amounts of materials do not exceed a particular volume per week, this volume being determined in relation to the nature of the activities carried out and the species of origin of the animal by-products concerned;
(e)
by burning or burial on site, under conditions which prevent the transmission of risks to public and animal health, of animal by-products other than Category 1 material referred to in Article 8(a)(i) in the event of an outbreak of a notifiable disease, if transport to the nearest plant approved for processing or disposal of the animal by-products would increase the danger of propagation of health risks or, in case of a widespread outbreak of an epizootic disease, would mean that the disposal capacities of such plants were exceeded; and
(f)
by burning or burial on site, under conditions which prevent the transmission of risks to public and animal health, of bees and apiculture by-products.
2.   The animal population of a particular species in the remote areas referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall not exceed a maximum percentage of the animal population of this species in the Member State concerned.
3.   Member States shall make available to the Commission information on:
(a)
the areas that they categorise as remote areas for the purpose of applying paragraph 1(b) and the reasons for that categorisation, and updated information concerning any change to such categorisation; and
(b)
the use they make of the authorisations provided for in points (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 with respect to Category 1 and Category 2 materials.
4.   Measures for the implementation of this Article shall be laid down relating to the following:
(a)
conditions aimed at ensuring control of risks to public and animal health in the event of burning and burial on site;
(b)
the maximum percentage of the animal population as referred to in paragraph 2;
(c)
the volume of animal by-products, in relation to the nature of activities and the species of origin, as referred to in paragraph 1(d); and
(d)
the list of diseases referred to in paragraph 1(e).
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 52(4).
