suspend approvals of establishments or plants approved pursuant to this Regulation, if:

the conditions for approving or operating the establishment or plant are no longer fulfilled;

the operator can be expected to remedy the deficiencies within a reasonable period of time; and
(iii)
the potential risks to public and animal health do not require action in accordance with point (b);

(i)
the conditions for approving or operating the establishment or plant are no longer fulfilled; and
(ii)
the operator cannot be expected to remedy the deficiencies within a reasonable period of time:
—
for reasons relating to the infrastructure of the establishment or plant,
—
for reasons relating to the personal capacity of the operator or the staff under his supervision, or

(c)
impose specific conditions on establishments or plants in order to rectify existing deficiencies.
2.   The competent authority shall, as appropriate to the nature and to the gravity of the deficiencies and to the potential risks for public and animal health, temporarily or permanently prohibit operators referred to in Articles 23(1) and (3) and Article 24(1) from carrying out operations under this Regulation, as appropriate, following receipt of information indicating:
