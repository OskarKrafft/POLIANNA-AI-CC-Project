Article 7
Categorisation of animal by-products and derived products
1.   Animal by-products shall be categorised into specific categories which reflect the level of risk to public and animal health arising from those animal by-products, in accordance with the lists laid down in Articles 8, 9 and 10.
2.   Derived products shall be subject to the rules for the specific category of animal by-products from which they have been derived, unless otherwise specified in this Regulation, or provided for in measures for the implementation of this Regulation which may specify the conditions under which derived products are not subject to those rules adopted by the Commission.
3.   Articles 8, 9 and 10 may be amended in order to take into account scientific progress as regards the assessment of the level of risk, provided such progress can be identified on the basis of a risk assessment carried out by the appropriate scientific institution. However, no animal by-products listed in those Articles may be removed from those lists, only changes of categorisation or additions may be made.
4.   The measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 52(4).
