Article 44
Procedure for approval
1.   The competent authority shall approve establishments or plants only where an on site visit, prior to start-up of any activity, has demonstrated that they meet the relevant requirements laid down in accordance with Article 27.
2.   The competent authority may grant conditional approval if it appears, from the on site visit, that the establishment or plant meets all the infrastructure and equipment requirements with a view to ensuring the application of the operational procedures in compliance with this Regulation. It shall grant full approval only if it appears, from another on site visit carried out within three months of granting conditional approval, that the establishment or plant meets the other requirements referred to in paragraph 1. If clear progress has been made, but the establishment or plant still does not meet all of these requirements, the competent authority may extend conditional approval. However, conditional approval shall not exceed a total of six months.
3.   Operators shall ensure that an establishment or plant ceases to operate if the competent authority withdraws its approval or in the case of conditional approval fails to extend it or to grant full approval.
