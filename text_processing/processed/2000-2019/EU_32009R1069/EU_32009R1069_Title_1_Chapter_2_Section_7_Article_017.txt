Article 17
Research and other specific purposes
1.   The competent authority may, by way of derogation from Articles 12, 13 and 14, authorise the use of animal by-products and derived products for exhibitions, artistic activities, and for diagnostic, educational or research purposes under conditions which ensure the control of risks to public and animal health.
Such conditions shall include:
(a)
the prohibition of any subsequent use of the animal by-products or derived products for other purposes; and
(b)
the obligation to dispose of the animal by-products or derived products safely, or to re-dispatch them to their place of origin, if appropriate.
2.   In the case of risks to public and animal health which require the adoption of measures for the whole territory of the Community, in particular in the case of newly emerging risks, harmonised conditions for the import and use of the animal by-products and derived products referred to in paragraph 1 may be laid down. Such conditions may include requirements regarding storage, packaging, identification, transport and disposal.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 52(4).
