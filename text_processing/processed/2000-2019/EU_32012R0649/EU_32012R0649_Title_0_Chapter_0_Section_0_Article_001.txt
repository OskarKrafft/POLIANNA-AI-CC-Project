Article 1
Objectives
1.   The objectives of this Regulation are to:
(a)
implement the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (the ‘Convention’);
(b)
promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international movement of hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm;
(c)
contribute to the environmentally sound use of hazardous chemicals.
The objectives set out in the first subparagraph shall be achieved by facilitating the exchange of information concerning the characteristics of hazardous chemicals, by providing for a decision-making process within the Union on their import and export and by disseminating decisions to Parties and other countries as appropriate.
2.   In addition to the objectives set out in paragraph 1, this Regulation shall ensure that the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 relating to classification, labelling and packaging apply to all chemicals when they are exported from the Member States to other Parties or other countries, unless those provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those Parties or other countries.
