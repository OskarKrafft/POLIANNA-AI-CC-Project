Article 14
Review clause
Without prejudice to Directive 96/61/EC, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council before 31 December 2008 based on experience of the application of this Directive, in particular for new plants, and on the progress achieved in emission control techniques and experience in waste management. Furthermore, the report shall be based on the development of the state of technology, of experience in the operation of the plants, of environmental requirements. This report will include a specific section on the application of Annex II.1.1. and in particular on the economic and technical feasibility for existing cement kilns as referred to in the footnote to Annex II.1.1. of respecting the NOx emission limit value for new cement kilns set out in that Annex. The report shall, as appropriate, be accompanied by proposals for revision of the related provisions of this Directive. However, the Commission shall, if appropriate, propose an amendment for Annex II.3 before the said report, if major waste streams are directed to types of co-incineration plants other than those dealt with in Annex II.1 and II.2.
