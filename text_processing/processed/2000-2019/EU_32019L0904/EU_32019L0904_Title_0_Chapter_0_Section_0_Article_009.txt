Article 9
Separate collection
1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure the separate collection for recycling:
(a)
by 2025, of an amount of waste single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex equal to 77 % of such single-use plastic products placed on the market in a given year by weight;
(b)
by 2029, of an amount of waste single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex equal to 90 % of such single-use plastic products placed on the market in a given year by weight.
Single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex placed on the market in a Member State may be deemed to be equal to the amount of waste generated from such products, including as litter, in the same year in that Member State.
In order to achieve that objective, Member States may inter alia:
(a)
establish deposit-refund schemes;
(b)
establish separate collection targets for relevant extended producer responsibility schemes.
The first subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to point (a) of Article 10(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC.
2.   The Commission shall facilitate the exchange of information and sharing of best practices among Member States on the appropriate measures to meet the targets laid down in paragraph 1, inter alia, on deposit-refund schemes. The Commission shall make the results of such exchange of information and sharing of best practices publicly available.
3.   By 3 July 2020, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down the methodology for the calculation and verification of the separate collection targets laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2).
