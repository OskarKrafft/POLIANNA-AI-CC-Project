Article 7
Marking requirements
1.   Member States shall ensure that each single-use plastic product listed in Part D of the Annex placed on the market bears a conspicuous, clearly legible and indelible marking on its packaging or on the product itself informing consumers of the following:
(a)
appropriate waste management options for the product or waste disposal means to be avoided for that product, in line with the waste hierarchy; and
(b)
the presence of plastics in the product and the resulting negative impact of littering or other inappropriate means of waste disposal of the product on the environment.
The harmonised marking specifications shall be established by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 2.
2.   By 3 July 2020, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act establishing harmonised specifications for the marking referred to in paragraph 1 that:
(a)
provide that the marking of single-use plastic products listed in points (1), (2) and (3) of Part D of the Annex shall be placed on the sales and grouped packaging of those products. Where multiple sales units are grouped at the point of purchase, each sales unit shall bear a marking on its packaging. The marking shall not be required for packaging with a surface area of less than 10 cm2;
(b)
provide that the marking of single-use plastic products listed in point (4) of Part D of the Annex shall be placed on the product itself; and
(c)
consider existing sectoral voluntary approaches and pay particular attention to the need to avoid information that misleads consumers.
That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2).
3.   The provisions of this Article concerning tobacco products are in addition to those laid down in Directive 2014/40/EU.
