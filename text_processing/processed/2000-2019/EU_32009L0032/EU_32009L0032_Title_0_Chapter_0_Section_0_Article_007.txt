Article 7
1.   Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the substances listed in Annex I and intended for use as extraction solvents in foodstuffs may not be marketed unless their packaging, containers or labels carry the following particulars in such a way as to be easily visible, clearly legible and indelible:
(a)
the commercial name as indicated in Annex I;
(b)
a clear indication that the material is of a quality suitable for use for the extraction of food or food ingredients;
(c)
a reference by which the batch or lot may be identified;
(d)
the name or business name and address of the manufacturer or packer or of a seller established within the Community;
(e)
the net quantity given as units of volume;
(f)
if necessary, the special storage conditions or conditions of use.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the particulars specified in points (c), (d), (e) and (f) of that paragraph may appear only on the trade documents relating to the batch or lot which are to be supplied with or prior to the delivery.
3.   This Article shall be without prejudice to more precise or more extensive Community provisions regarding weights and measures or provisions applying to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and mixtures.
4.   Member States shall refrain from laying down requirements more detailed than those already contained in this Article concerning the manner in which the particulars provided are to be shown.
Each Member State shall, however, ensure that the sale of extraction solvents within its territory is prohibited if the particulars provided for in this Article do not appear in a language easily understood by purchasers, unless other measures have been taken to ensure that the purchaser is informed. This provision shall not prevent such particulars from being indicated in various languages.
