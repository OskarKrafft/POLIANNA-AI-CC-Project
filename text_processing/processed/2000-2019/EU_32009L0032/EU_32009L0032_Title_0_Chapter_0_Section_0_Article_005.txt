Article 5
1.   Where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing information made since this Directive was adopted, has detailed grounds for establishing that the use in foodstuffs of any substance listed in Annex I or the level of one or more of the components referred to in Article 3 contained in such substances might endanger human health although it complies with the conditions laid down in this Directive, that Member State may temporarily suspend or restrict application of the provisions in question in its territory. It shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof and give reasons for its decision.
2.   The Commission shall examine as soon as possible the evidence given by the Member State concerned and consult the Committee referred to in Article 6(1), and shall then deliver its opinion forthwith and take the appropriate measures, which may replace the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
3.   If the Commission considers that amendments to this Directive are necessary in order to resolve the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 1 and to ensure the protection of human health, it shall adopt those amendments.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the urgency procedure referred to in Article 6(4).
Any Member State which has adopted safeguard measures may in that event retain them until the amendments enter into force in its territory.
