Article 8
Resources in the framework of the mid-term review
1.   In order to allocate the amount indicated in point (c) of Article 6(1), by 1 June 2017 the Commission shall take into account the burden of Member States in border management, including search and rescue activities which may arise during border surveillance operations at sea and assessment reports drawn up as part of the Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism, and threat levels at the external borders for the period 2017-2020, as well as factors that affected security at the external borders in 2014-2016. That amount shall be distributed between Member States on the basis of the weighing of the following categories of borders, taking into account paragraph 6 of this Article:
(a)
45 % for external maritime borders;
(b)
38 % for external land borders;
(c)
17 % for airports.
2.   For the external maritime and land borders the calculation of the amount shall be based on the length of sections of the external border multiplied by a threat level (minimum, normal, medium, high) for each border section, as follows:
(a)
coefficient 0,5 for minimum threat;
(b)
coefficient 1 for normal threat;
(c)
coefficient 3 for medium threat;
(d)
coefficient 5 for high threat.
3.   For the airports, the allocation shall be calculated for each Member State as follows:
(a)
50 % on the basis of the number of persons crossing the external borders;
(b)
50 % on the basis of the number of third-country nationals refused entry at the external borders.
4.   In accordance with the Frontex Agency’s risk analysis report and in consultation with the Frontex Agency, and, where relevant, other Union agencies, the Commission shall determine threat levels for each external border section of the Member States for the period 2017-2020. The threat levels shall be based on the following factors:
(a)
burden in border management at the external borders;
(b)
factors that affected security at the external borders of the Member States in the period 2014-2016;
(c)
changes in Union policies, for example visa policies;
(d)
possible future trends in migratory flows and risks of unlawful activities related to the irregular crossing of persons of the external borders; and
(e)
likely political, economic and social developments in third countries, and in particular, neighbouring countries.
Before issuing its report determining the threat levels, the Commission shall hold an exchange of views with the Member States.
5.   For the purpose of the distribution of resources under paragraph 1:
(a)
the line between the areas referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 (29), but not the maritime border north of that line, shall be taken into account even though it does not constitute an external land border for as long as Article 1 of Protocol No 10 on Cyprus to the 2003 Act of Accession remains applicable;
(b)
the expression ‘external maritime borders’ shall mean the outer limit of the territorial sea of the Member States as defined in accordance with Articles 4 to 16 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. However, in cases where long range operations are required on a regular basis in order to prevent unauthorised border crossings, that expression shall mean the outer limit of high threat areas. Those outer limits shall be determined by taking into account the relevant data on these operations in 2014-2016 as provided by the Member States in question.
6.   Moreover, following invitation from the Commission by 1 June 2017, Member States may receive an additional allocation, provided that it is earmarked as such in the national programme and is to be used to achieve specific actions to be established in the light of the priorities of the Union at that time.
7.   The additional amounts under this Article shall be allocated to the Member States concerned in an individual financing decision approving or revising their national programme in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014.
