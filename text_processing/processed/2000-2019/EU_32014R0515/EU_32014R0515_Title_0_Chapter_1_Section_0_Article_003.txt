1.   The general objective of the Instrument shall be to contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the Union while facilitating legitimate travel, through a uniform and high level of control of the external borders and the effective processing of Schengen visas, in compliance with the Union’s commitment to fundamental freedoms and human rights.
2.   Within the general objective set out in paragraph 1, the Instrument shall contribute — in accordance with the priorities identified in relevant Union strategies, programmes, threat assessments and risk assessments — to meeting the following specific objectives:
(a)
supporting a common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel, provide a high quality of service to visa applicants, ensure equal treatment of third-country nationals and tackle illegal immigration;
(b)
supporting integrated border management, including promoting further harmonisation of border management-related measures in accordance with common Union standards and through the sharing of information between Member States and between Member States and the Frontex Agency, to ensure, on one hand, a uniform and high level of control and protection of the external borders, including by the tackling of illegal immigration and, on the other hand, the smooth crossing of the external borders in conformity with the Schengen acquis, while guaranteeing access to international protection for those needing it, in accordance with the obligations contracted by the Member States in the field of human rights, including the principle of non-refoulement.
The achievement of the specific objectives of the Instrument shall be evaluated in accordance with Article 55(2) of Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 using common indicators, as set out in Annex IV to this Regulation and programme-specific indicators included in national programmes.

(b)
gradually establishing an integrated management system for external borders, based on solidarity and responsibility, in particular by means of:
(i)
the reinforcement of external border checks and surveillance systems and of inter-agency cooperation between border guards, customs, migration, asylum and law enforcement authorities of Member States at the external borders, including in the maritime border area;
