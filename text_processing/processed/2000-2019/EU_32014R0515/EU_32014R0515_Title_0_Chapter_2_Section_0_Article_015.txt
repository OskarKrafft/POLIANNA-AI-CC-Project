Article 15
Establishing a programme on the development of IT systems
The programme on the development of the IT systems, based on existing and/or new IT systems, shall be implemented subject to adoption of the Union legislative acts defining those IT systems and their communication infrastructure with the aim, in particular, of improving the management and control of travel flows at the external borders by reinforcing checks while speeding up border crossings for regular travellers. Where appropriate, synergies with existing IT systems shall be sought in order to avoid double-spending.
The breakdown of the amount referred to in point (b) of Article 5(5) shall be made either in the relevant Union legislative acts or, following the adoption of those legislative acts, through a delegated act in accordance with Article 17.
The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of progress in developing those IT systems at least once a year and whenever appropriate.
