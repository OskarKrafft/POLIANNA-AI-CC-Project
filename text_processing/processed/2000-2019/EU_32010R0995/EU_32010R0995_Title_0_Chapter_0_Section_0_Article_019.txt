Article 19
Penalties
1.   The Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.
2.   The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and may include, inter alia:
(a)
fines proportionate to the environmental damage, the value of the timber or timber products concerned and the tax losses and economic detriment resulting from the infringement, calculating the level of such fines in such way as to make sure that they effectively deprive those responsible of the economic benefits derived from their serious infringements, without prejudice to the legitimate right to exercise a profession, and gradually increasing the level of such fines for repeated serious infringements;
(b)
seizure of the timber and timber products concerned;
(c)
immediate suspension of authorisation to trade.
3.   The Member States shall notify those provisions to the Commission and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendments affecting them.
