Article 9
1. Five years after the entry into force of this Directive, i.e. during a second phase, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuits shall be in accordance with Annex IV, in particular in connection with Article 2.
2. By 31 December 2005, the Commission shall forward an assessment to the European Parliament and the Council of the results obtained as compared with those expected. With a view to achieving a third phase in energy efficiency improvement, the Commission shall then, in consultation with the interested parties, present proposals, if appropriate, regarding further improvement in energy efficiency of ballasts. The maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuits and the date of its entry into force shall be based on levels which can be economically and technically justified in the light of the circumstances at the time. Any other measure judged appropriate to improve the inherent energy efficiency of ballasts and to encourage the use of energy-saving lighting controls systems should be considered.
