Article 2
1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that, during a first phase, ballasts may be placed on the market, either as a single component or incorporated in luminaires, only if the power consumption of the ballast in question is less than, or equal to, the maximum input power of ballast-lamp circuits as defined in Annexes I, II and III for each ballast category.
2. The manufacturer of a ballast, its or his authorised representative established in the Community or the person responsible for placing the ballast, either as a single component or incorporated in luminaires, on the market shall be responsible for ensuring that each ballast placed on the market, either as a single component or incorporated in luminaires, conforms with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1.
