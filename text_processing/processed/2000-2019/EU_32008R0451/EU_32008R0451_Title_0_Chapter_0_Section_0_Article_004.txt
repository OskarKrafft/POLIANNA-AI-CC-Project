Article 4
National classifications of products by economic activity
1.   Member States may use the CPA for aggregated or detailed, national, specific or functional adaptation based on the subcategories of the CPA.
2.   Those classifications shall be related to the CPA in accordance with the following rules:
(a)
classifications that are more aggregated than the CPA shall comprise precise aggregations of CPA subcategories;
(b)
classifications that are more detailed than the CPA shall comprise headings that are wholly contained within CPA subcategories.
The classifications that are derived in accordance with this paragraph may have a different coding.
3.   Member States may use a national classification of products by economic activity derived from the CPA. In such a case, they shall forward to the Commission drafts defining their national classification. Within three months after receiving such a draft, the Commission shall verify the conformity of the envisaged national classification with paragraph 2 and shall transmit it to the other Member States for information. The Member States’ national classifications shall include a table of correspondence with the CPA.
