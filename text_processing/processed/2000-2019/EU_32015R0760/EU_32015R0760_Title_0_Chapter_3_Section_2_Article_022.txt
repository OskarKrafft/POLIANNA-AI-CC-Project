proceeds that the assets are regularly producing;
(b)
capital appreciation realised after the disposal of an asset.
2.   The proceeds shall not be distributed to the extent that they are required for future commitments of the ELTIF.

4.   The rules or instruments of incorporation of an ELTIF shall specify the distribution policy that the ELTIF will apply during its life.
