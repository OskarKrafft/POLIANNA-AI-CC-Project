Article 21
Designation of authorities
1.   Member States participating in a cooperation programme shall designate, for the purposes of Article 123(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a single managing authority; for the purposes of Article 123(2) of that Regulation, a single certifying authority; and, for the purposes of Article 123(4) of that Regulation, a single audit authority.

3.   The procedure for the designation of the managing authority and, where appropriate, of the certifying authority, set out in Article 124 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, shall be carried out by the Member State in which the authority is located.
