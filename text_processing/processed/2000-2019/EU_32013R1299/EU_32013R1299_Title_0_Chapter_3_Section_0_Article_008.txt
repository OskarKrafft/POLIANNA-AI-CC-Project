Article 8
Content, adoption and amendment of cooperation programmes

Without prejudice to Article 59 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, a priority axis shall correspond to a thematic objective and comprise one or more of the investment priorities of that thematic objective in line with Articles 6 and 7 of this Regulation. Where appropriate, and in order to increase its impact and effectiveness through a thematically coherent integrated approach to pursuing the objectives of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, a priority axis may, in duly justified cases, combine one or more complementary investment priorities from different thematic objectives in order to achieve the maximum contribution to that priority axis.
2.   A cooperation programme shall contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and to the achievement of economic, social and territorial cohesion, and shall set out:
(a)
a justification for the choice of thematic objectives, corresponding investment priorities and financial allocations, having regard to the Common Strategic Framework set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, based on an analysis of the needs within the programme area as a whole and the strategy chosen in response to such needs, addressing where appropriate missing links in cross-border infrastructure, taking into account the results of the ex-ante evaluation carried out in accordance with Article 55 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013;
(b)
