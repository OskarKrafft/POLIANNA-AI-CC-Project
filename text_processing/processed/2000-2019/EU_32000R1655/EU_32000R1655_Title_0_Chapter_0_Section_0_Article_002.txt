ArticleÂ 2
Thematic components and general criteria
LIFE shall consist of the three thematic components: LIFE-nature, LIFE-environment and LIFE-third countries.
The projects financed by LIFE shall meet the following general criteria:
(a)
be of Community interest by making a significant contribution to the general objective laid down in Article 1;
(b)
be carried out by technically and financially sound participants;
(c)
be feasible in terms of technical proposals, timetable, budget and value for money.
Priority may be given to projects based on a multinational approach when this is likely to have more effective results in terms of achievement of objectives taking into account feasibility and costs.
