Article 18
Power of the competent authority in relation to operations on installations
Member States shall ensure that the competent authority:
(a)
prohibits the operation or commencement of operations on any installation or any connected infrastructure where the measures proposed in the report on major hazards for the prevention or limiting the consequences of major accidents or notifications of well operations or combined operations submitted pursuant to points (h) or (i) of Article 11(1) respectively are considered insufficient to fulfil the requirements set out in this Directive;
(b)
in exceptional situations and where it considers that safety and environmental protection are not compromised, shortens the time interval required between the submission of the report on major hazards or other documents to be submitted pursuant to Article 11 and the commencement of operations;
(c)
requires the operator to take such proportionate measures as the competent authority considers necessary to ensure compliance with Article 3(1);
(d)
where Article 6(4) applies, takes adequate measures to ensure the continuing safety of operations;
(e)
is empowered to require improvements and, if necessary, prohibit the continued operation of any installation or any part thereof or any connected infrastructure where it is shown by the outcome of an inspection, a determination pursuant to Article 6(4), a periodic review of the report on major hazards submitted pursuant to point (e) of Article 11(1) or by changes to notifications submitted pursuant to Article 11, that the requirements of this Directive are not being fulfilled or there are reasonable concerns about the safety of offshore oil and gas operations or installations.
