Article 14
Internal emergency response plans
1.   Member States shall ensure that operators or owners, as appropriate, prepare internal emergency response plans to be submitted pursuant to point (g) of Article 11(1). The plans shall be prepared in accordance with Article 28 taking into account the major accident risk assessment undertaken during preparation of the most recent report on major hazards. The plan shall include an analysis of the oil spill response effectiveness.
2.   In the event that a mobile non-production installation is to be used for carrying out well operations, the internal emergency response plan for the installation shall take into account the risk assessment undertaken during the preparation of the notification of well operations to be submitted pursuant to point (h) of Article 11(1). Where the internal emergency response plan has to be amended due to the particular nature or location of the well, Member States shall ensure that the operator of the well submits the amended internal emergency response plan, or an adequate description thereof, to the competent authority to complement the relevant notification of well operations.
3.   In the event that a non-production installation is to be used for carrying out combined operations, the internal emergency response plan shall be amended to cover the combined operations and shall be submitted to the competent authority to complement the relevant notification of the combined operations.
