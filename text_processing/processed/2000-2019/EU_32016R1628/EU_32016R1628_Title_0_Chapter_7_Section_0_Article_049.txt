Article 49
Assessment of the skills of technical services
1.   The designating approval authority shall draw up an assessment report demonstrating that the candidate technical service has been assessed for its compliance with this Regulation and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to it. The assessment report may include a certificate of accreditation issued by a national accreditation body attesting that the technical service fulfils the requirements of this Regulation.
The assessment on which the assessment report is based shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions laid down in a delegated act referred to in Article 48.
2.   The designating approval authority shall review the assessment report at least once every three years.
3.   The designating approval authority shall communicate the assessment report to the Commission upon the latter's request. In such cases, where the assessment is not based on an accreditation certificate issued by a national accreditation body, the designating approval authority shall provide the Commission with documentary evidence which attests to the following:
(a)
the technical service's competence;
(b)
the arrangements in place to ensure that the technical service is monitored regularly by the designating approval authority; and
(c)
that the technical service fulfils the requirements of this Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted pursuant to it.
4.   An approval authority that intends to act as a technical service in accordance with Article 47(2) shall document compliance by means of an assessment conducted by auditors independent of the activity being assessed. Such auditors may be from the same organisation, provided that they are managed separately from the personnel undertaking the assessed activity.
