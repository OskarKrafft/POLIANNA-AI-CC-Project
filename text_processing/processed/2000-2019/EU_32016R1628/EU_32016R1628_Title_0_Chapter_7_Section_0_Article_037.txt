Article 37
Obligations of manufacturers with regard to production reporting
1.   The manufacturer shall submit to the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval a list containing the number of engines for each engine type and engine sub-category produced in accordance with this Regulation and in conformity with the EU type-approval since the last production report was submitted, or since the requirements of this Regulation first became applicable.
That list shall be submitted:
(a)
within 45 days following the end of each calendar year;
(b)
immediately after each of the dates for the placing on the market of engines referred to in Annex III; and
(c)
by any other date that the approval authority may stipulate.
2.   The list referred to in paragraph 1 shall specify how the identification numbers correlate to the corresponding engine types and, where applicable, engine families and to the EU type-approval numbers where those correlations are not identified by the engine coding system.
3.   The list referred to in paragraph 1 shall indicate clearly any case in which the manufacturer ceases to produce an approved engine type or engine family.
4.   The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the list referred to in paragraph 1 for a minimum period of 20 years following the end of the validity of the EU type-approval concerned.
5.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down the format of the list referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted, by 31 December 2016, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 56(2).
