Article 36
Subsequent adaptation of delegated and implementing acts
1.   Where the Commission authorises the granting of an exemption pursuant to Article 35, it shall immediately take the steps necessary to adapt the delegated or implementing acts concerned to technological developments.
Where the exemption authorised pursuant to Article 35 relates to a matter that is regulated by a UNECE regulation, the Commission shall propose an amendment to that regulation in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Revised 1958 Agreement.
2.   As soon as the relevant delegated or implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 have been amended, the Commission shall lift any restriction imposed by the decision authorising the exemption.
Where the steps necessary to adapt the delegated or implementing acts have not been taken, the Commission may, at the request of the Member State which granted the provisional EU type-approval, authorise that Member State to extend it by means of a decision in the form of an implementing act adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 56(2).
