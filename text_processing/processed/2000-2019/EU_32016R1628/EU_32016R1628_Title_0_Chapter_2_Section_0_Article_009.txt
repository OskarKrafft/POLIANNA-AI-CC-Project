Article 9
Obligations of manufacturers concerning engines that are not in conformity
1.   A manufacturer who has reason to believe or considers that one of its engines placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately conduct an investigation into the nature of the suspected non-conformity and the likely extent of its occurrence.
Based on the outcome of the investigation, the manufacturer shall take corrective measures to ensure that engines in production are brought into conformity with the approved engine type or engine family in a timely manner.
The manufacturer shall immediately inform the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval of the investigation, giving details, in particular, of the non-conformity and of any corrective measures taken.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a manufacturer shall not be required to take corrective measures in respect of an engine which is not in conformity with this Regulation as a result of modifications made after it has been placed on the market and that were not authorised by the manufacturer.
