Article 12
Obligations of importers concerning engines that are not in conformity
1.   An importer that has reason to believe or considers that an engine is not in conformity with this Regulation, and in particular that it does not correspond to its EU type-approval, shall not place the engine on the market until it has been brought into conformity.
The importer shall inform, without undue delay, the manufacturer and the market surveillance authorities, as well as the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval, thereof.
2.   An importer that has reason to believe or considers that an engine which it has placed on the market is not in conformity with this Regulation shall immediately conduct an investigation into the nature of the suspected non-conformity and the likely extent of its occurrence.
Based upon the outcome of the investigation, the importer shall take corrective measures and inform the manufacturer thereof to ensure that engines in production are brought into conformity with the approved engine type or engine family in a timely manner.
