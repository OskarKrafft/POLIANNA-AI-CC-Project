Article 51
Changes to designations
1.   Where a designating approval authority has ascertained or has been informed that a technical service designated by it either no longer fulfils the requirements laid down in this Regulation or is failing to meet its obligations, it shall restrict, suspend or revoke the designation, as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to fulfil those requirements or meet those obligations.
The Member State that has provided the Commission with notification of that technical service in accordance with Article 50(1) shall immediately inform the Commission of any such restriction, suspension or revocation.
The Commission shall modify the published information referred to in Article 50(5) accordingly.
2.   In the event of the restriction, suspension or revocation of the designation referred to in paragraph 1, or where the technical service has ceased its activity, the designating approval authority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of that technical service are either processed by another technical service or kept available for the designating approval authority or for the market surveillance authorities at their request.
