Article 39
Engines not in conformity with the approved type
1.   Where engines bearing a statutory marking and, where applicable, accompanied by a statement of conformity are not in conformity with the approved engine type or engine family, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the engines in production are brought into conformity with the approved engine type or engine family. Such measures may include the withdrawal of the EU type-approval if the remedial action taken by the manufacturer is inadequate.
The relevant approval authority shall inform the approval authorities of the other Member States of the measures taken.
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, deviations from the particulars set out in the EU type-approval certificate or in the information package, where those deviations have not been authorised in accordance with Chapter VI, shall be deemed to constitute a failure to conform to the approved engine type or engine family.
3.   Where an approval authority finds that engines accompanied by a statement of conformity, if applicable, or bearing a type-approval mark issued in another Member State are not in conformity with the approved engine type or engine family, it may request that the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval verify that the engines in production continue to conform to the approved engine type or engine family. On receipt of such a request, the approval authority which granted the EU type-approval shall take the action referred to in paragraph 1 as soon as possible, and at the latest within three months of the date of the request.
4.   The approval authorities shall inform each other within one month of any EU type-approval having been withdrawn and of the reasons for that withdrawal, in accordance with Article 22(5).
5.   Where the approval authority that granted the EU type-approval disputes the non-conformity of which it is notified, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute.
The approval authority shall keep the Commission informed thereof and, where necessary, the Commission shall hold appropriate consultations with a view to reaching a settlement.
