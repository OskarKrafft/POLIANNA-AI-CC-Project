(2)   ‘category NRG’: engines having a reference power that is greater than 560 kW, exclusively for use in generating sets; engines for generating sets other than those having those characteristics are included in the categories NRE or NRS, according to their characteristics;
(3)   ‘category NRSh’: hand-held SI engines having a reference power that is less than 19 kW, exclusively for use in hand-held machinery;
(4)   ‘category NRS’: SI engines having a reference power that is less than 56 kW and not included in category NRSh;
(5)   ‘category IWP’: 
(a)
engines exclusively for use in inland waterway vessels, for their direct or indirect propulsion, or intended for their direct or indirect propulsion, having a reference power that is greater than or equal to 19 kW;
(b)
engines used in place of engines of category IWA provided that they comply with Article 24(8);
(6)   ‘category IWA’: auxiliary engines exclusively for use in inland waterway vessels and having a reference power that is greater than or equal to 19 kW;
(7)   ‘category RLL’: engines exclusively for use in locomotives, for their propulsion or intended for their propulsion;
(8)   ‘category RLR’: 
(a)
engines exclusively for use in railcars, for their propulsion or intended for their propulsion;
(b)
engines used in the place of Stage V engines of category RLL;
(9)   ‘category SMB’: SI engines exclusively for use in snowmobiles; engines for snowmobiles other than SI engines are included in the category NRE;
(10)   ‘category ATS’: SI engines exclusively for use in ATVs and SbS; engines for ATVs and SbS other than SI engines are included in the category NRE.
2.   A variable-speed engine of a particular category may be used in the place of a constant-speed engine of the same category.
Variable-speed engines of category IWP used for constant-speed operation shall additionally comply with Article 24(7) or Article 24(8), as applicable.
