Article 38
Verification measures
1.   The approval authority of a Member State that granted an EU type-approval shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, where appropriate in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, the identification numbers relating to the EU type-approval are correctly allocated to, and are properly used by, manufacturers before the type-approved engine is placed or made available on the market.
2.   An additional verification of the identification numbers may be carried out in conjunction with the control of conformity of production laid down in Article 26.
3.   With regard to the verification of the identification numbers, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's representative shall, upon request, provide without delay to the responsible approval authority the information required concerning the manufacturer's purchasers, together with the identification numbers of the engines reported as produced in accordance with Article 37. Where engines are made available to an OEM, no additional information shall be required of the manufacturer.
4.   If, further to a request from the approval authority, the manufacturer is unable to demonstrate compliance with the statutory marking requirements, the approval authority may withdraw the EU type-approval granted in respect of the corresponding engine type or engine family. The approval authorities shall inform each other within one month of any EU type-approval having been withdrawn and of the reasons for that withdrawal, in accordance with Article 22(5).
