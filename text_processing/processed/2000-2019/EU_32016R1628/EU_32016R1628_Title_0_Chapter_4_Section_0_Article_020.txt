Article 20
Application for EU type-approval
1.   Manufacturers shall submit a separate application for each engine type or engine family EU type-approval to the approval authority of a Member State, and each application shall be accompanied by the information folder referred to in Article 21. Only one application shall be submitted in respect of a particular engine type or, where applicable, engine family, and it shall be submitted to only one approval authority.
2.   Manufacturers shall make available to the technical service responsible for conducting the EU type-approval tests an engine conforming to the engine type or, in the case of an engine family, to the parent engine characteristics described in the information folder referred to in Article 21.
3.   In the case of an application for EU type-approval of an engine family, if the approval authority determines that, with regard to the selected parent engine referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the application submitted does not fully represent the engine family described in the information folder referred to in Article 21, manufacturers shall make available an alternative and, if necessary, an additional parent engine which is considered by the approval authority to represent the engine family.
4.   Within one month of the start of production of the approved engine type or engine family, manufacturers shall submit the initial plan for monitoring in-service engines to the approval authority that granted EU type-approval for that engine type or, where applicable, engine family.
