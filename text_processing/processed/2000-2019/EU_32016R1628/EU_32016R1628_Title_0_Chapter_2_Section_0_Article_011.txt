3.   For a period of ten years following the placing on the market of the engine, importers shall keep, where applicable, a copy of the statement of conformity referred to in Article 31 at the disposal of the approval and market surveillance authorities, and shall ensure that the EU type-approval certificate with its attachments as referred to in Article 23(1) can be made available to those authorities, upon request.
4.   Importers shall indicate, on the engine or, where that is not possible, in a document accompanying the engine, their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the address at which they can be contacted.
5.   Importers shall ensure that the engine is accompanied by the information and instructions referred to in Article 43.

That information and documentation shall be in a language which can be easily understood by the requesting national authority.
