Article 51
Customised link access
1.   Where a CSD requests another CSD to establish a customised link for having access to the latter, the receiving CSD shall reject such a request only on the basis of risk considerations. It shall not deny a request on the grounds of loss of market share.
2.   The receiving CSD may charge a reasonable commercial fee on a cost-plus basis to the requesting CSD for making customised link access available, unless otherwise agreed by both parties.
