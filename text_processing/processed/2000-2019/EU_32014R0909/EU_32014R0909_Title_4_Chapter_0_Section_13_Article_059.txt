where prearranged funding arrangements are used, it shall select only creditworthy financial institutions as liquidity providers; it shall establish and apply appropriate concentration limits for each of the corresponding liquidity providers including its parent undertaking and subsidiaries;

Such draft regulatory technical standards shall, where appropriate, be aligned to the regulatory technical standards adopted in accordance with Article 46(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
