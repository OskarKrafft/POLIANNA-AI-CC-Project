(b)
has obtained the authorisation by making false statements or by any other unlawful means;
(c)
no longer complies with the conditions under which authorisation was granted and has not taken the remedial actions requested by the competent authority within a set time-frame;

has seriously or systematically infringed the requirements laid down in this Regulation or, where applicable, in Directive 2014/65/EU or Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.

3.   ESMA and any relevant authority and, where applicable, the authority referred to in Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU may, at any time, request that the competent authority of the home Member State examines whether the CSD still complies with the conditions under which the authorisation was granted.
4.   The competent authority may limit the withdrawal of authorisation to a particular service, activity, or financial instrument.
5.   A CSD shall establish, implement and maintain adequate procedures ensuring the timely and orderly settlement and transfer of the assets of clients and participants to another CSD in the event of a withdrawal of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1.
