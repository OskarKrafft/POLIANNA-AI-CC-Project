Article 75
Review
By 18 September 2019, the Commission shall review and prepare a general report on this Regulation. That report shall, in particular, assess the matters referred to in points (a) to (k) of Article 74(1), whether there are other substantive barriers to competition in relation to the services subject to this Regulation which are insufficiently addressed and the potential need for further measures to limit the impact on taxpayers of the failure of CSDs. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate proposals.
