Article 28
User committee
1.   A CSD shall establish user committees for each securities settlement system it operates, which shall be composed of representatives of issuers and of participants in such securities settlement systems. The advice of the user committee shall be independent from any direct influence by the management of the CSD.
2.   A CSD shall define in a non-discriminatory way the mandate for each established user committee, the governance arrangements necessary to ensure its independence and its operational procedures, as well as the admission criteria and the election mechanism for user committee members. The governance arrangements shall be publicly available and shall ensure that the user committee reports directly to the management body and holds regular meetings.
3.   User committees shall advise the management body on key arrangements that impact on their members, including the criteria for accepting issuers or participants in their respective securities settlement systems and on service level.
4.   User committees may submit a non-binding opinion to the management body containing detailed reasons regarding the pricing structures of the CSD.
5.   Without prejudice to the right of competent authorities to be duly informed, the members of the user committees shall be bound by confidentiality. Where the chairman of a user committee determines that a member has an actual or a potential conflict of interest in relation to a particular matter, that member shall not be allowed to vote on that matter.
6.   A CSD shall promptly inform the competent authority and the user committee of any decision in which the management body decides not to follow the advice of the user committee. The user committee may inform the competent authority of any areas in which it considers that the advice of the user committee has not been followed.
