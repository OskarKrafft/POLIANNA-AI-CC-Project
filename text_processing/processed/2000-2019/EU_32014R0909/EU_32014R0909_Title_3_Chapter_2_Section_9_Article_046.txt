Article 46
Investment policy
1.   A CSD shall hold its financial assets at central banks, authorised credit institutions or authorised CSDs.
2.   A CSD shall have prompt access to its assets, where required.
3.   A CSD shall invest its financial resources only in cash or in highly liquid financial instruments with minimal market and credit risk. Those investments shall be capable of being liquidated rapidly with minimal adverse price effect.
4.   The amount of capital, including retained earnings and reserves of a CSD which are not invested in accordance with paragraph 3 shall not be taken into account for the purposes of Article 47(1).
5.   A CSD shall ensure that its overall risk exposure to any individual authorised credit institution or authorised CSD with which it holds its financial assets remains within acceptable concentration limits.
6.   ESMA shall, in close cooperation with EBA and the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the financial instruments that can be considered to be highly liquid with minimal market and credit risk as referred to in paragraph 3, the appropriate timeframe for access to assets referred to in paragraph 2 and the concentration limits as referred to in paragraph 5. Such draft regulatory technical standards shall, where appropriate, be aligned to the regulatory technical standards adopted in accordance with Article 47(8) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
