Article 47
Capital requirements
1.   Capital, together with retained earnings and reserves of a CSD, shall be proportional to the risks stemming from the activities of the CSD. It shall be at all times sufficient to:
(a)
ensure that the CSD is adequately protected against operational, legal, custody, investment and business risks so that the CSD can continue to provide services as a going concern;
(b)
ensure an orderly winding-down or restructuring of the CSD’s activities over an appropriate time span of at least six months under a range of stress scenarios.
2.   A CSD shall maintain a plan for the following:
(a)
the raising of additional capital should its equity capital approach or fall below the requirements laid down in paragraph 1;
(b)
ensuring the orderly winding-down or restructuring of its operations and services where the CSD is unable to raise new capital.
The plan shall be approved by the management body or an appropriate committee of the management body and updated regularly. Each update of the plan shall be provided to the competent authority. The competent authority may require the CSD to take additional measures or to make any alternative provision where the competent authority considers that the CSD’s plan is insufficient.
3.   EBA shall, in close cooperation with ESMA and the members of the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying requirements regarding the capital, retained earnings and reserves of a CSD referred to in paragraph 1.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 18 June 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
