Article 4
1. The activities to be carried out under this Regulation shall address in particular:
(a) development of appropriate national and international forest policy frameworks based on realistic valuation of forests, which include land use planning, equitable trade in sustainably produced forest products, legal and fiscal measures, institution building, support to the private sector and support to self-development of forest-dependent people to shape their own social, economic and cultural development. These shall take into account other sectoral policies which have an impact on forests and the interests and customary rights of forest-dependent people;
(b) conservation and restoration of forests which are considered to be of importance due to their high ecological value, in particular their value for the preservation of biodiversity, or due to their local and global impacts, such as the protection of hydrographic basins, the prevention of soil erosion, or of climate change;
(c) sustainable forest management and utilisation to provide economic, social and environmental benefits and including, inter alia, forest certification - taking account of the different management conditions for small and large forest areas - and environmentally sound harvesting of both wood and non-wood forest products and natural and assisted forest regeneration;
(d) economic viability of sustainable forest management through more efficient utilisation of forest products and technical improvements of downstream activities related to the forest sector such as small and medium scale processing and marketing of wood and nonwood forest products, the sustainable use of wood as an energy source and the promotion of alternatives to agricultural practices based on forest clearing;
(e) knowledge and information generation and management concerning forest services and products, in order to provide a sound scientific basis for the activities listed under (a) to (d).
2. Activities eligible for financing shall include pilot projects in the field, innovative programmes, studies and research, the results of which will, in addition to their specific objectives, contribute to the development, adjustment and better implementation of forestry policies of the Community and of partner countries.
3. Particular attention shall be given to:
- encouraging environmentally and socially responsible private entrepreneurship in the forest products processing and marketing chain, in the context of agreed policies for private sector development and taking into account existing social systems and community-based economic activities;
- encouraging the direct participation of cooperation partners in the developing countries, and at the same time ensuring an appropriate scale of interventions and adaptation of administrative procedures to local management capacity;
- providing prior information and ensuring the participation of forest-dependent people and local communities in activities carried out under this Regulation, taking into account their development priorities and economic, social and cultural rights, inter alia, through capacity building, in order to ensure their full participation in all decision-making processes;
- the sustainability of any proposed activity, social, economic as well as environmental;
- proper coordination and information flows between the Commission and the Member States in order to ensure coherence of activities in the regions concerned;
- gender-specific roles, knowledge, perspectives and contributions of women/girls and men/boys in the management and use of forests.
4. Priorities shall be determined in accordance with:
- the needs of each country as reflected in regional and national development and environment policies relating to forests, considering national forest plans and local needs, and
- Community cooperation objectives as established by the Commission in jointly agreed country strategy papers.
5. Activities carried out under this Regulation shall be preceded by environmental and socio-cultural impact assessments, including an assessment of the congruence of the envisaged operations with the development priorities of the forest-dependent people and local communities concerned, as well as analysis of financial and economic feasibility. These activities shall also be preceded by a transparent exchange of information with forest-dependent people and local communities and be conditional on their support.
6. Activities carried out under this Regulation shall be coordinated with, and may provide support for, national and international programmes and activities on the conservation and sustainable management of forests, in particular the proposals for action formulated by the Intergovernmental Panel for Forests/Intergovernmental Forum for Forests (IPF/IFF) process.
7. When appropriate, activities shall be carried out within the framework of regional organisations and international programmes of cooperation and shall be supportive to the development of a global policy on the conservation and sustainable management of forests in which Community policy can be integrated.
