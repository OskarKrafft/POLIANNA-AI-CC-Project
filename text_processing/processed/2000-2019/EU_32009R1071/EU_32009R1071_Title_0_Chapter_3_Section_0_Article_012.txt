Article 12
Checks
1.   Competent authorities shall monitor whether undertakings which they have authorised to engage in the occupation of road transport operator continue to fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 3. To that end, Member States shall carry out checks targeting those undertakings which are classed as posing an increased risk. For that purpose, Member States shall extend the risk classification system established by them pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities (10) to cover all infringements specified in Article 6 of this Regulation.
2.   Until 31 December 2014, Member States shall carry out checks at least every 5 years to verify that undertakings fulfil the requirements laid down in Article 3.
Measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and relating to a postponement of the date referred to in the first subparagraph shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3).
3.   Member States shall carry out individual checks to verify whether an undertaking meets the conditions governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator whenever the Commission so requests in duly motivated cases. It shall inform the Commission of the results of such checks and of the measures taken if it is established that the undertaking no longer fulfils the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
