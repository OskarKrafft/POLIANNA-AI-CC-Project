Article 15
Decisions of the competent authorities and appeals
1.   Negative decisions taken by the competent authorities of the Member States pursuant to this Regulation, including the rejection of an application, the suspension or withdrawal of an existing authorisation and a declaration of unfitness of a transport manager, shall state the reasons on which they are based.
Such decisions shall take account of available information concerning infringements committed by the undertaking or the transport manager which are such as to detract from the good repute of the undertaking and of any other information at the disposal of the competent authority. They shall specify the rehabilitation measures applicable in the event of the suspension of an authorisation or a declaration of unfitness.
2.   Member States shall take steps to ensure that the undertakings and persons concerned have the possibility of appealing the decisions referred to in paragraph 1 to at least one independent and impartial body or a court of law.
