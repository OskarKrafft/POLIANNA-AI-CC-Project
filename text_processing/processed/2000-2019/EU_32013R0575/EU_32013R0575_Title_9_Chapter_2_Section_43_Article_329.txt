Article 329
Options and warrants
1.   Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.
2.   Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks, apart from the delta risk, associated with options in the own funds requirements.
3.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, referred to in paragraph 2 in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options and warrants.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
4.   Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in paragraph 3, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.
