Article 302
Monitoring of exposures to CCPs
1.   Institutions shall monitor all their exposures to CCPs and shall lay down procedures for the regular reporting of information on those exposures to senior management and appropriate committee or committees of the management body.
2.   Institutions shall assess, through appropriate scenario analysis and stress testing, whether the level of own funds held against exposures to a CCP, including potential future credit exposures, exposures from default fund contributions and, where the institution is acting as a clearing member, exposures resulting from contractual arrangements as laid down in Article 304, adequately relates to the inherent risks of those exposures.
