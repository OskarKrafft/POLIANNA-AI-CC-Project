Article 350
Specific methods for CIUs
1.   Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk. Under such an approach, positions in CIUs shall be treated as positions in the underlying investments of the CIU. Netting shall be permitted between positions in the underlying investments of the CIU and other positions held by the institution, provided that the institution holds a sufficient quantity of shares or units to allow for redemption/creation in exchange for the underlying investments.
2.   Institutions may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, for positions in CIUs by assuming positions representing those necessary to replicate the composition and performance of the externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities referred to in point (a), subject to the following conditions:
(a)
the purpose of the CIU's mandate is to replicate the composition and performance of an externally generated index or fixed basket of equities or debt securities;
(b)
a minimum correlation coefficient between daily returns on the CIU and the index or basket of equities or debt securities it tracks of 0,9 can be clearly established over a minimum period of six months.
3.   Where the institution is not aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for position risk, comprising specific and general risk, subject to the following conditions:
(a)
it will be assumed that the CIU first invests to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate in the asset classes attracting the highest own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, and then continues making investments in descending order until the maximum total investment limit is reached. The position in the CIU will be treated as a direct holding in the assumed position;
(b)
institutions shall take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for specific and general risk separately, by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the mandate;
(c)
if the own funds requirement for specific and general risk together in accordance with this paragraph exceed that set out in Article 348(1) the own funds requirement shall be capped at that level.
4.   Institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report own funds requirements for position risk for positions in CIUs falling under paragraphs 1 to 4, in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter:
(a)
the depository of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository;
(b)
for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).
The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.
Article 351
De minimis and weighting for foreign exchange risk
If the sum of an institution's overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position, calculated in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 352, including for any foreign exchange and gold positions for which own funds requirements are calculated using an internal model, exceeds 2 % of its total own funds, the institution shall calculate an own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. The own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk shall be the sum of its overall net foreign-exchange position and its net gold position in the reporting currency, multiplied by 8 %.
Article 352
Calculation of the overall net foreign exchange position
1.   The institution's net open position in each currency (including the reporting currency) and in gold shall be calculated as the sum of the following elements (positive or negative):
(a)
the net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, in the currency in question or, for gold, the net spot position in gold);
(b)
the net forward position, which are all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward exchange and gold transactions, including currency and gold futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position;
(c)
irrevocable guarantees and similar instruments that are certain to be called and likely to be irrecoverable;
(d)
the net delta, or delta-based, equivalent of the total book of foreign-currency and gold options;
(e)
the market value of other options.
The delta used for purposes of point (d) shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.
The institution may include net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged if it does so consistently.
The institution may break down net positions in composite currencies into the component currencies according to the quotas in force.
2.   Any positions which an institution has deliberately taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on its ratios in accordance with Article 92(1) may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, be excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions. Such positions shall be of a non-trading or structural nature and any variation of the terms of their exclusion, subject to separate permission by the competent authorities. The same treatment subject to the same conditions may be applied to positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds.
3.   An institution may use the net present value when calculating the net open position in each currency and in gold provided that the institution applies this approach consistently.
4.   Net short and long positions in each currency other than the reporting currency and the net long or short position in gold shall be converted at spot rates into the reporting currency. They shall then be summed separately to form the total of the net short positions and the total of the net long positions respectively. The higher of these two totals shall be the institution's overall net foreign-exchange position.
5.   Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements.
6.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.
Article 353
Foreign exchange risk of CIUs
1.   For the purposes of Article 352, in respect of CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account.
2.   Institutions may rely on the following third parties' reporting of the foreign exchange positions in the CIU:
(a)
the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;
(b)
for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of Article 132(3).
The correctness of the calculation shall be confirmed by an external auditor.
3.   Where an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions in a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU is invested up to the maximum extent allowed under the CIU's mandate in foreign exchange and institutions shall, for trading book positions, take account of the maximum indirect exposure that they could achieve by taking leveraged positions through the CIU when calculating their own funds requirement for foreign exchange risk. This shall be done by proportionally increasing the position in the CIU up to the maximum exposure to the underlying investment items resulting from the investment mandate. The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the addition of the total long position to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position to the total short open foreign exchange position where the direction of the CIU's investment is available. There shall be no netting allowed between such positions prior to the calculation.
Article 354
Closely correlated currencies
1.   Institutions may provide lower own funds requirements against positions in relevant closely correlated currencies. A pair of currencies is deemed to be closely correlated only if the likelihood of a loss — calculated on the basis of daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years — occurring on equal and opposite positions in such currencies over the following 10 working days, which is 4 % or less of the value of the matched position in question (valued in terms of the reporting currency) has a probability of at least 99 %, when an observation period of three years is used, and 95 %, when an observation period of five years is used. The own-funds requirement on the matched position in two closely correlated currencies shall be 4 % multiplied by the value of the matched position.
2.   In calculating the requirements of this Chapter, institutions may disregard positions in currencies, which are subject to a legally binding intergovernmental agreement to limit its variation relative to other currencies covered by the same agreement. Institutions shall calculate their matched positions in such currencies and subject them to an own funds requirement no lower than half of the maximum permissible variation laid down in the intergovernmental agreement in question in respect of the currencies concerned.
3.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies for which the treatment set out in paragraph 1 is available.
EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
4.   The own funds requirement on the matched positions in currencies of Member States participating in the second stage of the economic and monetary union may be calculated as 1,6 % of the value of such matched positions.
5.   Only the unmatched positions in currencies referred to in this Article shall be incorporated into the overall net open position in accordance with Article 352(4).
6.   Where daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three or five years - occurring on equal and opposite positions in a pair of currencies over the following 10 working days show that these two currencies are perfectly positively correlated and the institution always can face a zero bid/ask spread on the respective trades, the institution can, upon explicit permission by its competent authority, apply an own funds requirement of 0 % until the end of 2017.
Article 355
Choice of method for commodities risk
Subject to Articles 356 to 358, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for commodities risk with one of the methods set out in Article 359, 360 or 361.
Article 356
Ancillary commodities business
1.   Institutions with ancillary agricultural commodities business may determine the own funds requirements for their physical commodity stock at the end of each year for the following year where all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
at any time of the year it holds own funds for this risk which are not lower than the average own funds requirement for that risk estimated on a conservative basis for the coming year;
(b)
it estimates on a conservative basis the expected volatility for the figure calculated under point (a);
(c)
its average own funds requirement for this risk does not exceed 5 % of its own funds or EUR 1 million and, taking into account the volatility estimated in accordance with (b), the expected peak own funds requirements do not exceed 6,5 % of its own funds;
(d)
the institution monitors on an ongoing basis whether the estimates carried out under points (a) and (b) still reflect the reality.
2.   Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities the use they make of the option provided in paragraph 1.
Article 357
Positions in commodities
1.   Each position in commodities or commodity derivatives shall be expressed in terms of the standard unit of measurement. The spot price in each commodity shall be expressed in the reporting currency.
2.   Positions in gold or gold derivatives shall be considered as being subject to foreign-exchange risk and treated in accordance with Chapter 3 or 5, as appropriate, for the purpose of calculating commodities risk.
3.   For the purpose of Article 360(1), the excess of an institution's long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. Derivative instruments shall be treated, as laid down in Article 358, as positions in the underlying commodity.
4.   For the purposes of calculating a position in a commodity, the following positions shall be treated as positions in the same commodity:
(a)
positions in different sub-categories of commodities in cases where the sub-categories are deliverable against each other;
(b)
positions in similar commodities if they are close substitutes and where a minimum correlation of 0,9 between price movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year.
Article 358
Particular instruments
1.   Commodity futures and forward commitments to buy or sell individual commodities shall be incorporated in the measurement system as notional amounts in terms of the standard unit of measurement and assigned a maturity with reference to expiry date.
2.   Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be treated, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with, where relevant, one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity bands in Article 359(1). The positions shall be long positions if the institution is paying a fixed price and receiving a floating price and short positions if the institution is receiving a fixed price and paying a floating price. Commodity swaps where the sides of the transaction are in different commodities are to be reported in the relevant reporting ladder for the maturity ladder approach.
3.   Options and warrants on commodities or on commodity derivatives shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying commodity or commodity derivative. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.
Institutions shall adequately reflect other risks associated with options, apart from the delta risk, in the own funds requirements.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards defining a range of methods to reflect in the own funds requirements other risks, apart from delta risk, in a manner proportionate to the scale and complexity of institutions' activities in options.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2013.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph, competent authorities may continue to apply the existing national treatments, where the competent authorities have applied those treatments before 31 December 2013.
5.   Where an institution is either of the following, it shall include the commodities concerned in the calculation of its own funds requirement for commodities risk:
(a)
the transferor of commodities or guaranteed rights relating to title to commodities in a repurchase agreement;
(b)
the lender of commodities in a commodities lending agreement.
Article 359
Maturity ladder approach
1.   The institution shall use a separate maturity ladder in line with Table 1 for each commodity. All positions in that commodity shall be assigned to the appropriate maturity bands. Physical stocks shall be assigned to the first maturity band between 0 and up to and including 1 month.

Table 1

1,50 
> 2 ≤ 3 years
1,50 
> 3 years
1,50 
2.   Positions in the same commodity may be offset and assigned to the appropriate maturity bands on a net basis for the following:
(a)
positions in contracts maturing on the same date;
(b)
positions in contracts maturing within 10 days of each other if the contracts are traded on markets which have daily delivery dates.
3.   The institution shall then calculate the sum of the long positions and the sum of the short positions in each maturity band. The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched positions in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched position for the same band.
4.   That part of the unmatched long position for a given maturity band that is matched by the unmatched short position, or vice versa, for a maturity band further out shall be the matched position between two maturity bands. That part of the unmatched long or unmatched short position that cannot be thus matched shall be the unmatched position.
5.   The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant maturity ladder as the sum of the following:
(a)
the sum of the matched long and short positions, multiplied by the appropriate spread rate as indicated in the second column of Table 1 for each maturity band and by the spot price for the commodity;
(b)
the matched position between two maturity bands for each maturity band into which an unmatched position is carried forward, multiplied by 0,6 %, which is the carry rate and by the spot price for the commodity;
(c)
the residual unmatched positions, multiplied by 15 % which is the outright rate and by the spot price for the commodity.
6.   The institution's overall own funds requirement for commodities risk shall be calculated as the sum of the own funds requirements calculated for each commodity in accordance with paragraph 5.
Article 360
Simplified approach
1.   The institution's own funds requirement for each commodity shall be calculated as the sum of the following:
(a)
15 % of the net position, long or short, multiplied by the spot price for the commodity;
(b)
3 % of the gross position, long plus short, multiplied by the spot price for the commodity.
2.   The institution's overall own funds requirement for commodities risk shall be calculated as the sum of the own funds requirements calculated for each commodity in accordance with paragraph 1.
Article 361
Extended maturity ladder approach
Institutions may use the minimum spread, carry and outright rates set out in the following table 2 instead of those indicated in Article 359 provided that the institutions:
(a)
undertake significant commodities business;
(b)
have an appropriately diversified commodities portfolio;
(c)
are not yet in a position to use internal models for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirement for commodities risk.

Institutions shall notify the use they make of this Article to their competent authorities together with evidence of their efforts to implement an internal model for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirement for commodities risk.
Article 362
Specific and general risks
Position risk on a traded debt instrument or equity instrument or derivative thereof may be divided into two components for purposes of this Chapter. The first shall be its specific risk component and shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The general risk component shall encompass the risk of a price change in the instrument due in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative to a change in the level of interest rates or in the case of an equity or equity derivative to a broad equity-market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities.
Article 363
Permission to use internal models
1.   After having verified an institution's compliance with the requirements of Sections 2, 3 and 4 as relevant, competent authorities shall grant permission to institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for one or more of the following risk categories by using their internal models instead of or in combination with the methods in Chapters 2 to 4:
(a)
general risk of equity instruments;
(b)
specific risk of equity instruments;
(c)
general risk of debt instruments;
(d)
specific risk of debt instruments;
(e)
foreign-exchange risk;
(f)
commodities risk.
2.   For risk categories for which the institution has not been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 1 to use its internal models, that institution shall continue to calculate own funds requirements in accordance with those Chapters 2, 3 and 4 as relevant. Permission by the competent authorities for the use of internal models shall be required for each risk category and shall be granted only if the internal model covers a significant share of the positions of a certain risk category.
3.   Material changes to the use of internal models that the institution has received permission to use, the extension of the use of internal models that the institution has received permission to use, in particular to additional risk categories, and the initial calculation of stressed value-at-risk in accordance with Article 365(2) require a separate permission by the competent authority.
Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of all other extensions and changes to the use of those internal models that the institution has received permission to use.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
(a)
the conditions for assessing materiality of extensions and changes to the use of internal models;
(b)
the assessment methodology under which competent authorities permit institutions to use internal models;
(c)
the conditions under which the share of positions covered by the internal model within a risk category shall be considered significant as referred to in paragraph 2.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 364
Own funds requirements when using internal models
1.   Each institution using an internal model shall fulfil, in addition to own funds requirements calculated in accordance with Chapters 2, 3 and 4 for those risk categories for which permission to use an internal model has not been granted, an own funds requirement expressed as the sum of points (a) and (b):
(a)
the higher of the following values:
(i)
its previous day's value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with Article 365(1) (VaRt-1);
(ii)
an average of the daily value-at-risk numbers calculated in accordance with Article 365(1) on each of the preceding sixty business days (VaRavg), multiplied by the multiplication factor (mc) in accordance with Article 366;
(b)
the higher of the following values:
(i)
its latest available stressed-value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with Article 365(2) (sVaRt-1); and
(ii)
an average of the stressed value-at-risk numbers calculated in the manner and frequency specified in Article 365(2) during the preceding sixty business days (sVaRavg), multiplied by the multiplication factor (ms) in accordance with Article 366;
2.   Institutions that use an internal model to calculate their own funds requirement for specific risk of debt instruments shall fulfil an additional own funds requirement expressed as the sum of the following points (a) and (b):
(a)
the own funds requirement calculated in accordance with Article 337 and 338 for the specific risk of securitisation positions and nth to default credit derivatives in the trading book with the exception of those incorporated in an own funds requirement for the specific risk of the correlation trading portfolio in accordance with Section 5 and, where applicable, the own funds requirement for specific risk in accordance with Chapter 2, Section 6, for those positions in CIUs for which neither the conditions in Article 350(1) nor Article 350(2) are fulfilled;
(b)
the higher of:
(i)
the most recent risk number for the incremental default and migration risk calculated in accordance with Section 3;
(ii)
the average of this number over the preceding 12 weeks.
3.   Institutions that have a correlation trading portfolio, which meets the requirements in Article 338(1) to (3), may fulfil an own funds requirement on the basis of Article 377 instead of Article 338(4), calculated as the higher of the following:
(a)
the most recent risk number for the correlation trading portfolio calculated in accordance with Section 5;
(b)
the average of this number over the preceding 12-weeks;
(c)
8 % of the own funds requirement that would, at the time of calculation of the most recent risk number referred to in point (a), be calculated in accordance with Article 338(4) for all those positions incorporated into the internal model for the correlation trading portfolio.
Article 365
VaR and stressed VaR Calculation
1.   The calculation of the value-at-risk number referred to in Article 364 shall be subject to the following requirements:
(a)
daily calculation of the value-at-risk number;
(b)
a 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval;
(c)
a 10-day holding period;
(d)
an effective historical observation period of at least one year except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility;
(e)
at least monthly data set updates.
The institution may use value-at-risk numbers calculated according to shorter holding periods than 10 days scaled up to 10 days by an appropriate methodology that is reviewed periodically.
2.   In addition, the institution shall at least weekly calculate a ‧stressed value-at-risk‧ of the current portfolio, in accordance with the requirements set out in the first paragraph, with value-at-risk model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to the institution's portfolio. The choice of such historical data shall be subject to at least annual review by the institution, which shall notify the outcome to the competent authorities. EBA shall monitor the range of practices for calculating stressed value at risk and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines on such practices.
Article 366
Regulatory back testing and multiplication factors
1.   The results of the calculations referred to in Article 365 shall be scaled up by the multiplication factors (mc) and (ms).
2.   Each of the multiplication factors (mc) and (ms) shall be the sum of at least 3 and an addend between 0 and 1 in accordance with Table 1. That addend shall depend on the number of overshootings for the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution's back-testing of the value-at-risk number as set out in Article 365(1).

3.   The institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing on hypothetical and actual changes in the portfolio's value. An overshooting is a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related one-day value-at-risk number generated by the institution's model. For the purpose of determining the addend the number of overshootings shall be assessed at least quarterly and shall be equal to the higher of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio.
Back-testing on hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and, assuming unchanged positions, its value at the end of the subsequent day.
Back-testing on actual changes in the portfolio's value shall be based on a comparison between the portfolio's end-of-day value and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day excluding fees, commissions, and net interest income.
4.   The competent authorities may in individual cases limit the addend to that resulting from overshootings under hypothetical changes, where the number of overshootings under actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model.
5.   In order to allow competent authorities to monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factors on an ongoing basis, institutions shall notify promptly, and in any case no later than within five working days, the competent authorities of overshootings that result form their back-testing programme.
Article 367
Requirements on risk measurement
1.   Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk, commodities risk and any internal model for correlation trading shall meet all of the following requirements:
(a)
the model shall capture accurately all material price risks;
(b)
the model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, depending on the level of activity of the institution in the respective markets. Where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution's pricing model but not into the risk-measurement model, the institution shall be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent authority. The risk- measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk. Where proxies for risk factors are used they shall show a good track record for the actual position held.
2.   Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements:
(a)
the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;
(b)
the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3);
(c)
the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;
(d)
the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions;
(e)
the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.
3.   Institutions may, in any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories only if the institution's approach for measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity.
Article 368
Qualitative requirements
1.   Any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity and, in particular, all of the following qualitative requirements shall be met:
(a)
any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk-management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;
(b)
the institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and reports directly to senior management. The unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter. The unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter, being responsible for the overall risk management system. The unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used for calculating capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk and commodities risk, and on the appropriate measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;
(c)
the institution's management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process and the daily reports produced by the risk-control unit are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient authority to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders as well as in the institution's overall risk exposure;
(d)
the institution shall have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter, in the trading, risk-control, audit and back-office areas;
(e)
the institution shall have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter;
(f)
any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter shall have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks;
(g)
the institution shall frequently conduct a rigorous programme of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which encompasses any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter and the results of these stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management and reflected in the policies and limits it sets. This process shall particularly address illiquidity of markets in stressed market conditions, concentration risk, one way markets, event and jump-to-default risks, non-linearity of products, deep out-of-the-money positions, positions subject to the gapping of prices and other risks that may not be captured appropriately in the internal models. The shocks applied shall reflect the nature of the portfolios and the time it could take to hedge out or manage risks under severe market conditions;
(h)
the institution shall conduct, as part of its regular internal auditing process, an independent review of its internal models, and including those used for purposes of this Chapter.
2.   The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk-control unit. At least once a year, the institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk-management process. The review shall consider the following:
(a)
the adequacy of the documentation of the risk-management system and process and the organisation of the risk-control unit;
(b)
the integration of risk measures into daily risk management and the integrity of the management information system;
(c)
the process the institution employs for approving risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;
(d)
the scope of risks captured by the risk-measurement model and the validation of any significant changes in the risk-measurement process;
(e)
the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, and the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations;
(f)
the verification process the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources used to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;
(g)
the verification process the institution uses to evaluate back-testing that is conducted to assess the models' accuracy.
3.   As techniques and best practices evolve, institutions shall apply those new techniques and practices in any internal model used for purposes of this Chapter.
Article 369
Internal Validation
1.   Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that all their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process to ensure that they are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. The validation shall be conducted when the internal model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the internal model. The validation shall also be conducted on a periodic basis but especially where there have been any significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal model no longer being adequate. As techniques and best practices for internal validation evolve, institutions shall apply these advances. Internal model validation shall not be limited to back-testing, but shall, at a minimum, also include the following:
(a)
tests to demonstrate that any assumptions made within the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk;
(b)
in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, institutions shall carry out their own internal model validation tests, including back-testing, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios;
(c)
the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example material basis risks and concentration risk.
2.   The institution shall perform back-testing on both actual and hypothetical changes in the portfolio's value.
Article 370
Requirements for modelling specific risk
An internal model used for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk and an internal model for correlation trading shall meet the following additional requirements:
(a)
it explains the historical price variation in the portfolio;
(b)
it captures concentration in terms of magnitude and changes of composition of the portfolio;
(c)
it is robust to an adverse environment;
(d)
it is validated through back-testing aimed at assessing whether specific risk is being accurately captured. If the institution performs such back-testing on the basis of relevant sub-portfolios, these shall be chosen in a consistent manner;
(e)
it captures name-related basis risk and shall in particular be sensitive to material idiosyncratic differences between similar but not identical positions;
(f)
it captures event risk.
Article 371
Exclusions from specific risk models
1.   An institution may choose to exclude from the calculation of its specific risk own funds requirement using an internal model those positions for which it fulfils an own funds requirement for specific risk in accordance with Article 332(1)(e) or Article 337 with exception of those positions that are subject to the approach set out in Article 377.
2.   An institution may choose not to capture default and migration risks for traded debt instruments in its internal model where it is capturing those risks through the requirements set out in Section 4.
Article 372
Requirement to have an internal IRC model
An institution that use an internal model for calculating own funds requirements for specific risk of traded debt instruments shall also have an internal incremental default and migration risk (IRC) model in place to capture the default and migration risks of its trading book positions that are incremental to the risks captured by the value-at-risk measure as specified in Article 365(1). The institution shall demonstrate that its internal model meets the following standards under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality:
(a)
the internal model provides a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent estimates of incremental default and migration risk;
(b)
the internal model's estimates for potential losses play an essential role in the risk management of the institution;
(c)
the market and position data used for the internal model are up-to-date and subject to an appropriate quality assessment;
(d)
the requirements in Article 367(3), Article 368, Article 369(1) and points (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 370 are met.
EBA shall issue guidelines on the requirements in Articles 373 to 376.
Article 373
Scope of the internal IRC model
The internal IRC model shall cover all positions subject to an own funds requirement for specific interest rate risk, including those subject to a 0 % specific risk capital charge under Article 336, but shall not cover securitisation positions and n-th-to-default credit derivatives.
The institution may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, choose to consistently include all listed equity positions and derivatives positions based on listed equities. The permission shall be granted if such inclusion is consistent with how the institution internally measures and manages risk.
Article 374
Parameters of the internal IRC model
1.   Institutions shall use the internal model to calculate a number which measures losses due to default and internal or external ratings migration at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.
2.   Correlation assumptions shall be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. The internal model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. Concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions shall also be reflected.
3.   The internal IRC model shall reflect the impact of correlations between default and migration events. The impact of diversification between, on the one hand, default and migration events and, on the other hand, other risk factors shall not be reflected.
4.   The internal model shall be based on the assumption of a constant level of risk over the one-year time horizon, implying that given individual trading book positions or sets of positions that have experienced default or migration over their liquidity horizon are re-balanced at the end of their liquidity horizon to attain the initial level of risk. Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a one-year constant position assumption.
5.   The liquidity horizons shall be set according to the time required to sell the position or to hedge all material relevant price risks in a stressed market, having particular regard to the size of the position. Liquidity horizons shall reflect actual practice and experience during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses. The liquidity horizon shall be measured under conservative assumptions and shall be sufficiently long that the act of selling or hedging, in itself, would not materially affect the price at which the selling or hedging would be executed.
6.   The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions is subject to a floor of three months.
7.   The determination of the appropriate liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions shall take into account an institution's internal policies relating to valuation adjustments and the management of stale positions. When an institution determines liquidity horizons for sets of positions rather than for individual positions, the criteria for defining sets of positions shall be defined in a way that meaningfully reflects differences in liquidity. The liquidity horizons shall be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting the longer period needed to liquidate such positions. The liquidity horizon for a securitisation warehouse shall reflect the time to build, sell and securitise the assets, or to hedge the material risk factors, under stressed market conditions.
Article 375
Recognition of hedges in the internal IRC model
1.   Hedges may be incorporated into an institution's internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks. Positions may be netted when long and short positions refer to the same financial instrument. Hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers, may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments. Institutions shall reflect the impact of material risks that could occur during the interval between the hedge's maturity and the liquidity horizon as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instruments. An institution shall reflect a hedge only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit or other event.
2.   For positions that are hedged via dynamic hedging strategies, a rebalancing of the hedge within the liquidity horizon of the hedged position may be recognised provided that the institution:
(a)
chooses to model rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading book positions;
(b)
demonstrates that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a better risk measurement;
(c)
demonstrates that the markets for the instruments serving as hedges are liquid enough to allow for such rebalancing even during periods of stress. Any residual risks resulting from dynamic hedging strategies shall be reflected in the own funds requirement.
Article 376
Particular requirements for the internal IRC model
1.   The internal model to capture the incremental default and migration risks shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options, structured credit derivatives and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. The institution shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with such products.
2.   The internal model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date.
3.   As part of the independent review and validation of their internal models used for purposes of this Chapter, inclusively for purposes of the risk measurement system, an institution shall in particular do all of the following:
(a)
validate that its modelling approach for correlations and price changes is appropriate for its portfolio, including the choice and weights of its systematic risk factors;
(b)
perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal model, particularly with regard to the treatment of concentrations. Such tests shall not be limited to the range of events experienced historically;
(c)
apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.
4.   The internal model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks.
5.   Institutions shall document their internal models so that its correlation and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.
6.   The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.
Article 377
Requirements for an internal model for correlation trading
1.   Competent authorities shall grant permission to use an internal model for the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio instead of the own funds requirement in accordance with Article 338 to institutions that are allowed to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments and that meet the requirements in paragraphs 2 to 6 of this Article and in Article 367(1) and (3), Article 368, Article 369(1) and points (a), (b), (c), (e) and (f) of Article 370.
2.   Institutions shall use this internal model to calculate a number which adequately measures all price risks at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a time horizon of one year under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality. Institutions shall calculate this number at least weekly.
3.   The following risks shall be adequately captured by the model referred to in paragraph 1:
(a)
the cumulative risk arising from multiple defaults, including different ordering of defaults, in tranched products;
(b)
credit spread risk, including the gamma and cross-gamma effects;
(c)
volatility of implied correlations, including the cross effect between spreads and correlations;
(d)
basis risk, including both of the following:
(i)
the basis between the spread of an index and those of its constituent single names;
(ii)
the basis between the implied correlation of an index and that of bespoke portfolios;
(e)
recovery rate volatility, as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices;
(f)
to the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates benefits from dynamic hedging, the risk of hedge slippage and the potential costs of rebalancing such hedges;
(g)
any other material price risks of positions in the correlation trading portfolio.
4.   An institution shall use sufficient market data within the model referred to in paragraph 1 in order to ensure that it fully captures the salient risks of those exposures in its internal approach in accordance with the requirements set out in this Article. It shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authority through back testing or other appropriate means that its model can appropriately explain the historical price variation of those products.
The institution shall have appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to separate the positions for which it holds permission to incorporate them in the own funds requirement in accordance with this Article from other positions for which it does not hold such permission.
5.   With regard to the portfolio of all the positions incorporated in the model referred to in paragraph 1, the institution shall regularly apply a set of specific, predetermined stress scenarios. Such stress scenarios shall examine the effects of stress to default rates, recovery rates, credit spreads, basis risk, correlations and other relevant risk factors on the correlation trading portfolio. The institution shall apply stress scenarios at least weekly and report at least quarterly to the competent authorities the results, including comparisons with the institution's own funds requirement in accordance with this Article. Any instances where the stress test results materially exceed the own funds requirement for the correlation trading portfolio shall be reported to the competent authorities in a timely manner. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of stress scenarios for the correlation trading portfolio.
6.   The internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio.
Article 378
Settlement/delivery risk
In the case of transactions in which debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities excluding repurchase transactions and securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing are unsettled after their due delivery dates, an institution shall calculate the price difference to which it is exposed.
The price difference is calculated as the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the credit institution.
The institution shall multiply that price difference by the appropriate factor in the right column of the following Table 1 in order to calculate the institution's own funds requirement for settlement risk.

Article 379
Free deliveries
1.   An institution shall be required to hold own funds, as set out in Table 2, where the following occurs:
(a)
it has paid for securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving them or it has delivered securities, foreign currencies or commodities before receiving payment for them;
(b)
in the case of cross-border transactions, one day or more has elapsed since it made that payment or delivery.

Treat as an exposure
Treat as an exposure risk weighted at 1 250  %
2.   In applying a risk weight to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may assign PDs to counterparties, for which it has no other non-trading book exposure, on the basis of the counterparty's external rating. Institutions using own estimates of ‧LGDs‧ may apply the LGD set out in Article 161(1) to free delivery exposures treated according to Column 3 of Table 2 provided that they apply it to all such exposures. Alternatively, an institution using the Internal Ratings Based approach set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may apply the risk weights of the Standardised Approach, as set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 provided that it applies them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures.
If the amount of positive exposure resulting from free delivery transactions is not material, institutions may apply a risk weight of 100 % to these exposures, except where a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1 is required.
3.   As an alternative to applying a risk weight of 1 250 % to free delivery exposures according to Column 4 of Table 2 in paragraph 1, institutions may deduct the value transferred plus the current positive exposure of those exposures from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (k) of Article 36(1).
Article 380
Waiver
Where a system wide failure of a settlement system, a clearing system or a CCP occurs, competent authorities may waive the own funds requirements calculated as set out in Articles 378 and 379 until the situation is rectified. In this case, the failure of a counterparty to settle a trade shall not be deemed a default for purposes of credit risk.
Article 381
Meaning of Credit Valuation Adjustment
For the purposes of this Title and Chapter 6 of Title II, ‧Credit Valuation Adjustment‧ or ‧CVA‧ means an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty. That adjustment reflects the current market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution, but does not reflect the current market value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.
Article 382
Scope
1.   An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with this Title for all OTC derivative instruments in respect of all of its business activities, other than credit derivatives recognised to reduce risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk.
2.   An institution shall include securities financing transactions in the calculation of own funds required by paragraph 1 if the competent authority determines that the institution's CVA risk exposures arising from those transactions are material.
3.   Transactions with a qualifying central counterparty and a client's transactions with a clearing member, when the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the client and a qualifying central counterparty and the transactions give rise to a trade exposure of the clearing member to the qualifying central counterparty, are excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk.
4.   The following transactions shall be excluded from the own funds requirements for CVA risk:
(a)
transactions with non-financial counterparties as defined in point (9) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, or with non-financial counterparties established in a third country, where those transactions do not exceed the clearing threshold as specified in Article 10(3) and (4) of that Regulation;
(b)
intragroup transactions as provided for in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 unless Member States adopt national laws requiring the structural separation within a banking group, in which case competent authorities may require those intragroup transactions between the structurally separated institutions to be included in the own funds requirements;
(c)
transactions with counterparties referred to in point (10) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and subject to the transitional provisions set out in Article 89(1) of that Regulation until those transitional provisions cease to apply;
(d)
transactions with counterparties referred to in Article 1(4)(a) and (b) and Article 1(5)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and transactions with counterparties for which Article 115 of this Regulation specifies a risk weight of 0 % for exposures to those counterparties.
The exemption from the CVA charge for those transactions referred to in point (c) of this paragraph) which are entered into during the transitional period laid down in Article 89(1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 shall apply for the length of the contract of that transaction.
5.   EBA shall conduct a review by 1 January 2015 and every two years thereafter, in the light of international regulatory developments and including on potential methodologies on the calibration and thresholds for application of CVA charges to non-financial counterparties established in a third country.
EBA in cooperation with ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the procedures for excluding transactions with non-financial counterparties established in a third country from the own funds requirement for CVA risk.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards within six months of the date of the review referred to in the first subparagraph,
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 383
Advanced method
1.   An institution which has permission to use an internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with point (d) of Article 363 (1) shall, for all transactions for which it has permission to use the IMM for determining the exposure value for the associated counterparty credit risk exposure in accordance with Article 283, determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk by modelling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads on the CVAs of all counterparties of those transactions, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 386.
An institution shall use its internal model for determining the own funds requirements for the specific risk associated with traded debt positions and shall apply a 99 % confidence interval and a 10-day equivalent holding period. The internal model shall be used in such way that it simulates changes in the credit spreads of counterparties, but does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes in other market factors, including changes in the value of the reference asset, commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative.
The own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:





where:
ti

=
the time of the i-th revaluation, starting from t0=0;
tT

=
the longest contractual maturity across the netting sets with the counterparty;
si

=
is the credit spread of the counterparty at tenor ti, used to calculate the CVA of the counterparty. Where the credit default swap spread of the counterparty is available, an institution shall use that spread. Where such a credit default swap spread is not available, an institution shall use a proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty;
LGDMKT

=
the LGD of the counterparty that shall be based on the spread of a market instrument of the counterparty if a counterparty instrument is available. Where a counterparty instrument is not available, it shall be based on the proxy spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty.
The first factor within the sum represents an approximation of the market implied marginal probability of a default occurring between times ti-1 and ti;
EEi

=
the expected exposure to the counterparty at revaluation time ti, where exposures of different netting sets for such counterparty are added, and where the longest maturity of each netting set is given by the longest contractual maturity inside the netting set; An institution shall apply the treatment set out in paragraph 3 in the case of margined trading, if the institution uses the EPE measure referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) for margined trades;
Di

=
the default risk-free discount factor at time ti, where D0 =1.
2.   When calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk for a counterparty, an institution shall base all inputs into its internal model for specific risk of debt instruments on the following formulae (whichever is appropriate):
(a)
where the model is based on full repricing, the formula in paragraph 1 shall be used directly;
(b)
where the model is based on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, an institution shall base each credit spread sensitivity (‧Regulatory CS01‧) on the following formula:





For the final time bucket i=T, the corresponding formula is





(c)
where the model uses credit spread sensitivities to parallel shifts in credit spreads, an institution shall use the following formula:





(d)
where the model uses second-order sensitivities to shifts in credit spreads (spread gamma), the gammas shall be calculated based on the formula in paragraph 1.
3.   An institution using the EPE measure for collateralised OTC derivatives referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 285(1) shall, when determining the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1, do both of the following:
(a)
assume a constant EE profile;
(b)
set EE equal to the effective expected exposure as calculated under Article 285(1)(b) for a maturity equal to the greater of the following:
(i)
half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;
(ii)
the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.
4.   An institution which is permitted by the competent authority in accordance with Article 283 to use IMM to calculate exposure values in relation to the majority of its business, but which uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for smaller portfolios, and which has permission to use the market risk internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with point (d) of Article 363(1) may, subject to permission from the competent authorities, calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 1 for the non-IMM netting sets. Competent authorities shall grant this permission only if the institution uses the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6 for a limited number of smaller portfolios.
For the purposes of a calculation under the preceding subparagraph and where the IMM model does not produce an expected exposure profile, an institution shall do both of the following:
(a)
assume a constant EE profile;
(b)
set EE equal to the exposure value as computed under the methods set out in Section 3, Section 4 or Section 5 of Title II, Chapter 6, or IMM for a maturity equal to the greater of:
(i)
half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set;
(ii)
the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting set.
5.   An institution shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 364(1) and Articles 365 and 367 as the sum of non-stressed and stressed Value-at-Risk, which shall be calculated as follows:
(a)
for the non-stressed Value-at-Risk, current parameter calibrations for expected exposure as set out in the first subparagraph of Article 292(2), shall be used;
(b)
for the stressed Value-at-Risk, future counterparty EE profiles using a stressed calibration as set out in the second subparagraph of Article 292(2) shall be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters shall be the most severe one-year stress period contained within the three-year stress period used for the exposure parameters;
(c)
the three-times multiplier used in the calculation of own funds requirements based on a Value-at-Risk and a stressed Value-at-Risk in accordance with 364(1) will apply to these calculations. EBA shall monitor for consistency any supervisory discretion used to apply a higher multiplier than that three-times multiplier to the Value-at-Risk and stressed Value-at-Risk inputs to the CVA charge. Competent authorities applying a multiplier higher than three shall provide a written justification to EBA;
(d)
the calculation shall be carried out on at least a monthly basis and the EE that is used shall be calculated on the same frequency. If lower than a daily frequency is used, for the purpose of the calculation specified in points (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) of Article 364(1) institutions shall take the average over three months.
6.   For exposures to a counterparty, for which the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments does not produce a proxy spread that is appropriate with respect to the criteria of rating, industry and region of the counterparty, the institution shall use the method set out in Article 384 to calculate the own funds requirement for CVA risk.
7.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in greater detail:
(a)
how a proxy spread is to be determined by the institution's approved internal model for the specific risk of debt instruments for the purposes of identifying si and LGDMKT referred to in paragraph 1;
(b)
the number and size of portfolios that fulfil the criterion of a limited number of smaller portfolios referred to in paragraph 4.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 384
Standardised method
1.   An institution which does not calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk for its counterparties in accordance with Article 383 shall calculate a portfolio own funds requirements for CVA risk for each counterparty in accordance with the following formula, taking into account CVA hedges that are eligible in accordance with Article 386:





where:
h
=
the one-year risk horizon (in units of a year); h = 1;
wi

=
the weight applicable to counterparty "i".
Counterparty "i" shall be mapped to one of the six weights wi based on an external credit assessment by a nominated ECAI, as set out in Table 1. For a counterparty for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available:
(a)
an institution using the approach in Title II, Chapter 3 shall map the internal rating of the counterparty to one of the external credit assessment;
(b)
an institution using the approach in Title II, Chapter 2 shall assign wi=1.0 % to this counterparty. However, if an institution uses Article 128 to risk weight counterparty credit risk exposures to this counterparty, wi=3.0 % shall be assigned;





=
the total counterparty credit risk exposure value of counterparty "i" (summed across its netting sets) including the effect of collateral in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of Title II, Chapter 6 as applicable to the calculation of the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk for that counterparty. An institution using one of the methods set out in Sections 3 and 4 of Title II, Chapter 6, may use as EADitotal the fully adjusted exposure value in accordance with Article 223(5).
For an institution not using the method set out in Section 6 of Title II, Chapter 6, the exposure shall be discounted by applying the following factor:
Bi

=
the notional of purchased single name credit default swap hedges (summed if more than one position) referencing counterparty "i" and used to hedge CVA risk.
That notional amount shall be discounted by applying the following factor:
Bind

=
is the full notional of one or more index credit default swap of purchased protection used to hedge CVA risk.
That notional amount shall be discounted by applying the following factor:
wind

=
is the weight applicable to index hedges.
An institution shall determine wind by calculating a weighted average of wi that are applicable to the individual constituents of the index;
Mi

=
the effective maturity of the transactions with counterparty i.
For an institution using the method set out in Section 6 of Title II, Chapter 6, Mi shall be calculated in accordance with Article 162(2)(g). However, for that purpose, Mi shall not be capped at five years but at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set.
For an institution not using the method set out in Section 6 of Title II, Chapter 6, Mi is the average notional weighted maturity as referred to in point (b) of Article 162(2). However, for that purpose, Mi shall not be capped at five years but at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set.





=
the maturity of the hedge instrument with notional Bi (the quantities Mi
hedge Bi are to be summed if these are several positions);
Mind

=
the maturity of the index hedge.
In the case of more than one index hedge position, Mind is the notional-weighted maturity.
2.   Where a counterparty is included in an index on which a credit default swap used for hedging counterparty credit risk is based, the institution may subtract the notional amount attributable to that counterparty in accordance with its reference entity weight from the index CDS notional amount and treat it as a single name hedge (Bi) of the individual counterparty with maturity based on the maturity of the index.

Article 385
Alternative to using CVA methods to calculating own funds requirements
As an alternative to Article 384, for instruments referred to in Article 382 and subject to the prior consent of the competent authority, institutions using the Original Exposure Method as laid down in Article 275, may apply a multiplication factor of 10 to the resulting risk-weighted exposure amounts for counterparty credit risk for those exposures instead of calculating own funds requirements for CVA risk.
Article 386
Eligible hedges
1.   Hedges shall be ‧eligible hedges‧ for the purposes of the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Articles 383 and 384 only where they are used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk and managed as such, and are one of the following:
(a)
single-name credit default swaps or other equivalent hedging instruments referencing the counterparty directly;
(b)
index credit default swaps, provided that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, in the Value-at-Risk.
The requirement in point (b) that the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is reflected in the Value-at-Risk shall also apply to cases where a proxy is used for the spread of a counterparty.
For all counterparties for which a proxy is used, an institution shall use reasonable basis time series out of a representative group of similar names for which a spread is available.
If the basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of index credit default swap hedges is not reflected to the satisfaction of the competent authority, then an institution shall reflect only 50 % of the notional amount of index hedges in the Value-at-Risk.
Over-hedging of the exposures with single name credit default swaps under the method laid out in Article 383 is not allowed.
2.   An institution shall not reflect other types of counterparty risk hedges in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk. In particular, tranched or nth-to-default credit default swaps and credit linked notes are not eligible hedges for the purposes the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk.
3.   Eligible hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk shall not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk as set out in Title IV or treated as credit risk mitigation other than for the counterparty credit risk of the same portfolio of transaction.

Article 389
Definition
For the purposes of this Part, ‧exposures‧, means any asset or off-balance sheet item referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2, without applying the risk weights or degrees of risk.
Article 390
Calculation of the exposure value
1.   Exposures arising from the items referred to in Annex II shall be calculated in accordance with one of the methods set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6.
2.   Institutions with a permission to use the Internal Model Method in accordance with Article 283 may use the Internal Model Method for calculating the exposure value for repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, margin lending transactions and long settlement transactions.
3.   The institutions that calculate the own funds requirements for their trading-book business in accordance with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2, Article 299 and Part Three, Title V and, as appropriate, with Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5, shall calculate the exposures to individual clients which arise on the trading book by adding together the following items:
(a)
the positive excess of an institution's long positions over its short positions in all the financial instruments issued by the client in question, the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated according to the methods laid down in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2;
(b)
the net exposure, in the case of the underwriting of a debt or an equity instrument;
(c)
the exposures due to the transactions, agreements and contracts referred to in Articles 299 and 378 to 380 with the client in question, such exposures being calculated in the manner laid down in those Articles, for the calculation of exposure values.
For the purposes of point (b), the net exposure is calculated by deducting those underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of a formal agreement reduced by the factors set out in Article 345.
For the purposes of point (b), institutions shall set up systems to monitor and control their underwriting exposures between the time of the initial commitment and the next business day in the light of the nature of the risks incurred in the markets in question.
For the purposes of point (c), Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 shall be excluded from the reference in Article 299.
4.   The overall exposures to individual clients or groups of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures of the trading book and those of the non-trading book.
5.   The exposures to groups of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures to individual clients in a group.
6.   Exposures shall not include any of the following:
(a)
in the case of foreign exchange transactions, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the two working days following payment;
(b)
in the case of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during five working days following payment or delivery of the securities, whichever the earlier;
(c)
in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking or financial instruments clearing, settlement and custody services to clients, delayed receipts in funding and other exposures arising from client activity which do not last longer than the following business day;
(d)
in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking, intra-day exposures to institutions providing those services;
(e)
exposures deducted from own funds in accordance with Articles 36, 56 and 66.
7.   In order to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients, in respect of clients to which the institution has exposures through transactions referred to in points (m) and (o) of Article 112 or through other transactions where there is an exposure to underlying assets, an institution shall assess its underlying exposures taking into account the economic substance of the structure of the transaction and the risks inherent in the structure of the transaction itself, in order to determine whether it constitutes an additional exposure.
8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following:
(a)
the conditions and methodologies used to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients in respect of the types of exposures referred to in paragraph 7;
(b)
the conditions under which the structure of the transaction referred to in paragraph 7 does not constitute an additional exposure.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 391
Definition of an institution for large exposures purposes
For the purposes of calculating the value of exposures in accordance with this Part the term ‧institution‧ shall include a private or public undertaking, including its branches, which, were it established in the Union, would fulfil the definition of the term ‧institution‧ and has been authorised in a third country that applies prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.
Article 392
Definition of a large exposure
An institution's exposure to a client or group of connected clients shall be considered a large exposure where its value is equal to or exceeds 10 % of its eligible capital.
Article 393
Capacity to identify and manage large exposures
An institution shall have sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms for the purposes of identifying, managing, monitoring, reporting and recording all large exposures and subsequent changes to them, in accordance with this Regulation.
Article 394
Reporting requirements
1.   An institution shall report the following information about every large exposure to the competent authorities, including large exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1):
(a)
the identification of the client or the group of connected clients to which an institution has a large exposure;
(b)

Where an institution is subject to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 its 20 largest exposures on a consolidated basis, excluding those exempted from the application of Article 395(1) shall be made available to the competent authorities.
2.   An institution shall report the following information to the competent authorities, in addition to reporting the information referred to in paragraph 1, in relation to its 10 largest exposures on a consolidated basis to institutions as well as its 10 largest exposures on a consolidated basis to unregulated financial entities, including large exposures exempted from the application of Article 395(1):
(a)
the identification of the client or the group of connected clients to which an institution has a large exposure;

(b)
the frequencies and dates of the reporting referred to in paragraph 3;
(c)
the IT solutions to be applied for the reporting referred to in paragraph 3.
EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 395
Limits to large exposures
1.   An institution shall not incur an exposure, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, to a client or group of connected clients the value of which exceeds 25 % of its eligible capital. Where that client is an institution or where a group of connected clients includes one or more institutions, that value shall not exceed 25 % of the institution's eligible capital or EUR 150 million, whichever the higher, provided that the sum of exposure values, after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403, to all connected clients that are not institutions does not exceed 25 % of the institution's eligible capital.
Where the amount of EUR 150 million is higher than 25 % of the institution's eligible capital the value of the exposure, after taking into account the effect of credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 shall not exceed a reasonable limit in terms of the institution's eligible capital. That limit shall be determined by the institution in accordance with the policies and procedures referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU, to address and control concentration risk. This limit shall not exceed 100 % of the institution's eligible capital.
Competent authorities may set a lower limit than EUR 150 million and shall inform EBA and the Commission thereof.
2.   EBA shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403 as well as the outcomes of developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures at the Union and international levels, issue guidelines by 31 December 2014 to set appropriate aggregate limits to such exposures or tighter individual limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework.
In developing those guidelines, EBA shall consider whether the introduction of additional limits would have a material detrimental impact on the risk profile of institutions established in the Union, on the provision of credit to the real economy or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets.
By 31 December 2015 the Commission shall assess the appropriateness and the impact of imposing limits on exposures to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework, taking into account Union and international developments in the area of shadow banking and large exposures as well as credit risk mitigation in accordance with Articles 399 to 403. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and the Council, together, if appropriate, with a legislative proposal on exposure limits to shadow banking entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework.
3.   Subject to Article 396, an institution shall at all times comply with the relevant limit laid down in paragraph 1.
4.   Assets constituting claims and other exposures onto recognised third-country investment firms may be subject to the same treatment as set out in paragraph 1.
5.   The limits laid down in this Article may be exceeded for the exposures on the institution's trading book if the following conditions are met:
(a)
the exposure on the non-trading book to the client or group of connected clients in question does not exceed the limit laid down in paragraph 1, this limit being calculated with reference to eligible capital, so that the excess arises entirely on the trading book;
(b)
the institution meets an additional own funds requirement on the excess in respect of the limit laid down in paragraph 1 which is calculated in accordance with Articles 397 and 398;
(c)
where 10 days or less have elapsed since the excess occurred, the trading-book exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question shall not exceed 500 % of the institution's eligible capital;
(d)
any excesses that have persisted for more than 10 days do not, in aggregate, exceed 600 % of the institution's eligible capital.
In each case in which the limit has been exceeded, the institution shall report the amount of the excess and the name of the client concerned and, where applicable, the name of the group of connected clients concerned, without delay to the competent authorities.
6.   For the purpose of this paragraph, structural measures mean measures adopted by a Member State and implemented by the relevant competent authorities of that Member State before the entry into force of a legal act explicitly harmonising such measures, that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 400(1)(f), where Member States adopt national laws requiring structural measures to be taken within a banking group, competent authorities may require the institutions of the banking group which hold deposits that are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes (30) or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country to apply a large exposure limit below 25 % but not lower than 15 % between 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015, and than 10 % from 1 July 2015 on a sub-consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(5) to intragroup exposures where these exposures consist of exposures to an entity that does not belong to the same subgroup as regards the structural measures.
For the purpose of this paragraph, the following conditions shall be met:
(a)
all entities belonging to a same subgroup as regards the structural measures are considered as one client or group of connected clients;
(b)
the competent authorities apply a uniform limit to the exposures referred to in the first subparagraph.
Applying this approach shall be without prejudice to effective supervision on a consolidated basis and shall not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole or form or create an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.
7.   Before adopting the specific structural measures as referred to in paragraph 6 relating to large exposures, the competent authorities shall notify the Council, the Commission, the competent authorities concerned and EBA at least two months prior to the publication of the decision to adopt the structural measures, and submit relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence of all of the following:
(a)
the scope of the activities that are subject to the structural measures;
(b)
an explanation as to why such draft measures are deemed to be suitable, effective and proportionate to protect depositors;
(c)
an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the measures on the internal market based on information which is available to the Member State.
8.   The power to adopt an implementing act to accept or reject the proposed national measures referred to in paragraph 7 is conferred on the Commission acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 464(2).
Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 7, EBA shall provide its opinion on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned. Competent authorities concerned may also provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned.
Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust and strong evidence that the measures have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits, the Commission shall, within two months of receiving the notification, reject the proposed national measures. Otherwise, the Commission shall accept the proposed national measures for an initial period of 2 years and where appropriate the measures may be subject to amendment.
The Commission shall only reject the proposed national measures if it considers the proposed national measures entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market or to the free movement of capital in accordance with the provisions of the TFEU.
The assessment of the Commission shall take account of the opinion of EBA and shall take into account the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 7.
Before the expiry of the measures, the competent authorities may propose new measures for the extension of the period of application for an additional period of 2 years each time. In this case, they shall notify the Commission, the Council, the competent authorities concerned and EBA. Approval of the new measures shall be subject to the process set out in this Article. This Article shall be without prejudice to Article 458.
Article 396
Compliance with large exposures requirements
1.   If, in an exceptional case, exposures exceed the limit set out in Article 395(1), the institution shall report the value of the exposure without delay to the competent authorities which may, where the circumstances warrant it, allow the institution a limited period of time in which to comply with the limit.
Where the amount of EUR 150 million referred to in Article 395(1) is applicable, the competent authorities may allow on a case-by-case basis the 100 % limit in terms of the institution's eligible capital to be exceeded.
2.   Where compliance by an institution on an individual or sub-consolidated basis with the obligations imposed in this Part is disapplied under Article 7(1), or the provisions of Article 9 are applied in the case of parent institutions in a Member State, measures shall be taken to ensure the satisfactory allocation of risks within the group.
Article 397
Calculating additional own funds requirements for large exposures in the trading book
1.   The excess referred to in Article 395(5)(b) shall be calculated by selecting those components of the total trading exposure to the client or group of connected clients in question which attract the highest specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V, the sum of which equals the amount of the excess referred to in point (a) of Article 395(5).
2.   Where the excess has not persisted for more than 10 days, the additional capital requirement shall be 200 % of the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, on these components.
3.   As from 10 days after the excess has occurred, the components of the excess, selected in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be allocated to the appropriate line in Column 1 of Table 1 in ascending order of specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V. The additional own funds requirement shall be equal to the sum of the specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or the Article 299 and Part Three, Title V requirements on these components, multiplied by the corresponding factor in Column 2 of Table 1.

Article 398
Procedures to prevent institutions from avoiding the additional own funds requirement
Institutions shall not deliberately avoid the additional own funds requirements set out in Article 397 that they would otherwise incur, on exposures exceeding the limit laid down in Article 395(1) once those exposures have been maintained for more than 10 days, by means of temporarily transferring the exposures in question to another company, whether within the same group or not, and/or by undertaking artificial transactions to close out the exposure during the 10-day period and create a new exposure.
Institutions shall maintain systems which ensure that any transfer which has the effect referred to in the first subparagraph is immediately reported to the competent authorities.
Article 399
Eligible credit mitigation techniques
1.   For the purposes of Articles 400 to 403 the term ‧guarantee‧ shall include credit derivatives recognised under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 other than credit linked notes.
2.   Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, where, under Articles 400 to 403 the recognition of funded or unfunded credit protection is permitted, this shall be subject to compliance with the eligibility requirements and other requirements set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.
3.   Where an institution relies upon Article 401(2), the recognition of funded credit protection shall be subject to the relevant requirements under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3. For the purposes of this Part, an institution shall not take into account the collateral referred to in Article 199(5) to (7), unless permitted under Article 402.
4.   Institutions shall analyse, to the extent possible, their exposures to collateral issuers, providers of unfunded credit protection and underlying assets pursuant to Article 390(7) for possible concentrations and where appropriate take action and report any significant findings to their competent authority.
Article 400
Exemptions
1.   The following exposures shall be exempted from the application of Article 395(1):
(a)
asset items constituting claims on central governments, central banks or public sector entities which, unsecured, would be assigned a 0 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;

2.   Competent authorities may fully or partially exempt the following exposures:
(a)
covered bonds falling within the terms of Article 129(1), (3) and (6);
(b)
asset items constituting claims on regional governments or local authorities of Member States where those claims would be assigned a 20 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 and other exposures to or guaranteed by those regional governments or local authorities, claims on which would be assigned a 20 % risk weight under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;
(c)

(g)
asset items constituting claims on central banks in the form of required minimum reserves held at those central banks which are denominated in their national currencies;
(h)
asset items constituting claims on central governments in the form of statutory liquidity requirements held in government securities which are denominated and funded in their national currencies provided that, at the discretion of the competent authority, the credit assessment of those central governments assigned by a nominated ECAI is investment grade;
(i)
50 % of medium/low risk off-balance sheet documentary credits and of medium/low risk off-balance sheet undrawn credit facilities referred to in Annex I and subject to the competent authorities' agreement, 80 % of guarantees other than loan guarantees which have a legal or regulatory basis and are given for their members by mutual guarantee schemes possessing the status of credit institutions;
(j)
legally required guarantees used when a mortgage loan financed by issuing mortgage bonds is paid to the mortgage borrower before the final registration of the mortgage in the land register, provided the guarantee is not used as reducing the risk in calculating the risk -weighted exposure amounts;
(k)
assets items constituting claims on and other exposures to recognised exchanges.
3.   Competent authorities may only make use of the exemption provided for in paragraph 2 where the following conditions are met:
(a)
the specific nature of the exposure, the counterparty or the relationship between the institution and the counterparty eliminate or reduce the risk of the exposure; and
(b)
any remaining concentration risk can be addressed by other equally effective means such as the arrangements, processes and mechanisms provided for in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
Competent authorities shall inform EBA whether or not they intend to use any of the exemptions provided for in paragraph 2 in accordance with points (a) and (b) of this paragraph and shall consult EBA on this choice.
Article 401
Calculating the effect of the use of credit risk mitigation techniques
1.   For calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) an institution may use the ‧fully adjusted exposure value‧ as calculated under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 taking into account the credit risk mitigation, volatility adjustments, and any maturity mismatch (E*).
2.   An institution permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 may, subject to a permission by the competent authorities recognise the effects of financial collateral in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1).
Competent authorities shall grant the permission referred to in preceding subparagraph only if the institution can estimate the effects of financial collateral on their exposures separately from other LGD-relevant aspects.
The estimates produced by the institution shall be sufficiently suitable for reducing the exposure value for the purposes of compliance with the provisions of Article 395.
Where an institution is permitted to use its own estimates of the effects of financial collateral, it shall do so on a basis consistent with the approach adopted in the calculation of the own funds requirements in accordance with this Regulation.
Institutions permitted to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors for an exposure class under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, which do not calculate the value of their exposures using the method referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, may use the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the approach set out in Article 403(1)(b) for calculating the value of exposures.
3.   An institution that makes use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or is permitted to use the method described in paragraph 2 of this Article in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall conduct periodic stress tests of their credit-risk concentrations, including in relation to the realisable value of any collateral taken.
These periodic stress tests referred to in the first subparagraph shall address risks arising from potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact the institutions' adequacy of own funds and risks arising from the realisation of collateral in stressed situations.
The stress tests carried out shall be adequate and appropriate for the assessment of such risks.
In the event that the periodic stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral taken than would be permitted to be taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2 as appropriate, the value of collateral permitted to be recognised in calculating the value of exposures for the purposes of Article 395(1) shall be reduced accordingly.
Institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall include the following in their strategies to address concentration risk:
(a)
policies and procedures to address risks arising from maturity mismatches between exposures and any credit protection on those exposures;
(b)
policies and procedures in the event that a stress test indicates a lower realisable value of collateral than taken into account while making use of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method or the method described in paragraph 2;
(c)
policies and procedures relating to concentration risk arising from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, and in particular large indirect credit exposures, for example to a single issuer of securities taken as collateral.
Article 402
Exposures arising from mortgage lending
1.   For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by real estate property in accordance with Article 125(1) by the pledged amount of the market or mortgage lending value of the property concerned but not more than 50 % of the market or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, if all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the competent authorities of the Member States have not set a higher risk weight than 35 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by residential real estate in accordance with Article 124(2);
(b)
the exposure or part of the exposure is fully secured by:
(i)
mortgages on residential property; or
(ii)
a residential property in a leasing transaction under which the lessor retains full ownership of the residential property and the lessee has not yet exercised his option to purchase;
(c)
the requirements in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met.
2.   For the calculation of exposure values for the purposes of Article 395, an institution may reduce the value of an exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by real estate property in accordance with Article 126(1) by the pledged amount of the market or mortgage lending value of the property concerned but not more than 50 % of the market or 60 % of the mortgage lending value in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, if all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the competent authorities of the Member States have not set a higher risk weight than 50 % for exposures or parts of exposures secured by commercial real estate in accordance with Article 124(2);
(b)
the exposure is fully secured by:
(i)
mortgages on offices or other commercial premises; or
(ii)
offices or other commercial premises and the exposures related to property leasing transactions;
(c)
the requirements in Article 126(2)(a), Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met;
(d)
the commercial property is fully constructed.
3.   An institution may treat an exposure to a counterparty that results from a reverse repurchase agreement under which the institution has purchased from the counterparty non-accessory independent mortgage liens on immovable property of third parties as a number of individual exposures to each of those third parties, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the counterparty is an institution;
(b)
the exposure is fully secured by liens on the immovable property of those third parties that have been purchased by the institution and the institution is able to exercise those liens;
(c)
the institution has ensured that the requirements in Article 208 and Article 229(1) are met;
(d)
the institution becomes beneficiary of the claims that the counterparty has against the third parties in the event of default, insolvency or liquidation of the counterparty;
(e)
the institution reports to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 394 the total amount of exposures to each other institution that are treated in accordance with this paragraph.
For these purposes, the institution shall assume that it has an exposure to each of those third parties for the amount of the claim that the counterparty has on the third party instead of the corresponding amount of the exposure to the counterparty. The remainder of the exposure to the counter party, if any, shall continue to be treated as an exposure to the counter party.
Article 403
Substitution approach
1.   Where an exposure to a client is guaranteed by a third party, or secured by collateral issued by a third party, an institution may:
(a)
treat the portion of the exposure which is guaranteed as having been incurred to the guarantor rather than to the client provided that the unsecured exposure to the guarantor would be assigned an equal or lower risk weight than a risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;
(b)
treat the portion of the exposure collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral as having been incurred to the third party rather than to the client, if the exposure is secured by collateral and provided that the collateralised portion of the exposure would be assigned an equal or lower risk weight than a risk weight of the unsecured exposure to the client under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2.
The approach referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall not be used by an institution where there is a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection.
For the purpose of this Part, an institution may use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph only where it is permitted to use both the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method and the Financial Collateral Simple Method for the purposes of Article 92.
2.   Where an institution applies point (a) of paragraph 1:
(a)
where the guarantee is denominated in a currency different from that in which the exposure is denominated the amount of the exposure deemed to be covered shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of currency mismatch for unfunded credit protection set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4;
(b)
a mismatch between the maturity of the exposure and the maturity of the protection shall be treated in accordance with the provisions on the treatment of maturity mismatch set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4;
(c)
partial coverage may be recognised in accordance with the treatment set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4.
PART FIVE

EXPOSURES TO TRANSFERRED CREDIT RISK

Article 404
Scope of application
Titles II and III shall apply to new securitisations issued on or after 1 January 2011. Titles II and III shall, after 31 December 2014, apply to existing securitisations where new underlying exposures are added or substituted after that date.
Article 405
Retained interest of the issuer
1.   An institution, other than when acting as an originator, a sponsor or original lender, shall be exposed to the credit risk of a securitisation position in its trading book or non-trading book only if the originator, sponsor or original lender has explicitly disclosed to the institution that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall not be less than 5 %.
Only any of the following qualifies as retention of a material net economic interest of not less than 5 %:
(a)
retention of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to the investors;
(b)
in the case of securitisations of revolving exposures, retention of the originator's interest of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures;
(c)
retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures, where such exposures would otherwise have been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures is no less than 100 at origination;
(d)
retention of the first loss tranche and, if necessary, other tranches having the same or a more severe risk profile than those transferred or sold to investors and not maturing any earlier than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals in total no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures;
(e)
retention of a first loss exposure not less than 5 % of every securitised exposure in the securitisation.
Net economic interest is measured at the origination and shall be maintained on an ongoing basis. The net economic interest, including retained positions, interest or exposures, shall not be subject to any credit risk mitigation or any short positions or any other hedge and shall not be sold. The net economic interest shall be determined by the notional value for off-balance sheet items.
There shall be no multiple applications of the retention requirements for any given securitisation.
2.   Where an EU parent credit institution, an EU financial holding company, an EU mixed financial holding company or one of its subsidiaries, as an originator or a sponsor, securitises exposures from several credit institutions, investment firms or other financial institutions which are included in the scope of supervision on a consolidated basis, the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 may be satisfied on the basis of the consolidated situation of the related EU parent credit institution, EU financial holding company, or EU mixed financial holding company.
The first subparagraph shall apply only where credit institutions, investment firms or financial institutions which created the securitised exposures have committed themselves to adhere to the requirements set out in Article 408 and deliver, in a timely manner, to the originator or sponsor and to the EU parent credit institution, EU financial holding company or EU mixed financial holding company the information needed to satisfy the requirements referred to in Article 409.
3.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the securitised exposures are exposures on or fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the following entities:
(a)
central governments or central banks;
(b)
regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities of Member States;
(c)
institutions to which a 50 % risk weight or less is assigned under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2;
(d)
multilateral development banks.
4.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to transactions based on a clear, transparent and accessible index, where the underlying reference entities are identical to those that make up an index of entities that is widely traded, or are other tradable securities other than securitisation positions.
Article 406
Due diligence
1.   Before becoming exposed to the risks of a securitisation, and as appropriate thereafter, institutions shall be able to demonstrate to the competent authorities for each of their individual securitisation positions, that they have a comprehensive and thorough understanding of and have implemented formal policies and procedures appropriate to their trading book and non-trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions for analysing and recording:
(a)
information disclosed under Article 405(1), by originators, sponsors or original lenders to specify the net economic interest that they maintain, on an ongoing basis, in the securitisation;
(b)
the risk characteristics of the individual securitisation position;
(c)
the risk characteristics of the exposures underlying the securitisation position;
(d)
the reputation and loss experience in earlier securitisations of the originators or sponsors in the relevant exposure classes underlying the securitisation position;
(e)
the statements and disclosures made by the originators or sponsors, or their agents or advisors, about their due diligence on the securitised exposures and, where applicable, on the quality of the collateral supporting the securitised exposures;
(f)
where applicable, the methodologies and concepts on which the valuation of collateral supporting the securitised exposures is based and the policies adopted by the originator or sponsor to ensure the independence of the valuer;
(g)
all the structural features of the securitisation that can materially impact the performance of the institution's securitisation position, such as the contractual waterfall and waterfall related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, market value triggers, and deal-specific definitions of default.
Institutions shall regularly perform their own stress tests appropriate to their securitisation positions. To this end, institutions may rely on financial models developed by an ECAI provided that institutions can demonstrate, when requested, that they took due care prior to investing to validate the relevant assumptions in and structuring of the models and to understand methodology, assumptions and results.
2.   Institutions, other than when acting as originators or sponsors or original lenders, shall establish formal procedures appropriate to their trading book and non-trading book and commensurate with the risk profile of their investments in securitised positions to monitor on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner performance information on the exposures underlying their securitisation positions. Where relevant, this shall include the exposure type, the percentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, collateral type and occupancy, and frequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures, industry and geographical diversification, frequency distribution of loan to value ratios with band widths that facilitate adequate sensitivity analysis. Where the underlying exposures are themselves securitisation positions, institutions shall have the information set out in this subparagraph not only on the underlying securitisation tranches, such as the issuer name and credit quality, but also on the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying those securitisation tranches.
Institutions shall also apply the same standards of analysis to participations or underwritings in securitisation issues purchased from third parties whether such participations or underwritings are to be held on their trading or non-trading book.
Article 407
Additional risk weight
Where an institution does not meet the requirements in Article 405, 406 or 409 in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the institution, the competent authorities shall impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight (capped at 1 250 %) which shall apply to the relevant securitisation positions in the manner specified in Article 245(6) or Article 337(3) respectively. The additional risk weight shall progressively increase with each subsequent infringement of the due diligence provisions.
The competent authorities shall take into account the exemptions for certain securitisations provided in Article 405(3) by reducing the risk weight it would otherwise impose under this Article in respect of a securitisation to which Article 405(3) applies.
Article 408
Criteria for credit granting
Sponsor and originator institutions shall apply the same sound and well-defined criteria for credit-granting in accordance with the requirements of Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU to exposures to be securitised as they apply to exposures to be held in their own non-trading book. To this end the same processes for approving and, where relevant, amending, renewing and re-financing credits shall be applied by the originator and sponsor institutions.
Where the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph of this Article are not met, Article 245(1) shall not be applied by an originator institution and that originator institution shall not be allowed to exclude the securitised exposures from the calculation of its capital requirements under this Regulation.
Article 409
Disclosure to investors
Institutions acting as an originator, a sponsor or original lender shall disclose to investors the level of their commitment under Article 405 to maintain a net economic interest in the securitisation. Sponsor and originator institutions shall ensure that prospective investors have readily available access to all materially relevant data on the credit quality and performance of the individual underlying exposures, cash flows and collateral supporting a securitisation exposure as well as such information that is necessary to conduct comprehensive and well informed stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values supporting the underlying exposures. For that purpose, materially relevant data shall be determined as at the date of the securitisation and where appropriate due to the nature of the securitisation thereafter.
Article 410
Uniform condition of application
1.   EBA shall report to the Commission annually on measures taken by the competent authorities in order to ensure the compliance with the requirements of Titles II and III by institutions.
2.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify in greater detail:
(a)
the requirements in Articles 405 and 406 applying to institutions becoming exposed to the risk of a securitisation;
(b)
the retention requirement, including the qualifying criteria for retaining a material net economic interest as referred to in Article 405 and the level of retention;
(c)
the due diligence requirements in Article 406 for institutions becoming exposed to a securitisation position; and
(d)
the requirements in Articles 408 and 409 applying to sponsor and originator institutions.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU)No 1093/2010.
3.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to facilitate the convergence of supervisory practices with regard to the implementation of Article 407, including the measures to be taken in the case of breach of the due diligence and risk management obligations.
EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Article 412
Liquidity coverage requirement
1.   Institutions shall hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity buffers which are adequate to face any possible imbalance between liquidity inflows and outflows under gravely stressed conditions over a period of thirty days. During times of stress, institutions may use their liquid assets to cover their net liquidity outflows.
2.   Institutions shall not count double liquidity inflows and liquid assets.
3.   Institutions may use the liquid assets referred to in paragraph 1 to meet their obligations under stressed circumstances as specified under Article 414.
4.   The provisions set out in Title II shall apply exclusively for the purposes of specifying reporting obligations set out in Article 415.
5.   Member States may maintain or introduce national provisions in the area of liquidity requirements before binding minimum standards for liquidity coverage requirements are specified and fully introduced in the Union in accordance with Article 460. Member States or competent authorities may require domestically authorised institutions, or a subset of those institutions, to maintain a higher liquidity coverage requirement up to 100 % until the binding minimum standard is fully introduced at a rate of 100 % in accordance with Article 460.

Article 414
Compliance with liquidity requirements
Where an institution does not meet, or expects not to meet the requirement set out in Article 412 or the general obligation set out in Article 413(1), including during times of stress, it shall immediately notify the competent authorities and shall submit without undue delay to the competent authorities a plan for the timely restoration of compliance with Article 412 or Article 413(1). Until compliance has been restored, the institution shall report the items referred to in Title II or Title III, as appropriate, daily by the end of each business day unless the competent authority authorises a lower reporting frequency and a longer reporting delay. Competent authorities shall only grant such authorisations based on the individual situation of an institution and taking into account the scale and complexity of the institution's activities. They shall monitor the implementation of the restoration plan and shall require a more speedy restoration if appropriate.
Article 415
Reporting obligation and reporting format
1.   Institutions shall report in a single currency, regardless of their actual denomination, to the competent authorities the items referred to in Titles II and III and their components, including the composition of their liquid assets in accordance with Article 416.

Institutions shall report the items in Title III. The reporting frequency shall not be less than monthly for items referred to in Title II and Annex III and not less than quarterly for items referred to in Title III.
The reporting formats shall include all the necessary information and shall allow EBA to assess whether secured lending and collateral swap transactions where liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) have been obtained against collateral that does not qualify under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) have been properly unwound.
2.   An institution shall report separately to the competent authorities of the home Member State the items referred to in paragraph 1 in the currency below when it has:
(a)
aggregate liabilities in a currency different from the reporting currency under paragraph 1 amounting to or exceeding 5 % of the institution's or the single liquidity sub-group's total liabilities; or
(b)
a significant branch in accordance with Article 51 of Directive 2013/36/EU in a host Member State using a currency different from the reporting currency under paragraph 1 of this Article.
3.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following:
(a)
uniform formats and IT solutions with associated instructions for frequencies and reference and remittance dates. The reporting formats and frequencies shall be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the different activities of the institutions and shall comprise the reporting required in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2;
(b)
additional liquidity monitoring metrics required, to allow competent authorities to obtain a comprehensive view of the liquidity risk profile, proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of an institution's activities.
EBA shall submit to the Commission those draft implementing technical standards for the items specified in point (a) by 1 February 2015 and for the items specified in point (b) by 1 January 2014.
Until the full introduction of binding liquidity requirements, competent authorities may continue to collect information through monitoring tools for the purpose of monitoring compliance with existing national liquidity standards.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

5.   Competent authorities that exercise supervision on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 112 of Directive 2013/36/EU shall upon request provide in a timely manner and by electronic means the following authorities with all reporting submitted by the institution in accordance with the uniform reporting formats referred to in paragraph 3:
(a)
the competent authorities and the national central bank of the host Member States in which there are significant branches in accordance with Article 51 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the parent institution or institutions controlled by the same parent financial holding company;
(b)
the competent authorities that have authorised subsidiaries of the parent institution or institutions controlled by the same parent financial holding company and the central bank of the same Member State;
(c)
EBA;
(d)
ECB.
6.   The competent authorities that have authorised an institution that is a subsidiary of a parent institution or parent financial holding company shall upon request provide in a timely manner and by electronic means the competent authorities that exercise supervision on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 111 of Directive 2013/36/EU, the central bank of the Member State where the institution is authorised and EBA all reporting submitted by the institution in accordance with the uniform reporting formats referred to in paragraph 3.
Article 416
Reporting on liquid assets
1.   Institutions shall report the following as liquid assets unless excluded by paragraph 2 and only if the liquid assets fulfil the conditions in paragraph 3:
(a)
cash and exposures to central banks to the extent that these exposures can be withdrawn at any time in times of stress. As regards deposits held with central banks, the competent authority and the central bank shall aim at reaching a common understanding regarding the extent to which minimum reserves can be withdrawn in times of stress;
(b)
other transferable assets that are of extremely high liquidity and credit quality;
(c)
transferable assets representing claims on or guaranteed by:
(i)
the central government of a Member State, a region with fiscal autonomy to raise and collect taxes, or of a third country in the domestic currency of the central or regional government, if the institution incurs a liquidity risk in that Member State or third country that it covers by holding those liquid assets;
(ii)
central banks and non-central government public sector entities in the domestic currency of the central bank and the public sector entity;
(iii)
the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Commission and multilateral development banks;
(iv)
the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism;
(d)
transferable assets that are of high liquidity and credit quality;
(e)
standby credit facilities granted by central banks within the scope of monetary policy to the extent that these facilities are not collateralised by liquid assets and excluding emergency liquidity assistance;
(f)
if the credit institution belongs to a network in accordance with legal or statutory provisions, the legal or statutory minimum deposits with the central credit institution and other statutory or contractually available liquid funding from the central credit institution or institutions that are members of the network referred to in Article 113(7), or eligible for the waiver provided in Article 10, to the extent that this funding is not collateralised by liquid assets.
Pending specification of a uniform definition in accordance with Article 460 of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality, institutions shall identify themselves in a given currency transferable assets that are respectively of high or extremely high liquidity and credit quality. Pending specification of a uniform definition, competent authorities may, taking into account the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5) provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying assets of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality. In the absence of such guidance, institutions shall use transparent and objective criteria to this end, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5).
2.   The following shall not be considered liquid assets:
(a)
assets that are issued by a credit institution unless they fulfil one of the following conditions:
(i)
they are bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) or asset backed instruments if demonstrated to be of the highest credit quality as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509 (3), (4) and (5);
(ii)
they are bonds as referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC other than those referred to in point (i) of this point;
(iii)
the credit institution has been set up by a Member State central or regional government and that government has an obligation to protect the economic basis of the institution and maintain its viability throughout its lifetime; or the asset is explicitly guaranteed by that government; or at least 90 % of the loans granted by the institution are directly or indirectly guaranteed by that government and the asset is predominantly used to fund promotional loans granted on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote that government's public policy objectives;
(b)
assets that are provided as collateral to the institution under reverse repo and securities financing transactions and that are held by the institution only as a credit risk mitigant and that are not legally and contractually available for use by the institution;
(c)
assets issued by any of the following:
(i)
an investment firm;
(ii)
an insurance undertaking;
(iii)
a financial holding company;
(iv)
a mixed financial holding company;
(v)
any other entity that performs one or more of the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU as its main business.
3.   In accordance with paragraph 1, institutions shall report assets that fulfil the following conditions as liquid assets:
(a)
they are unencumbered or stand available within collateral pools to be used for the obtaining of additional funding under committed but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution;
(b)
they are not issued by the institution itself or its parent or subsidiary institutions or another subsidiary of its parent institutions or parent financial holding company;
(c)
their price is generally agreed upon by markets participants and can easily be observed in the market, or their price can be determined by a formula that is easy to calculate based on publicly available inputs and does not depend on strong assumptions as is typically the case for structured or exotic products;
(d)
they are eligible collateral for standard liquidity operations of a central bank in a Member State or if the liquid assets are held to meet liquidity outflows in the currency of a third country, of the central bank of that third country;
(e)
they are listed on a recognised exchange or they are tradable on active outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets. These criteria shall be assessed separately for each market.
The conditions referred to in points (c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the assets referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1.
The condition referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph shall not apply in the case of liquid assets held to meet liquidity outflows in a currency in which there is an extremely narrow definition of central bank eligibility. In the case of liquid assets denominated in currencies of third countries, this exception shall apply and only apply if the competent authorities of the third country apply the same or an equivalent exception.
4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, pending the specification of a binding liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460 and in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report on:
(a)
other non-central bank eligible but tradable assets such as equities and gold based on transparent and objective criteria, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5);
(b)
other central bank eligible and tradable assets such as asset backed instruments of the highest credit quality as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509(3), (4) and (5);
(c)
other central bank eligible but non-tradable assets such as credit claims as established by EBA pursuant to the criteria in Article 509(3), (4) and (5).
5.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 3.
EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Before the entry into force of the technical standards referred to in the third subparagraph, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, where the competent authorities have applied that treatment before 1 January 2014.
6.   Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution provided that the requirements in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk, only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in the first sentence of Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets.
7.   Where a liquid asset ceases to be eligible in the stock of liquid assets, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 calendar days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 6, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.
Article 417
Operational requirements for holdings of liquid assets
The institution shall only report as liquid assets those holdings of liquid assets that meet the following conditions:
(a)
they are appropriately diversified. Diversification is not required in terms of assets corresponding to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
(b)
they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 416(1) which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question, unless the institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that it has appropriately hedged the ensuing currency risk;
(c)
the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function;
(d)
a portion of the liquid assets except those referred to in points (a), (c) and (e) of Article 416(1) is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or via simple repurchase agreements on an approved repurchase market for the following purposes:
(i)
to test the access to the market for these assets;
(ii)
to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liquidation of assets;
(iii)
to test the usability of the assets;
(iv)
to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress;
(e)
price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they are readily available to the treasury when needed and especially that they are not used in other ongoing operations, including:
(i)
hedging or other trading strategies;
(ii)
providing credit enhancements in structured transactions;
(iii)
covering operational costs.
(f)
the denomination of the liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows.
Article 418
Valuation of liquid assets
1.   The value of a liquid asset to be reported shall be its market value, subject to appropriate haircuts that reflect at least the duration, the credit and liquidity risk and typical repo haircuts in periods of general market stress. The haircuts shall not be less than 15 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1). If the institution hedges the price risk associated with an asset, it shall take into account the cash flow resulting from the potential close-out of the hedge.
2.   Shares or units in CIUs as referred to in Article 416(6) shall be subject to haircuts, looking through to the underlying assets as follows:
(a)
0 % for the assets referred to in point (a) of Article 416(1);
(b)
5 % for the assets referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
(c)
20 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1).
3.   The look-through approach referred to in paragraph 2 shall be applied as follows:
(a)
where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to assign them to points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1);
(b)
where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in descending order in the asset types referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1) until the maximum total investment limit is reached.
4.   Institutions shall develop robust methodologies and processes to calculate and report the market value and haircuts for shares or units in CIUs. Only where they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the materiality of the exposure does not justify the development of their own methodologies, institutions may rely on the following third parties to calculate and report the haircuts for shares or units in CIUs, in accordance with the methods set out in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3:
(a)
the depository institution of the CIU provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at this depository institution;
(b)
for other CIUs, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3)(a).
The correctness of the calculations by the depository institution or the CIU management company shall be confirmed by an external auditor.
Article 419
Currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets
1.   EBA shall assess the availability for institutions of the liquid assets referred to in point (b) of Article 416(1) in the currencies that are relevant for institutions established in the Union.
2.   Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:
(a)
by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows;
(b)
for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place.
3.   The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants.
4.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards listing the currencies which meet the conditions set out in this Article.
EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
5.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the derogations referred to in paragraph 2 including the conditions of their application.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 420
Liquidity outflows
1.   Pending the specification of a liquidity requirement in accordance with Article 460, liquidity outflows to be reported shall include:
(a)
the current amount outstanding for retail deposits as set out in Article 421;
(b)
the current amounts outstanding of other liabilities that come due, can be called for payout by the issuing institutions or by the provider of the funding or entail an implicit expectation of the provider of the funding that the institution would repay the liability during the next 30 days as set out in Article 422;
(c)
the additional outflows referred to in Article 423;
(d)
the maximum amount that can be drawn during the next 30 days from undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities, as set out in Article 424;
(e)
the additional outflows identified in the assessment in accordance with paragraph 2.
2.   Institutions shall regularly assess the likelihood and potential volume of liquidity outflows during the next 30 days as far as products or services are concerned, which are not captured in Articles 422, 423 and 424 and which they offer or sponsor or which potential purchasers would consider to be associated with them, including but not limited to liquidity outflows resulting from any contractual arrangements such as other off-balance sheet and contingent funding obligations, including, but not limited to committed funding facilities, un-drawn loans and advances to wholesale counterparties, mortgages that have been agreed but not yet drawn down, credit cards, overdrafts, planned outflows related to renewal or extension of new retail or wholesale loans, planned derivative payables and trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and in Annex I. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.
For this assessment, institutions shall take particular account of material reputational damage that could result from not providing liquidity support to such products or services. Institutions shall report not less than annually to the competent authorities those products and services for which the likelihood and potential volume of the liquidity outflows referred to in the first subparagraph are material and the competent authorities shall determine the outflows to be assigned. The competent authorities may apply an outflow rate up to 5 % for trade finance off-balance sheet related products, as referred to in Article 429 and Annex I.
The competent authorities shall at least annually report to EBA the types of products or services for which they have determined outflows on the basis of the reports from institutions. They shall in that report also explain the methodology applied to determine the outflows.
Article 421
Outflows on retail deposits
1.   Institutions shall separately report the amount of retail deposits covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country, and multiply by at least 5 % where the deposit is either of the following:
(a)
part of an established relationship making withdrawal highly unlikely;
(b)
held in a transactional account, including accounts to which salaries are regularly credited.
2.   Institutions shall multiply other retail deposits not referred to in paragraph 1 by at least 10 %.
3.   Taking into account the behaviour of local depositors as advised by competent authorities, EBA shall issue guidelines by 1 January 2014 on the criteria to determine the conditions of application of paragraphs 1 and 2 in relation to the identification of retail deposits subject to different outflows and the definitions of those products for purposes of this Title. Those guidelines shall take account of the likelihood of these deposits to lead to outflows of liquidity during the next 30 days. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.
4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage than provided for in those paragraphs if such percentage is provided by comparable third country reporting requirements.
5.   Institutions may exclude from the calculation of outflows certain clearly circumscribed categories of retail deposits as long as in each and every instance the institution rigorously applies the following for the whole category of those deposits, unless in individually justified circumstances of hardship for the depositor:
(a)
within 30 days, the depositor is not allowed to withdraw the deposit; or
(b)
for early withdrawals within 30 days, the depositor has to pay a penalty that includes the loss of interest between the date of withdrawal and the contractual maturity date plus a material penalty that does not have to exceed the interest due for the time elapsed between the date of deposit and the date of withdrawal.
Article 422
Outflows on other liabilities
1.   Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from the institution's own operating expenses by 0 %.
2.   Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 by:
(a)
0 % up to the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418 if they are collateralised by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416;
(b)
100 % over the value of the liquid assets in accordance with Article 418, if they are collateralized by assets that would qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416;
(c)
100 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416, with the exception of transactions covered by points (d) and (e) of this paragraph;
(d)
25 % if they are collateralized by assets that would not qualify as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 and the lender is the central government, a public sector entity of the Member State in which the credit institution has been authorised or has established a branch, or a multilateral development bank. Public sector entities that receive that treatment shall be limited to those that have a risk weight of 20 % or lower in accordance with Chapter 2, Title II of Part Three;
(e)
0 % if the lender is a central bank.
3.   Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits that have to be maintained:
(a)
by the depositor in order to obtain clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services from the institution;
(b)
in the context of common task sharing within an institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7) or as a legal or statutory minimum deposit by another entity being a Member of the same institutional protection scheme;
(c)
by the depositor in the context of an established operational relationship other than that mentioned in point (a);
(d)
by the depositor to obtain cash clearing and central credit institution services and where the credit institution belongs to a network in accordance with legal or statutory provisions;
by 5 % in the case of point (a) to the extent to which they are covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent deposit guarantee scheme in a third country and by 25 % otherwise.
Deposits from credit institutions placed at central credit institutions that are considered as liquid assets in accordance with Article 416(1)(f) shall be multiplied by 100 % outflow rate.
4.   Clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 only covers such services to the extent that they are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. They shall not merely consist in correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and the institution shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising its operational functioning.
Pending a uniform definition of an established operational relationship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria to identify an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising their operational functioning and shall report these criteria to the competent authorities. Competent authorities may, in the absence of a uniform definition, provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship.
5.   Institutions shall multiply liabilities resulting from deposits by clients that are not financial customers to the extent they do not fall under paragraphs 3 and 4 by 40 % and shall multiply the amount of these liabilities covered by a Deposit Guarantee Scheme in accordance with Directive 94/19/EC or an equivalent Deposit Guarantee Scheme in a third country by 20 %.
6.   Institutions shall take outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II into account on a net basis across counterparties and shall multiply them by 100 % in the case of a net outflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.
7.   Institutions shall separately report other liabilities that do not fall under paragraphs 1 to 5.
8.   Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower outflow percentage on a case-by-case basis, to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 7, when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the depositor is:
(i)
a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution;
(ii)
linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC;
(iii)
an institution falling within the same institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7);
(iv)
the central institution or a member of a network compliant with Article 400 (2)(d);
(b)
there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario;
(c)
a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the depositor by way of derogation from Article 425;
(d)
the institution and the depositor are established in the same Member State.
9.   Competent authorities may waive the conditions set out in point (d) of paragraph 8 where point (b) of Article 20(1) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such lower outflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in point (b) of Article 20(1). The fulfilment of the conditions for such lower outflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.
10.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 9.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 423
Additional Outflows
1.   Collateral other than assets referred to in Article 416(1)(a), (b) and (c), which is posted by the institution for contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, shall be subject to an additional outflow of 20 %.
2.   Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities all contracts entered into the contractual conditions of which lead, within 30 days following a material deterioration of the credit quality of the institution, to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs. If the competent authorities consider such contracts material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts corresponding to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in the credit quality of the institution such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of this material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities.
3.   The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on the institution's derivatives transactions, financing transactions and other contracts if material.
EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the conditions of application in relation to the notion of materiality and methods for the measurement of this additional outflow.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
4.   The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to the market value of securities or other assets sold short and to be delivered within the 30 days horizon unless the institution owns the securities to be delivered or has borrowed them at terms requiring their return only after the 30 day horizon and the securities do not form part of the institutions liquid assets.
5.   The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to:
(a)
the excess collateral the institution holds that can be contractually called at any time by the counterparty;
(b)
collateral that is due to be returned to a counterparty;
(c)
collateral that corresponds to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 that can be substituted for assets corresponding to assets that would not qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 without the consent of the institution.
6.   Deposits received as collateral shall not be considered liabilities for the purposes of Article 422 but will be subject to the provisions of this Article where applicable.
Article 424
Outflows from credit and liquidity facilities
1.   Institutions shall report outflows from committed credit facilities and committed liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn within the next 30 days. This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of any liquidity requirement that would be mandated under Article 420(2) for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of the value in accordance with Article 418 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral is held in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 416. The collateral to be provided shall not be assets issued by the counterparty of the facility or one of its affiliated entities. If the necessary information is available to the institution, the maximum amount that can be drawn for credit and liquidity facilities shall be determined as the maximum amount that could be drawn given the counterparty's own obligations or given the pre-defined contractual drawdown schedule coming due over the next 30 days.
2.   The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 5 % if they qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk.
3.   The maximum amount that can be drawn of undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days shall be multiplied by 10 % where they meet the following conditions:
(a)
they do not qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk;
(b)
they have been provided to clients that are not financial customers;
(c)
they have not been provided for the purpose of replacing funding of the client in situations where he is unable to obtain its funding requirements in the financial markets.
4.   The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling such an SSPE to purchase assets other than securities from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 % to the extent that it exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and where the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.
5.   The institutions shall report the maximum amount that can be drawn of other undrawn committed credit facilities and undrawn committed liquidity facilities within the next 30 days. This applies in particular to the following:
(a)
liquidity facilities that the institution has granted to SSPEs other than those referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3;
(b)
arrangements under which the institution is required to buy or swap assets from an SSPE;
(c)
facilities extended to credit institutions;
(d)
facilities extended to financial institutions and investment firms.
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 5, institutions which have been set up and are sponsored by at least one Member State's central or regional government may apply the treatments set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 also to credit and liquidity facilities that are provided to institutions for the sole purpose of directly or indirectly funding promotional loans qualifying for the exposure classes referred to in those paragraphs. By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 425(2), where those promotional loans are extended via another institution as intermediary (pass through loans), a symmetric in and outflow may be applied by institutions. Those promotional loans shall be available only to persons who are not financial customers on a non-competitive, not for profit basis in order to promote public policy objectives of the Union and/or that Member State's central or regional government. It shall only be possible to draw on such facilities following the reasonably expected demand for a promotional loan and up to the amount of such demand linked to a subsequent reporting on the use of the funds disbursed.
Article 425
Inflows
1.   Institutions shall report their liquidity inflows. Capped liquidity inflows shall be the liquidity inflows limited to 75 % of liquidity outflows. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from deposits placed with other institutions and qualifying for the treatments set out in Article 113(6) or (7) from this limit. Institutions may exempt liquidity inflows from monies due from borrowers and bond investors related to mortgage lending funded by bonds eligible for the treatment set out in Article 129(4), (5) or (6) or by bonds as referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC from this limit. Institutions may exempt inflows from promotional loans that the institutions have passed through. Subject to the prior approval of the competent authority responsible for supervision on an individual basis, the institution may fully or partially exempt inflows where the provider is a parent or a subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC.
2.   The liquidity inflows shall be measured over the next 30 days. They shall comprise only contractual inflows from exposures that are not past due and for which the institution has no reason to expect non-performance within the 30-day time horizon. Liquidity inflows shall be reported in full with the following inflows reported separately:
(a)
monies due from customers that are not financial customers for the purposes of principal payment shall be reduced by 50 % of their value or by the contractual commitments to those customers to extend funding, whichever is higher. This does not apply to monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 that are collateralised by liquid assets in accordance with Article 416 as referred to in point (d) of this paragraph.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this point, institutions that have received a commitment referred to in Article 424(6) in order for them to disburse a promotional loan to a final recipient may take an inflow into account up to the amount of the outflow they apply to the corresponding commitment to extend those promotional loans;
(b)
monies due from trade financing transactions referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 162(3) with a residual maturity of up to 30 days, shall be taken into account in full as inflows;
(c)
assets with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow provided that the contract allows the bank to withdraw and request payment within 30 days;
(d)
monies due from secured lending and capital market-driven transactions as defined in point (3) of Article 192 if they are collateralised by liquid assets as referred to in Article 416(1), shall not be taken into account up to the value net of haircuts of the liquid assets and shall be taken into account in full for the remaining monies due;
(e)
monies due that the institution owing those monies treats in accordance with Article 422(3) and (4), shall be multiplied by a corresponding symmetrical inflow;
(f)
monies due from positions in major index equity instruments provided there is no double counting with liquid assets;
(g)
any undrawn credit or liquidity facilities and any other commitments received shall not be taken into account.
3.   Outflows and inflows expected over the 30 day horizon from the contracts listed in Annex II shall be reflected on a net basis across counterparties and shall be multiplied by 100 % in the event of a net inflow. Net basis shall mean also net of collateral to be received that qualifies as liquid assets under Article 416.
4.   By way of derogation from point (g) of paragraph 2, competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a higher inflow on a case by case basis for credit and liquidity facilities when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
there are reasons to expect a higher inflow even under a combined market and idiosyncratic stress of the provider;
(b)
the counterparty is a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution or linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC or a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation or the central institution or a member of a network that is subject to the waiver referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;
(c)
a corresponding symmetric or more conservative outflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Articles 422, 423 and 424;
(d)
the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.
5.   Competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 4 where Article 20(1)(b) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such higher inflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in Article 20(1)(b). Fulfilment of the conditions for such higher inflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.
6.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the additional objective criteria referred to in paragraph 5.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2015.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

LEVERAGE

Article 429
Calculation of the leverage ratio
1.   Institutions shall calculate their leverage ratio in accordance with the methodology set out in paragraphs 2 to 11.
2.   The leverage ratio shall be calculated as an institution's capital measure divided by that institution's total exposure measure and shall be expressed as a percentage.
Institutions shall calculate the leverage ratio as the simple arithmetic mean of the monthly leverage ratios over a quarter.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the capital measure shall be the Tier 1 capital.
4.   The total exposure measure is the sum of the exposure values of all assets and off-balance sheet items not deducted when determining the capital measure referred to in paragraph 3.
Where institutions include a financial sector entity in which they hold a significant investment in accordance with Article 43 in their consolidation according to the applicable accounting framework, but not in their prudential consolidation in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One, they shall determine the exposure value for the significant investment not in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 5 of this Article but as the amount that is obtained by multiplying the amount defined in point (a) of this subparagraph with the factor defined in point (b) of this subparagraph:
(a)
the sum of the exposure values of all exposures of the financial sector entity in which the significant investment is held;
(b)
for all direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of the institution of the Common Equity Tier 1 instruments of the financial sector entity, the total amount of such items not deducted pursuant to Article 47 and point (b) of Article 48(1) divided by the total amount of such items.
5.   Institutions shall determine the exposure value of assets in accordance with the following principles:
(a)
the exposure values of assets excluding contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, means exposure values in accordance with the first sentence of Article 111(1);
(b)
physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce exposure values of assets;
(c)
loans shall not be netted with deposits.
6.   Institutions shall determine the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives including those that are off-balance sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Article 274.
In determining the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, institutions shall take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements, except contractual cross-product netting agreements, in accordance with Article 295.
7.   By way of derogation from paragraph 6, institutions may use the method set out in Article 275 to determine the exposure value of contracts listed in points 1 and 2 of Annex II only where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purposes of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92.
8.   When determining the potential future credit exposure of credit derivatives, institutions shall apply the principles laid down in Article 299(2) to all their credit derivatives, not just those assigned to the trading book.
9.   Institutions shall determine the exposure value of repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions including those that are off-balance sheet, in accordance with Article 220(1) to (3) and Article 222, and shall take into account the effects of master netting agreements, except contractual cross-product netting agreements, in accordance with Article 206.
10.   Institutions shall determine the exposure value of off-balance sheet items, except the items referred to in paragraphs 6 and 9 of this Article, in accordance with Article 111(1), subject to the following amendments to the conversion factors listed in that Article:

the conversion factor to be applied to the nominal value for undrawn credit facilities, which may be cancelled unconditionally at any time without notice, referred to in points 4(a) and (b) of Annex I, is 10 %;
(b)
the conversion factor for medium/low risk trade finance related off-balance sheet items referred to in point 3(a) of Annex I and to officially supported export credits related off-balance sheet items referred to in point 3(b)(i) of Annex I is 20 %;
(c)
the conversion factor for medium risk trade finance related off-balance sheet items referred to in points 2(a) and 2(b)(i) of Annex I and to officially supported export credits related off-balance sheet items referred to in point 2(b)(ii) of Annex I is 50 %;
(d)
the conversion factor for all other off-balance sheet items listed in Annex I is 100 %.
11.   Where national generally accepted accounting principles recognises fiduciary assets on balance sheet, in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 86/635/EEC, those assets may be excluded from the leverage ratio total exposure measure provided that they meet the criteria for non-recognition set out in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39, as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, and, where applicable, the criteria for non-consolidation set out in International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 10, as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.

Macroprudential or systemic risk identified at the level of a Member State
1.   Member States shall designate the authority in charge of the application of this Article. This authority shall be the competent authority or the designated authority.
2.   Where the authority determined in accordance with paragraph 1 identifies changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State and which that authority considers would better be addressed by means of stricter national measures, it shall notify the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the ESRB and EBA of that fact and submit relevant quantitative or qualitative evidence of all of the following:
(a)
the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk;
(b)
the reasons why such changes could pose a threat to financial stability at national level;
(c)
a justification of why Articles 124 and 164 of this Regulation and Articles 101, 103, 104, 105, 133, and 136 of Directive 2013/36/EU cannot adequately address the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, taking into account the relative effectiveness of those measures;
(d)

(i)
the level of own funds laid down in Article 92;
(ii)

3.   When authorised to apply national measures in accordance with this Article, the authorities determined in accordance with paragraph 1 shall provide relevant competent authorities or designated authorities in other Member States with all relevant information.
4.   The power to adopt an implementing act to reject the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of paragraph 2 is conferred on the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission.
Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the ESRB and EBA shall provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned.
Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.
In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.
The Council shall decide on the proposal by the Commission within one month after receipt of the proposal and state its reasons for rejecting or not rejecting the draft national measures.
The Council shall only reject the draft national measures if it considers that one or more of the following conditions are not complied with:
(a)
the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk are of such nature as to pose risk to financial stability at national level;
(b)
Articles 124 and 164 of this Regulation and Articles 101, 103, 104, 105, 133, and 136 of Directive 2013/36/EU cannot adequately address the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, taking into account the relative effectiveness of those measures;
(c)
the draft national measures are more suitable to address the identified macroprudential or systemic risk and do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market;
(d)
the issue concerns only one Member State; and
(e)
the risks have not already been addressed by other measures in this Regulation or in Directive 2013/36/EU.
The assessment of the Council shall take into account the opinion of the ESRB and EBA and shall be based on the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 2 by the authority determined in accordance with paragraph 1.
In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month after receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.
5.   Other Member States may recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article and apply them to domestically authorised branches located in the Member State authorised to apply the measures.
6.   Where Member States recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, they shall notify the Council, the Commission, EBA, the ESRB and the Member State authorised to apply the measures.
7.   When deciding whether to recognise the measures set in accordance with this Article, the Member State shall take into consideration the criteria set in paragraph 4.
8.   The Member State authorised to apply the measures may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more Member States which do not recognise the measures.
9.   Before the expiry of the authorisation issued in accordance with paragraph 4, the Member State shall, in consultation with the ESRB and EBA, review the situation and may adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 4, a new decision for the extension of the period of application of national measures for one additional year each time. After the first extension, the Commission shall in consultation with the ESRB and EBA review the situation at least annually.
10.   Notwithstanding the procedure as set out in paragraphs 3 to 9, Member States shall be allowed to increase the risk weights beyond those provided in this Regulation by up to 25 %, for those exposures identified in points (vi) and (vii) of paragraph 2(d) of this Article and tighten the large exposure limit provided in Article 395 by up to 15 % for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner, provided that the conditions and notification requirements in paragraph 2 of this Article are met.
Article 459
Prudential requirements
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 462, to impose, for a period of one year, stricter prudential requirements for exposures where this is necessary to address changes in the intensity of microprudential and macroprudential risks which arise from market developments in the Union or outside the Union affecting all Member States, and where the instruments of this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are not sufficient to address these risks, in particular upon the recommendation or opinion of the ESRB or EBA, concerning:
(a)
the level of own funds laid down in Article 92;
(b)
the requirements for large exposures laid down in Article 392 and Articles 395 to 403;
(c)
the public disclosure requirements laid down in Articles 431 to 455.

Article 460
Liquidity
1.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 462 to specify in detail the general requirement set out in Article 412(1). The delegated act adopted in accordance with this paragraph shall be based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, shall specify under which circumstances competent authorities have to impose specific in- and outflow levels on credit institutions in order to capture specific risks to which they are exposed and shall respect the thresholds set out in paragraph 2.
2.   The liquidity coverage requirement referred to in Article 412 shall be introduced in accordance with the following phasing-in:
(a)
60 % of the liquidity coverage requirement in 2015;

70 % as from 1 January 2016;
(c)
80 % as from 1 January 2017;
(d)
100 % as from 1 January 2018.
For this purpose the Commission shall take into account the reports referred to in Article 509(1), (2) and (3) and international standards developed by international fora as well as Union specificities.
The Commission shall adopt the delegated act referred to in paragraph 1 by 30 June 2014. It shall enter into force by 31 December 2014, but shall not apply before 1 January 2015.
Article 461
Review of the phasing-in of the liquidity coverage requirement
1.   EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, by 30 June 2016 report to the Commission on whether the phase-in of the liquidity coverage requirement as specified in Article 460(2) should be amended.

Treatment of equity exposures under the IRB Approach
1.   By way of derogation from Chapter 3 of Part Three, until 31 December 2017, the competent authorities may exempt from the IRB treatment certain categories of equity exposures held by institutions and EU subsidiaries of institutions in that Member State as at 31 December 2007. The competent authority shall publish the categories of equity exposures which benefit from that treatment in accordance with Article 143 of Directive 2013/36/EU.
The exempted position shall be measured as the number of shares as at 31 December 2007 and any additional share arising directly as a result of owning those holdings, provided they do not increase the proportional share of ownership in a portfolio company.
If an acquisition increases the proportional share of ownership in a specific holding the part of the holding which constitutes the excess shall not be subject to the exemption. Nor shall the exemption apply to holdings that were originally subject to the exemption, but have been sold and then bought back.
Equity exposures subject to this provision shall be subject to the capital requirements calculated in accordance with the Standardised Approach under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2 and the requirements set out in Title IV of Part Three, as applicable.
Competent authorities shall notify the Commission and EBA of the implementation of this paragraph.
2.   In the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 114(4), until 31 December 2015 the same risk weight shall be assigned in relation to exposures to the central governments or central banks of Member States denominated and funded in the domestic currency of any Member State as would be applied to such exposures denominated and funded in their domestic currency.
3.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which competent authorities shall afford the exemption referred to in paragraph 1.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 June 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

(a)
the securitised residential or commercial immovable property exposures were originated by a member of the same consolidated group of which the issuer of the covered bonds is a member, or by an entity affiliated to the same central body to which the issuer of the covered bonds is affiliated, where that common group membership or affiliation shall be determined at the time the senior units are made collateral for covered bonds;
(b)
a member of the same consolidated group of which the issuer of the covered bonds is a member, or an entity affiliated to the same central body to which the issuer of the covered bonds is affiliated, retains the whole first loss tranche supporting those senior units.
2.   Until 31 December 2014, for the purposes of point (c) of Article 129(1), institutions' senior unsecured exposures which qualified for a 20 % risk weight under national law before the entry into force of this Regulation shall be considered to qualify for credit quality step 1.
3.   Until 31 December 2014, for the purposes of Article 129(5), institutions' senior unsecured exposures which qualified for a 20 % risk weight under national law before the entry into force of this Regulation shall be considered to qualify for a 20 % risk weight.

3.   The Commission may adopt an implementing act under Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 extending the transitional provisions in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article by a further six months, in exceptional circumstances where it is necessary and proportionate to avoid disruption to international financial markets.
4.   Up until the deadlines defined in paragraphs 1 and 2, and extended under paragraph 3, as applicable, where a CCP does not have a default fund and it does not have in place a binding arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, an institution shall substitute the right formula for calculating the own funds requirement (Ki) in Article 308(2) with the following one:

1.   Until 31 December 2017, institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 and institutions using the Advanced Measurement Approaches as specified in Part Three, Title III, Chapter 4 for the calculation of their own funds requirements for operational risk shall meet both of the following requirements:
(a)
they shall hold own funds as required by Article 92;
(b)
they shall hold own funds which are at all times more than or equal to 80 % of the total minimum amount of own funds that the institution would be required to hold under Article 4 of Directive 93/6/EEC as that Directive and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (36) stood prior to 1 January 2007.
2.   Subject to the approval of the competent authorities, the amount referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 may be replaced by a requirement to hold own funds which are at all times more than or equal to 80 % of the own funds that the institution would be required to hold under Article 92 calculating risk weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 2, and Part Three, Title III, Chapter 2 or 3, as applicable, instead of in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, or Part Three, Title III, Chapter 4, as applicable.

(b)
an SME is defined in accordance with Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (37). Among the criteria listed in Article 2 of the Annex to that Recommendation only the annual turnover shall be taken into account;
(c)
the total amount owed to the institution and parent undertakings and its subsidiaries, including any exposure in default, by the obligor client or group of connected clients, but excluding claims or contingent claims secured on residential property collateral, shall not, to the knowledge of the institution, exceed EUR 1,5 million.

Cyclicality of capital requirements
The Commission, in cooperation with EBA, ESRB and the Member States, and taking into account the opinion of the ECB, shall periodically monitor whether this Regulation taken as a whole, together with Directive 2013/36/EU has significant effects on the economic cycle and, in the light of that examination, shall consider whether any remedial measures are justified. By 31 December 2013, EBA shall report to the Commission if and how methodologies of institutions under the IRB Approach should converge with a view to more comparable capital requirements while mitigating pro-cyclicality.
Based on that analysis and taking into account the opinion of the ECB, the Commission shall draw up a biennial report and submit it to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate proposals. Contributions from credit taking and credit lending parties shall be adequately acknowledged when the report is drawn up.
By 31 December 2014 the Commission shall review and report on the application of Article 33(1)(c) and shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, together with a legislative proposal if appropriate.

1.   The Commission shall, by 31 December 2014, after consulting EBA, report to the European Parliament and to the Council, together with any appropriate proposals, on whether the risk weights laid down in Article 129 and the own funds requirements for specific risk in Article 336(3) are adequate for all the instruments that qualify for these treatments and whether the criteria in Article 129 are appropriate.
2.   The report and the proposals referred to in paragraph 1 shall have regard to:
(a)
the extent to which the current regulatory capital requirements applicable to covered bonds adequately differentiate between variances in the credit quality of covered bonds and the collateral against which they are secured, including the extent of variations across Member States;
(b)
the transparency of the covered bond market and the extent to which this facilitates comprehensive internal analysis by investors in respect of the credit risk of covered bonds and the collateral against which they are secured and the asset segregation in case of the issuer's insolvency, including the mitigating effects of the underlying strict national legal framework in accordance with Article 129 of this Regulation and Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC on the overall credit quality of a covered bond and its implications on the level of transparency needed by investors; and
(c)
the extent to which covered bond issuance by a credit institution impacts on the credit risk to which other creditors of the issuing institution are exposed.
3.   The Commission shall, by 31 December 2014, after consulting EBA, report to the European Parliament and the Council on whether loans secured by aircrafts (aircraft liens) and whether residential loans secured by a guarantee, but not secured by a registered mortgage, should under certain conditions be considered as an eligible asset in accordance with Article 129.
4.   The Commission shall, by 31 December 2016, review the appropriateness of the derogation set out in Article 496 and, if relevant, the appropriateness of extending similar treatment to any other form of covered bond.

Credit risk – definition of default
EBA shall, by 31 December 2017, report to the Commission on how replacing 90 days by 180 days past due, as provided in point (b) of Article 178(1), impacts risk-weighted exposure amounts and the appropriateness of the continued application of that provision after 31 December 2019.
On the basis of that report, the Commission may submit a legislative proposal to amend this Regulation.
Article 507

Article 508
Level of application
1.   By 31 December 2014, the Commission shall review and report on the application of Part One, Title II, and Article 113(6) and (7) and shall submit that report to the European Parliament and the Council, together with a legislative proposal if appropriate.

Where appropriate the report shall be followed by a legislative proposal.
Article 509
Liquidity requirements
1.   EBA shall monitor and evaluate the reports made in accordance with Article 415(1), across currencies and across different business models. EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, non-financial end-users, the banking industry, competent authorities and the ESCB central banks annually and for the first time by 31 December 2013 report to the Commission on whether a specification of the general liquidity coverage requirement in Part Six based on the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title II and Annex III, considered either individually or cumulatively, is likely to have a material detrimental impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets or on the economy and the stability of the supply of bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes.
The report referred to in the first subparagraph shall take due account of markets and international regulatory developments as well as of the interactions of the liquidity coverage requirement with other prudential requirements under this Regulation such as the risk based capital ratios as set out in Article 92 and the leverage ratio.
The European Parliament and the Council shall be given the opportunity to state their views on the report referred to in the first subparagraph.
2.   EBA shall in the report referred to in paragraph 1 assess the following in particular:
(a)
the provision of mechanisms restricting the value of liquidity inflows, in particular with a view to determining an appropriate inflow cap and the conditions for its application, taking into account different business models including pass through financing, factoring, leasing, covered bonds, mortgages, issuance of covered bonds, and the extent to which that cap should be amended or removed to cater for the specificities of specialised financing;
(b)
the calibration of inflows and outflows referred to in Part Six, Title II, in particular under Article 422(7) and Article 425(2);
(c)
the provision of mechanisms restricting the coverage of liquidity requirements by certain categories of liquid assets, in particular assessing the appropriate minimum percentage for liquid assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1) to the total of liquid assets, testing a threshold of 60 % and taking into account international regulatory developments. Assets owed and due or callable within 30 calendar days should not count towards the limit unless the assets have been obtained against collateral that also qualifies under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
(d)
the provision of specific lower outflow and/or higher inflow rates for intragroup flows, specifying under which conditions such specific in- or outflow rates would be justified from a prudential point of view and setting out the high level outline of a methodology using objective criteria and parameters in order to determine specific levels of inflows and outflows between the institution and the counterparty when they are not established in the same Member State;
(e)
the calibration of the draw-down rates applicable to the undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities that fall under Article 424(3) and (5). In particular, EBA shall test a draw-down rate of 100 %;
(f)
the definition of retail deposit in point (2) of Article 411, in particular the appropriateness of introducing a threshold on deposits of natural persons;
(g)
the need to introduce a new retail deposit category with a lower outflow in the light of the specific characteristics of such deposits that could justify a lower outflow rate and taking into account international developments;
(h)
derogations from requirements on the composition of the liquid assets institutions will be required to hold, where in a given currency the institutions' collective justified needs for liquid assets are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets and conditions to which such derogations should be subject;
(i)
the definition of Shari'ah-compliant financial products as an alternative to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, for the use of Shari'ah-compliant banks;

(m)
mechanisms for the grandfathering of government guaranteed bonds issued to credit institutions as part of Government support measures with Union State aid approval, such as bonds issued by the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in Ireland and by the Spanish Asset Management Company in Spain, designed to remove problem assets from the balance sheets of credit institutions, as assets of extremely high liquidity and credit quality until at least December 2023.
3.   EBA shall, after consulting ESMA and the ECB, by 31 December 2013, report to the Commission on appropriate uniform definitions of high and of extremely high liquidity and credit quality of transferable assets for the purposes of Article 416 and appropriate haircuts for assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416, with the exception of assets referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1).

(a)
uniform definitions of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality;
(b)
the possible unintended consequences of the definition of liquid assets on the conduct of monetary policy operation and the extent to which:
(i)
a list of liquid assets that is disconnected from the list of central bank eligible assets may incentivise institutions to submit eligible assets which are not included in the definition of liquid assets in refinancing operations;
(ii)
regulation of liquidity may disincentivise institutions to lend or borrow on the unsecured money market and whether this may lead to question the targeting of EONIA in monetary policy implementation;
(iii)
the introduction of the liquidity coverage requirement may make it more difficult for central banks to ensure price stability by using the existing monetary policy framework and instruments;
(c)
the operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets, as referred in points (b) to (f) of Article. 417, in line with international regulatory developments.

1.   By 31 December 2015, EBA shall report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III, on whether and how it would be appropriate to ensure that institutions use stable sources of funding, including an assessment of the impact on the business and risk profile of institutions established in the Union or on financial markets or the economy and bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes and pass through financing models, including match funded mortgage lending. In particular EBA shall analyse the impact of stable sources of funding on the refinancing structures of different banking models in the Union.
2.   By 31 December 2015, EBA shall also report to the Commission, on the basis of the items to be reported in accordance with Part Six, Title III and in accordance with the uniform reporting formats referred to in point (a) of Article 415(3) and after consulting the ESRB, on methodologies for determining the amount of stable funding available to and required by institutions and on appropriate uniform definitions for calculating such a net stable funding requirement, examining in particular the following:

the categories and weightings applied to determine the requirement for stable funding in Article 428(1);
(c)
methodologies shall provide incentives and disincentives as appropriate to encourage a more stable longer term funding of assets, business activities, investment and funding of institutions;
(d)

1.   Based on the results of the report referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission shall submit by 31 December 2016 a report on the impact and effectiveness of the leverage ratio to the European Parliament and the Council.
2.   Where appropriate, the report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal on the introduction of an appropriate number of levels of the leverage ratio that institutions following different business models would be required to meet, suggesting an adequate calibration for those levels and any appropriate adjustments to the capital measure and the total exposure measure as referred to in Article 429, together with any connected flexibility measures if necessary, including appropriate amendments to Article 458 to introduce the leverage ratio within the scope of measures included in that Article.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, EBA shall report to the Commission by 31 October 2016 on at least the following:
(a)
whether the leverage ratio framework provided by this Regulation and Articles 87 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU is the appropriate tool to suppress the risk of excessive leverage on the part of the institutions in a satisfactory manner and degree;
(b)
on identifying business models that reflect the overall risk profiles of the institutions and on introducing differentiated levels of the leverage ratio for those business models;
(c)
whether the requirements laid out in Articles 76 and 87 of Directive 2013/36/EU in accordance with Articles 73 and 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU for addressing the risk of excessive leverage are sufficient to ensure sound management of this risk by institutions and, if not, which further enhancements are needed in order to ensure these objectives;
(d)
whether – and if so, which - changes to the calculation methodology referred to in Article 429 would be necessary to ensure that the leverage ratio can be used as an appropriate indicator of an institution's risk of excessive leverage;
(e)
whether, in the context of the calculation of the total exposure measure of the leverage ratio, the exposure value of contracts listed in Annex II determined by using the Original Exposure Method differs in a material way from the exposure value determined by using the Mark-to-Market Method;
(f)
whether using either own funds or Common Equity Tier 1 capital as the capital measure of the leverage ratio could be more appropriate for the intended purpose of tracking the risk of excessive leverage and, if so, what would be the appropriate calibration of the leverage ratio;
(g)
whether the conversion factor referred to in point (a) of Article 429(10) for undrawn credit facilities, which may be cancelled unconditionally at any time without notice, is appropriately conservative based on the evidence collected during the observation period;
(h)
whether the frequency and format of the disclosure of items referred to in Article 451 are adequate;
(i)
what would be the appropriate level for the leverage ratio for each of the business models indentified in accordance with point (b);
(j)
whether a range for each level of the leverage ratio should be defined;
(k)
whether introducing the leverage ratio as a requirement for institutions would necessitate any changes to the leverage ratio framework provided by this Regulation and, if so, which ones;
(l)
whether introducing the leverage ratio as a requirement for institutions would effectively constrain the risk of excessive leverage on the part of those institutions, and, if so, whether the level for the leverage ratio should be the same for all institutions or should be determined according to the risk profile and business model as well as the size of institutions and, with regard to this, which additional calibrations or transition period would be required.
4.   The report referred to in paragraph 3 shall cover at least the period from 1 January 2014 until 30 June 2016 and shall take account of at least the following:
(a)
the impact of introducing the leverage ratio, determined in accordance with Article 429, as a requirement that institutions would have to meet on:
(i)
financial markets in general and markets for repurchase transactions, derivatives and covered bonds in particular;
(ii)
the robustness of institutions;
(iii)
business models and balance-sheet structures of institutions; in particular as regards low-risk areas of business, such as promotional credit by public development banks, municipal loans, financing of residential property and other low-risk areas regulated under national law;
(iv)
the migration of exposures to entities which are not subject to prudential supervision;
(v)
financial innovation, in particular the development of instruments with embedded leverage;
(vi)
institutions' risk-taking behaviour;
(vii)
clearing, settlement and custody activities and the operation of a central counterparty;
(viii)
cyclicality of the capital measure and the total exposure measure of the leverage ratio;
(ix)
bank lending, with a particular focus on lending to SMEs, local authorities, regional governments and public sector entities and on trade financing, including lending under official export credit insurance schemes;
(b)
the interaction of the leverage ratio with the risk-based own funds requirements and the liquidity requirements as specified in this Regulation;
(c)
the impact of accounting differences between accounting standards applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, accounting standards applicable under Directive 86/635/EEC and other applicable accounting framework and other relevant accounting frameworks on the comparability of the leverage ratio.

By 31 December 2014 the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application and effectiveness of the provisions of Part Five in the light of international market developments.
Article 513
Macroprudential rules
1.   By 30 June 2014, the Commission shall, after consulting the ESRB and EBA, review whether the macroprudential rules contained in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are sufficient to mitigate systemic risks in sectors, regions and Member States including assessing:
(a)
whether the current macroprudential tools in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and transparent;
(b)
whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap between different macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU are adequate and, if appropriate, propose new macroprudential rules;
(c)
how internationally agreed standards for systemic institutions interacts with the provisions in this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU and, if appropriate, propose new rules taking into account those internationally agreed standards.
2.   By 31 December 2014, the Commission shall, on the basis of the consultation with the ESRB and EBA, report to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 and, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.

RW
=
a risk weight of 20 %;
capital ratio
=
8 %.
3.   A CCP shall undertake the calculation required by paragraph 2 at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those of its clearing members which are institutions.
4.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following for the purpose of paragraph 3:

(i)
for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(ii)
for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation.

(b)
for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in Part Three, Title II of that Regulation;
(c)
when calculating the values referred to in point (a), the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(d)
a CCP shall calculate its securities financing transaction exposures to its clearing members in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive method, with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(e)
where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP;
(f)
where a CCP has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the CCP shall consider that initial margin as prefunded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;
(g)
when applying the Mark-to-Market Method, a CCP shall replace the formula in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 with the following:



;
where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and just before the variation margin is actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is the gross replacement cost;
(h)
when applying the Mark-to-Market Method as set out in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall replace the formula in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of that Regulation with the following:





where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of that Regulation and just before variation margins are actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is gross replacement cost;
(i)
where a CCP cannot calculate the value of NGR as set out in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it shall:
(i)
notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities about its inability to calculate NGR and the reasons why it is unable to carry out the calculation;
(ii)
for a period of three months, it may use a value of NGR of 0,3 to perform the calculation of PCEred specified in point (g);
(j)
where, at the end of the period specified in point (ii) of point (i), the CCP would still be unable to calculate the value of NGR, it shall do the following:
(i)
stop calculating KCCP;
(ii)
notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities that it has stopped calculating KCCP;
(k)





(l)
where a CCP has more than one default fund, it shall carry out the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2) for each default fund separately.
Article 50c
Reporting of information
1.   For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall report the following information to those of its clearing members which are institutions and to their competent authorities:
(a)
the hypothetical capital (KCCP);
(b)
the sum of pre-funded contributions (DFCM);
(c)
the amount of its pre-funded financial resources that it is required to use - by law or due to a contractual agreement with its clearing members - to cover its losses following the default of one or more of its clearing members before using the default fund contributions of the remaining clearing members (DFCCP);
(d)
the total number of its clearing members (N);
(e)
the concentration factor (β), as set out in Article 50d;

3.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following:
(a)
the uniform template for the purpose of the reporting specified in paragraph 1;
(b)
the frequency and dates of the reporting specified in paragraph 2;
(c)
the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of reporting than those referred to in point (b).
EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
Article 50d
Calculation of specific items to be reported by the CCP
For the purposes of Article 50c, the following shall apply:
(a)
where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources in parallel to the pre-funded contributions of its clearing members in a manner that makes those resources equivalent to pre-funded contributions of a clearing member in terms of how they absorb the losses incurred by the CCP in the case of the default or insolvency of one or more of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those resources to DFCM;
(b)








.
(c)
a CCP shall calculate the concentration factor (β) in accordance with the following formula:

=
the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with clearing member i;
PCEred,1

=
the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the largest PCEred value;
