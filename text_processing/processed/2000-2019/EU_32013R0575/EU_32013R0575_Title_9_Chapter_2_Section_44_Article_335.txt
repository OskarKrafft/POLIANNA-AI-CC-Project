Article 335
Cap on the own funds requirement for a net position
The institution may cap the own funds requirement for specific risk of a net position in a debt instrument at the maximum possible default-risk related loss. For a short position, that limit may be calculated as a change in value due to the instrument or, where relevant, the underlying names immediately becoming default risk-free.
