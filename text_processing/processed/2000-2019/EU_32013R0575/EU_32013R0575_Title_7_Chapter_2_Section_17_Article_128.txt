Article 128
Items associated with particular high risk
1.   Institutions shall assign a 150 % risk weight to exposures, including exposures in the form of shares or units in a CIU that are associated with particularly high risks, where appropriate.
2.   Exposures with particularly high risks shall include any of the following exposures:
(a)
investments in venture capital firms;
(b)
investments in AIFs as defined in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 2011/61/EU except where the mandate of the fund does not allow a leverage higher than that required under Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;
(c)
investments in private equity;
(d)
speculative immovable property financing.
3.   When assessing whether an exposure other than exposures referred to in the paragraph 2 is associated with particularly high risks, institutions shall take into account the following risk characteristics:
(a)
there is a high risk of loss as a result of a default of the obligor;
(b)
it is impossible to assess adequately whether the exposure falls under point (a).
EBA shall issue guidelines specifying which types of exposures are associated with particularly high risk and under which circumstances.
Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
