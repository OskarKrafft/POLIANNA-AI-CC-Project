Article 213
Requirements common to guarantees and credit derivatives
1.   Subject to Article 214(1), credit protection deriving from a guarantee or credit derivative shall qualify as eligible unfunded credit protection where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the credit protection is direct;
(b)
the extent of the credit protection is clearly defined and incontrovertible;
(c)
the credit protection contract does not contain any clause, the fulfilment of which is outside the direct control of the lender, that:
(i)
would allow the protection provider to cancel the protection unilaterally;
(ii)
would increase the effective cost of protection as a result of a deterioration in the credit quality of the protected exposure;
(iii)
could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original obligor fails to make any payments due, or when the leasing contract has expired for the purposes of recognising guaranteed residual value under Articles 134(7) and 166(4);
(iv)
could allow the maturity of the credit protection to be reduced by the protection provider;
(d)
the credit protection contract is legally effective and enforceable in all jurisdictions which are relevant at the time of the conclusion of the credit agreement.
2.   An institution shall demonstrate to competent authorities that it has in place systems to manage potential concentration of risk arising from its use of guarantees and credit derivatives. An institution shall be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities how its strategy in respect of its use of credit derivatives and guarantees interacts with its management of its overall risk profile.
3.   An institution shall fulfil any contractual and statutory requirements in respect of, and take all steps necessary to ensure, the enforceability of its unfunded credit protection under the law applicable to its interest in the credit protection.
An institution shall have conducted sufficient legal review confirming the enforceability of the unfunded credit protection in all relevant jurisdictions. It shall repeat such review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.
