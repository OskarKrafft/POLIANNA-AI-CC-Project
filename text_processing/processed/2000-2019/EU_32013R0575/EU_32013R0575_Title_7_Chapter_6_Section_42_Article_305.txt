Article 305
Treatment of clients' exposures
1.   Where an institution is a client, it shall calculate the own funds requirements for its CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Sections 1 to 8 of this Chapter and with Title VI of Part Three, as applicable.
2.   Without prejudice to the approach specified in paragraph 1, where an institution is a client, it may calculate the own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306 provided that all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the positions and assets of that institution related to those transactions are distinguished and segregated, at the level of both the clearing member and the CCP, from the positions and assets of both the clearing member and the other clients of that clearing member and as a result of that distinction and segregation those positions and assets are bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of the clearing member or one or more of its other clients;
(b)
laws, regulations, rules and contractual arrangements applicable to or binding that institution or the CCP facilitate the transfer of the client's positions relating to those contracts and transactions and of the corresponding collateral to another clearing member within the applicable margin period of risk in the event of default or insolvency of the original clearing member. In such circumstance, the client's positions and the collateral shall be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value;
(c)
the institution has available an independent, written and reasoned legal opinion that concludes that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that the client would bear no losses on account of the insolvency of its clearing member or of any of its clearing member's clients under the laws of the jurisdiction of the institution, its clearing member and the CCP, the law governing the transactions and contracts the institution clears through the CCP, the law governing the collateral, and the law governing any contract or agreement necessary to meet the condition in point (b);
(d)
the CCP is a QCCP.
3.   Without prejudice to the conditions specified in paragraph 2, where an institution that is a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and another client of the clearing member jointly default, but all the other conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met, the client may calculate the own funds requirements for its trade exposures for CCP-related transactions with its clearing member in accordance with Article 306, subject to replacing the 2 % risk weight in paragraph 1(a) of that Article with a 4 % risk weight.
4.   Where an institution that is a client accesses the services of a CCP through indirect clearing arrangements, in accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, that institution may apply the treatment set out in paragraph 2 or 3 only where the conditions in each paragraph are met at every level of the chain of intermediaries.
