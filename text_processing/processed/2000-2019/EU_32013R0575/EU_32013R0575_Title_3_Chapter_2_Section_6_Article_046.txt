(a)
the aggregate amount by which the direct, indirect and synthetic holdings by the institution of the Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments of financial sector entities in which the institution does not have a significant investment exceeds 10 % of the aggregate amount of Common Equity Tier 1 items of the institution calculated after applying the following to Common Equity Tier 1 items:
(i)
Articles 32 to 35;
(ii)

(iii)
Articles 44 and 45;

2.   Institutions shall exclude underwriting positions held for five working days or fewer from the amount referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 and from the calculation of the factor referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1.

5.   Institutions shall determine the portion of holdings of own funds instruments that is risk weighted by dividing the amount specified in point (a) by the amount specified in point (b):
(a)
the amount of holdings required to be risk weighted pursuant to paragraph 4;
(b)
the amount specified in point (i) divided by the amount specified in point (ii):
