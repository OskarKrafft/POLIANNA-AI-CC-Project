Article 317
Own funds requirement
1.   Under the Standardised Approach, institutions shall divide their activities into the business lines set out in Table 2 of paragraph 4 and in accordance with the principles set out in Article 318.
2.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk as the average over three years of the sum of the annual own funds requirements across all business lines referred to in Table 2 of paragraph 4. The annual own funds requirement of each business line is equal to the product of the corresponding beta factor referred to in that Table and the part of the relevant indicator mapped to the respective business line.
3.   In any given year, institutions may offset negative own funds requirements resulting from a negative part of the relevant indicator in any business line with positive own funds requirements in other business lines without limit. However, where the aggregate own funds requirement across all business lines within a given year is negative, institutions shall use the value zero as the input to the numerator for that year.
4.   Institutions shall calculate the average over three years of the sum referred to in paragraph 2 on the basis of the last three twelve-monthly observations at the end of the financial year. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates.
Where an institution can prove to its competent authority that, due to a merger, an acquisition or a disposal of entities or activities, using a three year average to calculate the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk, the competent authority may permit institutions to amend the calculation in a way that would take into account such events and shall duly inform EBA thereof. In such circumstances, the competent authority may, on its own initiative, also require an institution to amend the calculation.
Where an institution has been in operation for less than three years it may use forward-looking business estimates in calculating the relevant indicator, provided that it starts using historical data as soon as it is available.
