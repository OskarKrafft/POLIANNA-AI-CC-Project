Article 237
Maturity mismatch
1.   For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts, a maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of the credit protection is less than that of the protected exposure. Where protection has a residual maturity of less than three months and the maturity of the protection is less than the maturity of the underlying exposure that protection does not qualify as eligible credit protection.
2.   Where there is a maturity mismatch the credit protection shall not qualify as eligible where either of the following conditions is met:
(a)
the original maturity of the protection is less than 1 year;
(b)
the exposure is a short term exposure specified by the competent authorities as being subject to a one-day floor rather than a one-year floor in respect of the maturity value (M) under Article 162(3).
