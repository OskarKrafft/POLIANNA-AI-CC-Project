Article 198
Additional eligibility of collateral under the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method
1.   In addition to the collateral established in Article 197, where an institution uses the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method set out in Article 223, that institution may use the following items as eligible collateral:
(a)
equities or convertible bonds not included in a main index but traded on a recognised exchange;
(b)
units or shares in CIUs where both the following conditions are met:
(i)
the units or shares have a daily public price quote;
(ii)
the CIU is limited to investing in instruments that are eligible for recognition under Article 197(1) and (4) and the items mentioned in point (a) of this subparagraph.
In the case a CIU invests in units or shares of another CIU, conditions (a) and (b) of this paragraph equally apply to any such underlying CIU.
The use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge permitted investments shall not prevent units or shares in that undertaking from being eligible as collateral.
2.   Where the CIU or any underlying CIU are not limited to investing in instruments that are eligible for recognition under Article 197(1) and (4) and the items mentioned in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use units or shares in that CIU as collateral to an amount equal to the value of the eligible assets held by that CIU under the assumption that that CIU or any of its underlying CIUs have invested in non-eligible assets to the maximum extent allowed under their respective mandates.
Where non-eligible assets can have a negative value due to liabilities or contingent liabilities resulting from ownership, institutions shall do both of the following:
(a)
calculate the total value of the non-eligible assets;
(b)
where the amount obtained under point (a) is negative, subtract the absolute value of that amount from the total value of the eligible assets.
