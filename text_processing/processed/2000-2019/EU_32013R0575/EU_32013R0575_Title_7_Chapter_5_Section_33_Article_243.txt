Article 243
Traditional securitisation
1.   The originator institution of a traditional securitisation may exclude securitised exposures from the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts if either of the following conditions is fulfilled:
(a)
significant credit risk associated with the securitised exposures is considered to have been transferred to third parties;
(b)
the originator institution applies a 1 250 % risk weight to all securitisation positions it holds in this securitisation or deducts these securitisation positions from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with Article 36(1)(k).
2.   Significant credit risk shall be considered to have been transferred in the following cases:
(a)
the risk-weighted exposure amounts of the mezzanine securitisation positions held by the originator institution in this securitisation do not exceed 50 % of the risk weighted exposure amounts of all mezzanine securitisation positions existing in this securitisation;
(b)
where there are no mezzanine securitisation positions in a given securitisation and the originator can demonstrate that the exposure value of the securitisation positions that would be subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 or a 1 250 % risk weight exceeds a reasoned estimate of the expected loss on the securitised exposures by a substantial margin, the originator institution does not hold more than 20 % of the exposure values of the securitisation positions that would be subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 or a 1 250 % risk weight.
Where the possible reduction in risk weighted exposure amounts, which the originator institution would achieve by this securitisation is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, competent authorities may decide on a case-by-case basis that significant credit risk shall not be considered to have been transferred to third parties.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, mezzanine securitisation positions mean securitisation positions to which a risk weight lower than 1 250 % applies and that are more junior than the most senior position in this securitisation and more junior than any securitisation position in this securitisation to which either of the following is assigned in accordance with Section 4:
(a)
in the case of a securitisation position subject to Section 3, Sub-section 3 a credit quality step 1;
(b)
in the case of a securitisation position subject to points Section 3, Sub-section 4 a credit quality step 1 or 2.
4.   As an alternative to paragraphs 2 and 3, competent authorities shall grant permission to originator institutions to consider significant credit risk as having been transferred where the originator institution is able to demonstrate, in every case of a securitisation, that the reduction of own funds requirements which the originator achieves by the securitisation is justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties.
Permission shall be granted only where the institution meets all of the following conditions:
(a)
the institution has appropriately risk-sensitive policies and methodologies in place to assess the transfer of risk;
(b)
the institution has also recognised the transfer of credit risk to third parties in each case for purposes of the institution's internal risk management and its internal capital allocation.
5.   In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 4, as applicable, all the following conditions shall be met:
(a)
the securitisation documentation reflects the economic substance of the transaction;
(b)
the securitised exposures are put beyond the reach of the originator institution and its creditors, including in bankruptcy and receivership. This shall be supported by the opinion of qualified legal counsel;
(c)
the securities issued do not represent payment obligations of the originator institution;
(d)
the originator institution does not maintain effective or indirect control over the transferred exposures. An originator shall be considered to have maintained effective control over the transferred exposures if it has the right to repurchase from the transferee the previously transferred exposures in order to realise their benefits or if it is obligated to re-assume transferred risk. The originator institution's retention of servicing rights or obligations in respect of the exposures shall not of itself constitute indirect control of the exposures;
(e)
the securitisation documentation meets all the following conditions:
(i)
it does not contain clauses that other than in the case of early amortisation provisions, require positions in the securitisation to be improved by the originator institution including but not limited to altering the underlying credit exposures or increasing the yield payable to investors in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the securitised exposures;
(ii)
it does not contain clauses that increase the yield payable to holders of positions in the securitisation in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying pool;
(iii)
it makes it clear, where applicable, that any purchase or repurchase of securitisation positions by the originator or sponsor beyond its contractual obligations is exceptional and may only be made at arms' lengths conditions;
(f)
where there is a clean-up call option, that option shall also meet the following conditions:
(i)
it is exercisable at the discretion of the originator institution;
(ii)
it may only be exercised when 10 % or less of the original value of the exposures securitised remains unamortised;
(iii)
it is not structured to avoid allocating losses to credit enhancement positions or other positions held by investors and is not otherwise structured to provide credit enhancement.
6.   The competent authorities shall keep EBA informed about the specific cases, referred to in paragraph 2, where the possible reduction in risk-weighted exposure amounts is not justified by a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties, and the use institutions make of paragraph 4. EBA shall monitor the range of practices in this area and shall, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, issue guidelines. EBA shall review Member States' implementation of those guidelines and provide advice to the Commission by 31 December 2017 on whether a binding technical standard is required.
