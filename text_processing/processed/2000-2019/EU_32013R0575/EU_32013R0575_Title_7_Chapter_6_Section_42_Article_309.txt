where c2·and μ are defined as in Article 308(3).
2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, unfunded contributions means contributions that an institution acting as a clearing member has contractually committed to provide to a CCP after the CCP has depleted its default fund to cover the losses it incurred following the default of one or more of its clearing members.
3.   An institution shall calculate the risk weighted exposure amounts for exposures arising from an institution's pre-funded contribution for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the own funds requirement (Ki) determined in accordance with paragraph 1 multiplied by 12,5.
