Article 214
Sovereign and other public sector counter-guarantees
1.   Institutions may treat the exposures referred to in paragraph 2 as protected by a guarantee provided by the entities listed in that paragraph, provided all the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)
the counter-guarantee covers all credit risk elements of the claim;
(b)
both the original guarantee and the counter-guarantee meet the requirements for guarantees set out in Articles 213 and 215(1), except that the counter-guarantee need not be direct;
(c)
the cover is robust and nothing in the historical evidence suggests that the coverage of the counter-guarantee is less than effectively equivalent to that of a direct guarantee by the entity in question.
2.   The treatment set out in paragraph 1 shall apply to exposures protected by a guarantee which is counter-guaranteed by any of the following entities:
(a)
a central government or central bank;
(b)
a regional government or local authority;
(c)
a public sector entity, claims on which are treated as claims on the central government in accordance with Article 116(4);
(d)
a multilateral development bank or an international organisation, to which a 0 % risk weight is assigned under or by virtue of Articles 117(2) and 118 respectively;
(e)
a public sector entity, claims on which are treated in accordance with Article 116(1) and (2).
3.   Institutions shall apply the treatment set out in paragraph 1 also to an exposure which is not counter-guaranteed by any entity listed in paragraph 2 where that exposure's counter-guarantee is in turn directly guaranteed by one of those entities and the conditions listed in paragraph 1 are satisfied.
