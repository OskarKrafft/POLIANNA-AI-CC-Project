Article 279
Treatment of Collateral
For the determination of risk positions, institutions shall treat collateral as follows:
(a)
collateral received from a counterparty shall be treated as a claim on the counterparty under a derivative contract (long position) that is due on the day the determination is made;
(b)
collateral it has posted with the counterparty shall be treated as an obligation to the counterparty (short position) that is due on the day the determination is made.
