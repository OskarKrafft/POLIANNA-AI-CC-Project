Article 11
Review
By 31 December 2016, the Commission shall review the implementation of this Regulation, and present a report on the results of that review to the European Parliament and to the Council. In the review, the Commission shall, inter alia, examine:
(a)
the possible extension of the scope of this Regulation to include:
(i)
the extraction of gas, oil and coal;
(ii)
terminals for compressed natural gas;
(iii)
additional types of electricity storage; and
(b)
the question as to whether or not thresholds for renewable energy installations should be lowered.
In examining those options, the Commission shall take into account the need to ensure a balance between the increased administrative burden and the benefits of acquiring the additional information.
