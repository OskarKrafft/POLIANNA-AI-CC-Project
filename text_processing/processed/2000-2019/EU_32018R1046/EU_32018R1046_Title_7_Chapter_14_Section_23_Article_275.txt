Article 16a
CEF blending facilities
1.   CEF blending facilities in accordance with Article 159 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*8) may be established under this Regulation for one or more of the CEF sectors. All actions contributing to projects of common interest shall be eligible to receive financial assistance through blending operations.
2.   CEF blending facilities shall be implemented in accordance with Article 6(3).
3.   The overall contribution from the Union budget to CEF blending facilities shall not exceed 10 % of the overall financial envelope of the CEF as referred to in Article 5(1).
In addition to the threshold set out in the first subparagraph, in the transport sector the overall contribution from the Union budget to CEF blending facilities shall not exceed EUR 500 000 000.
If 10 % of the overall financial envelope for the implementation of the CEF referred to in Article 5(1) is not fully used for CEF blending facilities and/or financial instruments, the remaining amount shall be made available for and redistributed to that financial envelope.
4.   The amount of EUR 11 305 500 000 transferred from the Cohesion Fund, referred to in point (a) of Article 5(1), shall not be used to commit budgetary resources to CEF blending facilities.
5.   Support provided under a CEF blending facility in the form of grants and financial instruments shall comply with the eligibility and conditions for financial assistance set out in Article 7. The amount of financial assistance to be granted to the blending operations supported by means of a CEF blending facility shall be modulated on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, the availability of Union budget resources and the need to maximise the leverage of Union funding. No grant awarded shall exceed the funding rates laid down in Article 10.
6.   The Commission shall, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB), study the possibility for the EIB to systematically provide first loss guarantees within CEF blending facilities in order to allow and facilitate additionality and the participation of private co-investors in the transport sector.
7.   The Union, Member States and other investors may contribute to CEF blending facilities, provided that the Commission agrees to the specifications of the eligibility criteria of blending operations and/or the investment strategy of the CEF blending facility which may be necessary due to the additional contribution and in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation when carrying out projects of common interest. Those additional resources shall be implemented by the Commission in accordance with Article 6(3).
8.   Blending operations supported by means of a CEF blending facility shall be selected on the basis of maturity and shall seek sectoral diversification in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 as well as geographical balance across the Member States. They shall:
(a)
represent European added value;
(b)
respond to the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy;
(c)
contribute, where possible, to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
9.   CEF blending facilities shall be made available and blending operations shall be selected based on the selection and award criteria established in the multiannual and the annual work programmes adopted pursuant to Article 17.
10.   Blending operations in third countries may be supported by means of a CEF blending facility if those actions are necessary for the implementation of a project of common interest.
