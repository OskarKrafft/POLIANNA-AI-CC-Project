Article 279
Transitional provisions
1.   Legal commitments for grants implementing the budget under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 may continue to take the form of grant decisions. The provisions of Title VIII applicable to grant agreements shall apply mutatis mutandis to grant decisions. The Commission shall review the use of grant decisions under the post-2020 multiannual financial framework, in particular in view of the progress made in electronic signature and electronic management of grants by that time.
2.   Upon entry into force of this Regulation Commission decisions authorising the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates adopted in accordance with Article 124 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 shall be amended by the authorising officer responsible in accordance with Article 181 of this Regulation.
3.   Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 and Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 shall continue to apply to legal commitments entered into before the entry into force of this Regulation. The existing pillar assessments, contribution agreement templates and financial framework partnership agreements may continue to apply and shall be reviewed as appropriate.
4.   For financial contributions from the EGF including support to NEETs, for which the period specified in Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 has not expired by 1 January 2018, the Commission shall assess whether personalised services provided to NEETs are eligible for co-financing by the EGF beyond 31 December 2017. Where the Commission concludes that this is the case, it shall amend the affected decisions on the financial contribution accordingly.
