it is reasonably ensured that any attempt to infringe any of the conditions set out in points (a) to (d) can be detected.
The first subparagraph shall not apply to contracts below the thresholds referred to in Article 175(1).
4.   Where the authorising officer responsible authorises submission of application documents by electronic means, the electronic documents submitted by means of such systems shall be deemed to be the originals.
5.   Where submission is by letter, participants may choose to submit application documents:
(a)
either by post or by courier service, in which case the evidence shall be constituted by the postmark or the date of the deposit slip;

by hand-delivery to the premises of the authorising officer responsible by the participant in person or by an agent, in which case the evidence shall be constituted by the acknowledgement of receipt.
6.   By submitting application documents, participants accept to receive notification of the outcome of the procedure by electronic means.
