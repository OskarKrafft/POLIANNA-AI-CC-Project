Article 160
Principles applicable to contracts and scope
1.   All contracts financed in whole or in part by the budget shall respect the principles of transparency, proportionality, equal treatment and non-discrimination.
2.   All contracts shall be put out to competition on the broadest possible basis, except when use is made of the procedure referred to in point (d) of Article 164(1).
The estimated value of a contract shall not be determined with a view to circumventing the applicable rules, nor shall a contract be split up for that purpose.
The contracting authority shall divide a contract into lots, whenever appropriate, with due regard to broad competition.
3.   Contracting authorities shall not use framework contracts improperly or in such a way that their purpose or effect is to prevent, restrict or distort competition.
4.   The JRC may receive funding charged to appropriations other than research and technological development appropriations in respect of its participation in procurement procedures financed in whole or in part from the budget.
5.   The rules on procurement laid down in this Regulation shall not apply to the activities of the JRC on behalf of third parties, with the exception of the principles of transparency and equal treatment.
