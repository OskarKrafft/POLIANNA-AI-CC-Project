(a)
a contract notice to launch a procedure, except in the case of the procedure referred to in point (d) of Article 164(1);
(b)
a contract award notice on the results of the procedure.
2.   Procedures with a value below the thresholds referred to in Article 175(1) or Article 178 shall be advertised by appropriate means.
