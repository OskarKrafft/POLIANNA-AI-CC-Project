Article 30
Transfers by the Commission
1.   The Commission may, within its own section of the budget, autonomously:
(a)
transfer appropriations within each chapter;
(b)
with regard to expenditure on staff and administration which is common to several titles, transfer appropriations from one title to another up to a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget line from which the transfer is made, and up to a maximum of 30 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget line to which the transfer is made;
(c)
with regard to operational expenditure, transfer appropriations between chapters within the same title up to a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget line from which the transfer is made;
(d)
with regard to research and technological development appropriations implemented by the JRC, within the title of the budget relating to the ‘Direct research’ policy area, transfer appropriations between chapters of up to a maximum of 15 % of the appropriations on the budget line from which the transfer is made;
(e)
with regard to research and technological development, transfer operational appropriations from one title to another, provided that the appropriations are used for the same purpose;
(f)
with regard to operational expenditure of the funds implemented under shared management, with the exception of the EAGF, transfer appropriations from one title to another, provided that the appropriations concerned are for the same objective within the meaning of the Regulation establishing the fund concerned or constitute technical assistance expenditure;
(g)
transfer appropriations from the budgetary item of a budgetary guarantee to the budgetary item of another budgetary guarantee, in the exceptional cases when the provisioned resources in the common provisioning fund of the latter are insufficient to pay a guarantee call and subject to the subsequent restoring of the amount transferred in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 212(4).
The expenditure referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall cover, for each policy area, the items referred to in Article 47(4).
Where the Commission transfers EAGF appropriations pursuant to the first subparagraph after 31 December, it shall take its decision by 31 January of the following financial year. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council within two weeks after its decision on those transfers.
Three weeks before making the transfers referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of its intention to do so. In the event that duly justified objections are raised within that period by the European Parliament or by the Council, the procedure laid down in Article 31 shall apply.
By way of derogation from the fourth subparagraph, the Commission may, during the last two months of the financial year, autonomously transfer appropriations concerning expenditure on staff, external personnel and other agents from one title to another within the total limit of 5 % of the appropriations for that year. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council within two weeks after its decision on those transfers.
2.   The Commission may, within its own section of the budget, decide on the following transfers of appropriations from one title to another, provided it immediately informs the European Parliament and the Council of its decision:
(a)
transfer of appropriations from the ‘provisions’ title referred to in Article 49 of this Regulation, where the only condition for lifting the reserve is the adoption of a basic act pursuant to Article 294 TFEU;
(b)
in duly justified exceptional cases such as international humanitarian disasters and crises occurring after 1 December of the financial year, transfer of unused appropriations for that year still available in the titles falling under the heading of the multiannual financial framework dedicated to Union external action to the titles concerning crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations.
