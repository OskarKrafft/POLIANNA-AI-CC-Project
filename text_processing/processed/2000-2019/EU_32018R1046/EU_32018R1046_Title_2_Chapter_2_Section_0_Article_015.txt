Article 15
Making appropriations corresponding to decommitments available again
1.   The appropriations corresponding to decommitments referred to in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 223/2014 and (EU) No 514/2014 may be made available again in the event of a manifest error attributable solely to the Commission.
To that end, the Commission shall examine decommitments made during the preceding financial year and shall decide, by 15 February of the current financial year, on the basis of requirements, whether it is necessary to make the corresponding appropriations available again.
2.   In addition to the case referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the appropriations corresponding to decommitments shall be made available again in the event of:
(a)
the decommitment from a programme under the arrangements for the implementation of the performance reserve established in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013;
(b)
the decommitment from a programme dedicated to a specific financial instrument in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) following the discontinuance of the participation of a Member State in the financial instrument, as referred to in the seventh subparagraph of Article 39(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013.
3.   Commitment appropriations corresponding to the amount of decommitments made as a result of total or partial non-implementation of corresponding research projects may also be made available again to the benefit of the research programme the projects belong to or its successor in the context of the budgetary procedure.
