Article 141
Rejection from an award procedure
1.   The authorising officer responsible shall reject from an award procedure a participant who:
(a)
is in an exclusion situation established in accordance with Article 136;
(b)
has misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in the procedure or has failed to supply that information;
(c)
was previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award procedure where this entails a breach of the principle of equality of treatment, including distortion of competition, that cannot be remedied otherwise.
The authorising officer responsible shall communicate to the other participants in the award procedure the relevant information exchanged in the context of or resulting from the involvement of the participant in the preparation of the award procedure as referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph. Prior to any such rejection the participant shall be given the opportunity to prove that its involvement in preparing the award procedure does not breach the principle of equality of treatment.
2.   Article 133(1) shall apply unless the rejection has been justified in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article by a decision concerning exclusion taken with regard to the participant, following an examination of its observations.
