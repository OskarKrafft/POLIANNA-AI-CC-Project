Article 59
Budget implementation by Union institutions other than the Commission
1.   The Commission shall confer on the other Union institutions the requisite powers for the implementation of the sections of the budget relating to them.
2.   In order to facilitate the implementation of their appropriations, Union institutions may conclude service-level agreements with each other laying down the conditions governing the provision of services, supply of products, execution of works or of building contracts.
Those agreements shall enable the transfer of appropriations or the recovery of costs, which result from their implementation.
3.   Service-level agreements referred to in paragraph 2 may also be agreed upon between departments of Union institutions, Union bodies, European offices, bodies or persons entrusted with implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and the Office of the Secretary-General of the Board of Governors of the European schools. The Commission and other Union institutions shall report regularly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the service-level agreements they conclude with other Union institutions.
