(b)
reliability of reporting;
(c)
safeguarding of assets and information;
(d)
prevention, detection, correction and follow-up of fraud and irregularities;
(e)
adequate management of the risks relating to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, taking into account the multiannual character of programmes as well as the nature of the payments concerned.
3.   Effective internal control shall be based on best international practices and include, in particular, the following elements:
(a)
segregation of tasks;
(b)
an appropriate risk management and control strategy that includes control at recipient level;

avoidance of conflict of interests;
(d)
adequate audit trails and data integrity in data systems;
(e)
procedures for monitoring effectiveness and efficiency;
(f)
procedures for follow-up of identified internal control weaknesses and exceptions;
(g)
periodic assessment of the sound functioning of the internal control system.
4.   Efficient internal control shall be based on the following elements:
(a)
the implementation of an appropriate risk management and control strategy coordinated among appropriate actors involved in the control chain;
(b)
the accessibility for all appropriate actors in the control chain of the results of controls carried out;
(c)
reliance, where appropriate, on management declarations of implementation partners and on independent audit opinions, provided that the quality of the underlying work is adequate and acceptable and that it was performed in accordance with agreed standards;
(d)
the timely application of corrective measures including, where appropriate, dissuasive penalties;
(e)
clear and unambiguous legislation underlying the policies concerned, including basic acts on the elements of the internal control;
(f)
the elimination of multiple controls;
(g)
the improvement of the cost benefit ratio of controls.
5.   If, during implementation, the level of error is persistently high, the Commission shall identify the weaknesses in the control systems, analyse the costs and benefits of possible corrective measures and take or propose appropriate action, such as simplification of the applicable provisions, improvement of the control systems and redesign of the programme or delivery systems.
