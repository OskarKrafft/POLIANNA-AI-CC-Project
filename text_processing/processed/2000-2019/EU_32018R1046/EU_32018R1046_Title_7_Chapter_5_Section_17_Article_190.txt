Article 190
Co-financing
1.   Grants shall involve co-financing. As a result, the resources necessary to carry out the action or the work programme shall not be provided entirely by the grant.
Co-financing may be provided in the form of the beneficiary’s own resources, income generated by the action or work programme or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties.
2.   In-kind contributions from third parties in the form of volunteers’ work valued in accordance with Article 181(8) shall be presented as eligible costs in the estimated budget. They shall be presented separately from other eligible costs. Volunteers’ work may comprise up to 50 % of the co-financing. For the purposes of calculating that percentage, in-kind contributions and other co-financing shall be based on the estimates provided by the applicant.
Other in-kind contributions from third parties shall be presented separately from the contributions to the eligible costs in the estimated budget. Their approximate value shall be indicated in the estimated budget and shall not be subject to subsequent changes.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, an external action may be financed in full by the grant where this is essential for it to be carried out. In such a case, justification shall be provided in the award decision.
4.   This Article shall not apply to interest rate rebates and guarantee fee subsidies.
