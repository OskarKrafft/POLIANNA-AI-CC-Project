Article 7
Activities of an IORP
Member States shall require IORPs registered or authorised within their territories to limit their activities to retirement-benefit related operations and activities arising therefrom.
When, in accordance with Article 4, a life insurance undertaking manages its occupational retirement provision business by ring-fencing its assets and liabilities, the ring-fenced assets and liabilities shall be restricted to retirement-benefit related operations and activities directly arising therefrom.
As a general principle, IORPs shall, where relevant, have regard to the aim of having an equitable spread of risks and benefits between generations in their activities.
