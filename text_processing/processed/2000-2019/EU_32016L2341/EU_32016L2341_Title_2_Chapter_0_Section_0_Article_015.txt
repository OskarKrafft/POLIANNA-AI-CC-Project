Article 15
Regulatory own funds
1.   The home Member State shall ensure that IORPs operating pension schemes, where the IORP itself, and not the sponsoring undertaking, underwrites the liability to cover against biometric risk, or guarantees a given investment performance or a given level of benefits, hold on a permanent basis additional assets above the technical provisions to serve as a buffer. The amount thereof shall reflect the type of risk and the portfolio of assets in respect of the total range of schemes operated. Those assets shall be free of all foreseeable liabilities and serve as a safety capital to absorb discrepancies between the anticipated and the actual expenses and profits.
2.   For the purposes of calculating the minimum amount of additional assets, the rules laid down in Articles 16, 17 and 18 shall apply.
3.   Paragraph 1 shall, however, not prevent Member States from requiring IORPs located in their territory to hold regulatory own funds or from laying down more detailed rules provided that they are prudentially justified.
