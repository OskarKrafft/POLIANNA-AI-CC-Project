Article 30
Statement of investment policy principles
Member States shall ensure that every IORP registered or authorised in their territories prepares and, at least every three years, reviews a written statement of investment-policy principles. That statement is to be revised without delay after any significant change in the investment policy. Member States shall provide for this statement to contain, at least, such matters as the investment risk measurement methods, the risk-management processes implemented and the strategic asset allocation with respect to the nature and duration of pension liabilities and how the investment policy takes environmental, social and governance factors into account. The statement shall be made publicly available.
