Article 3
Application to IORPs operating social security schemes
IORPs which also operate compulsory employment-related pension schemes which are considered to be social security schemes covered by Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and (EC) No 987/2009 shall be covered by this Directive in respect of their non-compulsory occupational retirement provision business.
