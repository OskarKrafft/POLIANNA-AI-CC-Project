Article 16
Available solvency margin
1.   Member States shall require of every IORP referred to in Article 15(1) which is registered or authorised in their territories an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business at all times which is at least equal to the requirements in this Directive in order to ensure long-term sustainability of occupational retirement provision.
2.   The available solvency margin shall consist of the assets of the IORP free of any foreseeable liabilities, less any intangible items, including:
(a)
the paid-up share capital or, in the case of an IORP taking the form of a mutual undertaking, the effective initial fund plus any accounts of the members of the mutual undertaking which fulfil the following criteria:
(i)
the memorandum and articles of association must stipulate that payments may be made from those accounts to members of the mutual undertaking only insofar as this does not cause the available solvency margin to fall below the required level or, after the dissolution of the undertaking, where all the undertaking's other debts have been settled;
(ii)
the memorandum and articles of association must stipulate, with respect to any payments referred to in point (i) for reasons other than the individual termination of membership in the mutual undertaking, that the competent authorities must be notified at least one month in advance and can prohibit the payment within that period; and
(iii)
the relevant provisions of the memorandum and articles of association may be amended only after the competent authorities have declared that they have no objection to the amendment, without prejudice to the criteria referred to in points (i) and (ii);
(b)
reserves (statutory and free) not corresponding to underwriting liabilities;
(c)
the profit or loss brought forward after deduction of dividends to be paid; and
(d)
insofar as authorised under national law, profit reserves appearing in the balance sheet where they may be used to cover any losses which may arise and where they have not been made available for distribution to members and beneficiaries.
The available solvency margin shall be reduced by the amount of own shares directly held by the IORP.
3.   Member States may provide that the available solvency margin may also comprise:
(a)
cumulative preferential share capital and subordinated loan capital up to 50 % of the lesser of the available solvency margin and the required solvency margin, no more than 25 % of which shall consist of subordinated loans with a fixed maturity, or fixed-term cumulative preferential share capital, provided that binding agreements exist under which, in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of the IORP, the subordinated loan capital or preferential share capital ranks after the claims of all other creditors and is not to be repaid until all other debts outstanding at the time have been settled;
(b)
securities with no specified maturity date and other instruments, including cumulative preferential shares other than those referred to in point (a), to a maximum of 50 % of the available solvency margin, or the required solvency margin, whichever the lesser, for the total of such securities, and the subordinated loan capital referred to in point (a), provided they fulfil the following conditions:
(i)
they must not be repaid on the initiative of the bearer or without the prior consent of the competent authority;
(ii)
the contract of issue must enable the IORP to defer the payment of interest on the loan;
(iii)
the lender's claims on the IORP must rank entirely after those of all non-subordinated creditors;
(iv)
the documents governing the issue of the securities must provide for the loss-absorption capacity of the debt and unpaid interest, while enabling the IORP to continue its business; and
(v)
only fully paid-up amounts must be taken into account.
For the purposes of point (a), subordinated loan capital shall also fulfil the following conditions:
(i)
only fully paid-up funds shall be taken into account;
(ii)
for loans with a fixed maturity, the original maturity shall be at least five years. No later than one year before the repayment date, the IORP shall submit to the competent authorities for their approval a plan showing how the available solvency margin will be kept at or brought to the required level at maturity, unless the extent to which the loan may rank as a component of the available solvency margin is gradually reduced during at least the five years before the repayment date. The competent authorities may authorise the early repayment of such loans provided application is made by the issuing IORP and its available solvency margin will not fall below the required level;
(iii)
loans the maturity of which is not fixed shall be repayable only subject to five years' notice unless the loans are no longer considered as a component of the available solvency margin or unless the prior consent of the competent authorities is specifically required for early repayment. In the latter event the IORP shall notify the competent authorities at least six months before the date of the proposed repayment, specifying the available solvency margin and the required solvency margin both before and after that repayment. The competent authorities shall authorise repayment only where the IORP's available solvency margin will not fall below the required level;
(iv)
the loan agreement shall not include any clause providing that in specified circumstances, other than the winding-up of the IORP, the debt will become repayable before the agreed repayment dates; and
(v)
the loan agreement may be amended only after the competent authorities have declared that they have no objection to the amendment.
4.   Upon application, with supporting evidence, by the IORP to the competent authority of the home Member State and with the agreement of that competent authority, the available solvency margin may also comprise:
(a)
where Zillmerising is not practised or where, if practised, it is less than the loading for acquisition costs included in the premium, the difference between a non-Zillmerised or partially Zillmerised mathematical provision and a mathematical provision Zillmerised at a rate equal to the loading for acquisition costs included in the premium;
(b)
any hidden net reserves arising out of the valuation of assets, insofar as such hidden net reserves are not of an exceptional nature;
(c)
one half of the unpaid share capital or initial fund, once the paid-up part amounts to 25 % of that share capital or fund, up to 50 % of the available or required solvency margin, whichever is the lesser.
The figure referred to in point (a) shall not exceed 3,5 % of the sum of the differences between the relevant capital sums of life insurance and occupational retirement provision activities and the mathematical provisions for all policies for which Zillmerising is possible. The difference shall be reduced by the amount of any undepreciated acquisition costs entered as an asset.
