Article 5
Small IORPs and statutory schemes
With the exception of Articles 32 to 35, Member States may choose not to apply this Directive, in whole or in part, to any IORP registered or authorised in their territories which operates pension schemes which together have less than 100 members in total. Subject to Article 2(2), such IORPs shall nevertheless be given the right to apply this Directive on a voluntary basis. Article 11 may be applied only if all the other provisions of this Directive apply. Member States shall apply Article 19(1) and Article 21(1) and (2) to any IORP registered or authorised in their territories which operates pension schemes which together have more than 15 members in total.
Member States may choose to apply any of Articles 1 to 8, Article 19 and Articles 32 to 35 to institutions where occupational retirement provision is made under statute, pursuant to national law, and is guaranteed by a public authority.
