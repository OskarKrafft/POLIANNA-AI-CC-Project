Article 52
Professional secrecy
1.   Member States shall lay down rules to ensure that all persons who are working or who have worked for the competent authorities, as well as auditors and experts acting on behalf of those authorities, are bound by the obligation of professional secrecy. Without prejudice to cases covered by criminal law, those persons shall not divulge confidential information received by them in the course of their duties to any person or authority, except in summary or aggregate form ensuring that individual IORPs cannot be identified.
2.   By derogation from paragraph 1, where a pension scheme is being wound up, Member States may allow confidential information to be divulged in civil or commercial proceedings.
