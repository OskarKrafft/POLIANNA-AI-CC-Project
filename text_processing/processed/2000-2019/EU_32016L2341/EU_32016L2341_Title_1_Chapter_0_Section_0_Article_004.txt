Article 4
Optional application to institutions covered by Directive 2009/138/EC
Home Member States may choose to apply the provisions of Articles 9 to 14, Articles 19 to 22, Article 23(1) and (2), and Articles 24 to 58 of this Directive to the occupational retirement provision business of life insurance undertakings in accordance with points (a)(i) to (iii) of Article 2(3) and points (b)(ii) to (iv) of Article 2(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC. In that case, all assets and liabilities corresponding to the occupational retirement provision business shall be ring-fenced, managed and organised separately from the other activities of the life insurance undertakings, without any possibility of transfer.
In the case referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, and only insofar as their occupational retirement provision business is concerned, life insurance undertakings shall not be subject to Articles 76 to 86, Article 132, Article 134(2), Article 173, Article 185(5), Article 185(7) and (8) and Article 209 of Directive 2009/138/EC.
The home Member State shall ensure that either the competent authorities, or the authorities responsible for supervision of life insurance undertakings covered by Directive 2009/138/EC, as part of their supervisory work, verify the strict separation of the relevant occupational retirement provision business.
