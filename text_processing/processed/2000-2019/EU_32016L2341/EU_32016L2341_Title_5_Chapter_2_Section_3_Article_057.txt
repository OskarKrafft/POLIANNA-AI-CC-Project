Article 57
Disclosure of information to government administrations responsible for financial legislation
1.   Articles 52(1), 53 and 58(1) shall not preclude Member States from authorising the disclosure of confidential information between competent authorities and other departments of their central government administrations responsible for the enforcement of legislation on the supervision of IORPs, credit institutions, financial institutions, investment services and insurance undertakings, or inspectors acting on behalf of those departments.
That disclosure shall be made only where necessary for reasons of prudential control, and prevention and resolution of failing IORPs. Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, persons having access to the information shall be subject to professional secrecy requirements at least equivalent to those set out in this Directive. Member States shall, however, provide the information received under Article 55, and information obtained by means of on-site verification may only be disclosed with the express consent of the competent authority from which the information originated or of the competent authority of the Member State in which the on-site verification was carried out.
2.   Member States may authorise the disclosure of confidential information relating to the prudential supervision of IORPs to parliamentary enquiry committees or courts of auditors in their Member State and other entities in charge of enquiries in their Member State, where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the entities have the competence under national law to investigate or scrutinise the actions of authorities responsible for the supervision of IORPs or for laws on such supervision;
(b)
the information is strictly necessary for fulfilling the competence referred to in point (a);
(c)
the persons with access to the information are subject to professional secrecy requirements under national law at least equivalent to those set out in this Directive;
(d)
if the information originates from another Member State, that information is disclosed with the explicit agreement of the originating competent authorities and solely for the purposes for which those authorities gave their agreement.
