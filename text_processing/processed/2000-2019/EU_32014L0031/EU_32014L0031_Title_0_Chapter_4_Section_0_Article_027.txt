Article 27
Notification procedure
1.   Notifying authorities may notify only conformity assessment bodies which have satisfied the requirements laid down in Article 23.
2.   They shall notify the Commission and the other Member States using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.
3.   The notification shall include full details of the conformity assessment activities, the conformity assessment module or modules and instrument or instruments concerned and the relevant attestation of competence.
4.   Where a notification is not based on an accreditation certificate as referred to in Article 26(2), the notifying authority shall provide the Commission and the other Member States with documentary evidence which attests to the conformity assessment body’s competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that that body will be monitored regularly and will continue to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 23.
5.   The body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body only where no objections are raised by the Commission or the other Member States within two weeks of a notification where an accreditation certificate is used or within two months of a notification where accreditation is not used.
Only such a body shall be considered a notified body for the purposes of this Directive.
6.   The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any subsequent relevant changes to the notification.
