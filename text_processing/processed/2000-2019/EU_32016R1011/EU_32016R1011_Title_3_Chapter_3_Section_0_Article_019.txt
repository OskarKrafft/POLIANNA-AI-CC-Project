Article 19
Commodity benchmarks
1.   The specific requirements laid down in Annex II shall apply instead of the requirements of Title II, with the exception of Article 10, to the provision of, and contribution to, commodity benchmarks, unless the benchmark in question is a regulated-data benchmark or is based on submissions by contributors the majority of which are supervised entities.
Articles 24, 25 and 26 shall not apply to the provision of, and contribution to, commodity benchmarks.
2.   Where a commodity benchmark is a critical benchmark and the underlying asset is gold, silver or platinum, the requirements of Title II shall apply instead of Annex II.
