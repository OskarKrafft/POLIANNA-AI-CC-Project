1.   ESMA shall seek to build a common European supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices and ensure consistent approaches among competent authorities in relation to the application of Articles 32 and 33. To that end, the recognitions granted in accordance with Article 32 and the endorsements authorised in accordance with Article 33 shall be reviewed by ESMA every two years.
ESMA shall issue an opinion to each competent authority that has recognised a third country administrator or endorsed a third country benchmark assessing how that competent authority applies the relevant requirements of Articles 32 and 33 respectively and the requirements of any relevant delegated act and regulatory or implementing technical standard based on this Regulation.
2.   ESMA shall have the power to require the documented evidence from a competent authority for any of the decisions adopted in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 51(2), Article 24(1) and Article 25(2).
