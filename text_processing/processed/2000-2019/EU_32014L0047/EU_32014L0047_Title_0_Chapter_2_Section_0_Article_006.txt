Article 6
Risk rating system
For vehicles referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2(1), Member States shall ensure that the information concerning the number and severity of deficiencies set out in Annex II and, where applicable, Annex III found on vehicles operated by individual undertakings is introduced into the risk rating system established under Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC. For the attribution of a risk profile to an undertaking, Member States may use the criteria set out in Annex I. That information shall be used to check undertakings with a high risk rating more closely and more often. The risk rating system shall be operated by the competent authorities of the Member States.
For the purpose of implementing the first subparagraph, the Member State of registration shall use the information received from other Member States pursuant to Article 18(1).
Member States may allow additional voluntary roadworthiness tests. Information on compliance with roadworthiness requirements obtained from voluntary tests may be taken into account in order to improve the risk profile of an undertaking.
