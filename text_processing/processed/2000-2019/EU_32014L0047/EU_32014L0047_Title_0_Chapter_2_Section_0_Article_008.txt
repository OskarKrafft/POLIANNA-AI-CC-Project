Article 8
Inspectors
1.   When selecting a vehicle for a technical roadside inspection and when carrying out that inspection, inspectors shall refrain from any discrimination on grounds of the nationality of the driver or of the country of registration or entry into service of the vehicle.
2.   When carrying out a technical roadside inspection, the inspector shall be free from any conflict of interest that could have any influence on the impartiality and objectivity of his decision.
3.   The reward of inspectors shall not be directly related to the results of initial or more detailed technical roadside inspections.
4.   More detailed technical roadside inspections shall be carried out by inspectors who fulfil the minimum competence and training requirements laid down in Article 13 and in Annex IV to Directive 2014/45/EU. Member States may provide that inspectors carrying out inspections in designated roadside inspection facilities or using mobile inspection units are to fulfil those requirements or equivalent requirements approved by the competent authority.
