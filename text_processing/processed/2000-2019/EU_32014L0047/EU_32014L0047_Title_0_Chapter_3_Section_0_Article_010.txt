Article 10
Contents and methods of technical roadside inspections
1.   Member States shall ensure that vehicles selected in accordance with Article 9 are subject to an initial technical roadside inspection.
In each initial technical roadside inspection of a vehicle, the inspector:
(a)
shall check the latest roadworthiness certificate and technical roadside inspection report, where available, kept on board, or electronic evidence thereof in accordance with Article 7(1);
(b)
shall carry out a visual assessment of the technical condition of the vehicle;
(c)
may carry out a visual assessment of the securing of the vehicle’s cargo in accordance with Article 13;
(d)
may carry out technical checks by any method deemed appropriate. Such technical checks may be carried out in order to substantiate a decision to submit the vehicle to a more detailed technical roadside inspection, or to request that the deficiencies be rectified without delay in accordance with Article 14(1).
The inspector shall verify whether any deficiencies indicated in the previous technical roadside inspection report have been rectified.
2.   On the basis of the outcome of the initial inspection, the inspector shall decide whether the vehicle or its trailer should be subject to a more detailed roadside inspection.
3.   A more detailed technical roadside inspection shall cover those items listed in Annex II that are considered necessary and relevant, taking into account in particular the safety of the brakes, tyres, wheels, chassis and nuisance, and the recommended methods applicable to the testing of those items.
4.   Where the roadworthiness certificate or a roadside inspection report demonstrates that an inspection of one of the items listed in Annex II has been carried out in the course of the preceding three months, the inspector shall not check that item, except where such a check is justified on the grounds of an obvious deficiency.
