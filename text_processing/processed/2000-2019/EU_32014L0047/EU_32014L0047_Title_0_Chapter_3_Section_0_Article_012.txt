Article 12
Assessment of deficiencies
1.   For each item to be inspected, Annex II provides a list of possible deficiencies and their level of severity to be used during technical roadside inspections.
2.   Deficiencies found during technical roadside inspections of vehicles shall be categorised in one of the following groups:
(a)
minor deficiencies having no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or impact on the environment, and other minor non-compliances,
(b)
major deficiencies that may prejudice the safety of the vehicle or have an impact on the environment or put other road users at risk, or other more significant non-compliances;
(c)
dangerous deficiencies constituting a direct and immediate risk to road safety or having an impact on the environment.
3.   A vehicle having deficiencies falling into more than one of the deficiency groups referred to in paragraph 2 shall be classified in the group corresponding to the more serious deficiency. A vehicle showing several deficiencies within the same inspection areas as defined in the scope of the technical roadside inspection referred to in point 1 of Annex II may be classified in the next most serious deficiency group if it is considered that the combined effect of those deficiencies results in a higher risk to road safety.
