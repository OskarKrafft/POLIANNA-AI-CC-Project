Article 9
Selection of vehicles for initial technical roadside inspection
When identifying vehicles to be subject to an initial technical roadside inspection, inspectors may select, as a priority, vehicles operated by undertakings with a high-risk profile as referred to in Directive 2006/22/EC. Vehicles may also be selected randomly for inspection, or where there is a suspicion that the vehicle presents a risk to road safety or to the environment.
