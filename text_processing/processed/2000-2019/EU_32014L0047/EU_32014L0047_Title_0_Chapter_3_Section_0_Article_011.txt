Inspection facilities
1.   A more detailed technical roadside inspection shall be carried out using a mobile inspection unit or a designated roadside inspection facility, or in a testing centre as referred to in Directive 2014/45/EU.
2.   Where a more detailed inspection is to be carried out in a testing centre or designated roadside inspection facility, it shall be carried out as soon as possible in one of the closest practicable centres or facilities.
3.   Mobile inspection units and designated roadside inspection facilities shall include appropriate equipment for carrying out a more detailed technical roadside inspection, including the equipment necessary to assess the condition of the brakes and brake efficiency, steering, suspension and nuisance of the vehicle as required. Where mobile inspection units or designated roadside inspection facilities do not include the equipment required to check an item indicated in an initial inspection, the vehicle shall be directed to a testing centre or facility where a detailed check of that item can be performed.
