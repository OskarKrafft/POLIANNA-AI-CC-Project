Article 13
Inspection of cargo securing
1.   During a roadside inspection a vehicle may be subject to an inspection of its cargo securing in accordance with Annex III, in order to ensure that the cargo is secured in such a way that it does not interfere with safe driving, or pose a threat to life, health, property or the environment. Checks may be carried out to verify that during all kinds of operation of the vehicle, including emergency situations or uphill starting manoeuvres:
—
loads can only minimally change their position relative to each other, against walls or surfaces of the vehicle, and
—
loads cannot leave the cargo space or move outside the loading surface.
2.   Without prejudice to the requirements applicable to transport of certain categories of goods, such as those covered by the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) (13), cargo securing and inspection of the securing of cargo may be carried out in accordance with the principles and, where appropriate, the standards laid down in Section I of Annex III. The latest version of the standards laid down in point 5 of Section I of Annex III may be used.
3.   The follow-up procedures referred to in Article 14 may also apply in the case of major or dangerous deficiencies related to cargo securing.
4.   Member States shall provide that personnel involved in cargo securing checks are to be appropriately trained for that purpose.
