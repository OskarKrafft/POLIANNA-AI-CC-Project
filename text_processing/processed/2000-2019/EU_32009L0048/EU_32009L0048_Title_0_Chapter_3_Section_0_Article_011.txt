Article 11
Warnings
1.   Where appropriate for safe use, warnings made for the purposes of Article 10(2) shall specify appropriate user limitations in accordance with Part A of Annex V.
As regards the categories of toy listed in Part B of Annex V, the warnings set out therein shall be used. The warnings set out in points 2 to 10 of Part B of Annex V shall be used as worded therein.
Toys shall not bear one or more of the specific warnings set out in Part B of Annex V where that warning conflicts with the intended use of the toy, as determined by virtue of its function, dimension and characteristics.
2.   The manufacturer shall mark the warnings in a clearly visible, easily legible and understandable and accurate manner on the toy, on an affixed label or on the packaging and, if appropriate, on the instructions for use which accompany the toy. Small toys which are sold without packaging shall have appropriate warnings affixed to them.
The warnings shall be preceded by the words ‘Warning’ or ‘Warnings’, as the case may be.
Warnings which determine the decision to purchase the toy, such as those specifying the minimum and maximum ages for users and the other applicable warnings set out in Annex V, shall appear on the consumer packaging or be otherwise clearly visible to the consumer before the purchase, including in cases where the purchase is made on-line.
3.   In accordance with Article 4(7), a Member State may, within its territory, stipulate that those warnings and the safety instructions shall be written in a language or languages easily understood by consumers, as determined by that Member State.
