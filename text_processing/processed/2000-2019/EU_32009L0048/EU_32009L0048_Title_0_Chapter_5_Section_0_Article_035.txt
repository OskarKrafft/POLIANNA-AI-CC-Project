Article 35
Operational obligations of notified bodies
1.   Notified bodies shall carry out conformity assessments in accordance with the conformity assessment procedure provided for in Article 20.
2.   Conformity assessments shall be carried out in a proportionate manner, avoiding unnecessary burdens for economic operators. Conformity assessment bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the technology of the toy in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.
In so doing, they shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for the compliance of the toy with this Directive.
3.   Where a notified body finds that the requirements set out in Article 10 and Annex II or in corresponding harmonised standards have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall require that manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall not issue the EC-type examination certificate as referred to in Article 20(4).
4.   Where, in the course of the monitoring of conformity following the issue of a EC-type examination certificate, a notified body finds that a toy is no longer in compliance, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures, and shall suspend or withdraw the EC-type examination certificate if necessary.
5.   Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any EC-type examination certificates, as appropriate.
