Article 10
Essential safety requirements
1.   Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that toys may not be placed on the market unless they comply with the essential safety requirements set out, as far as the general safety requirement is concerned, in paragraph 2, and, as far as the particular safety requirements are concerned, in Annex II.
2.   Toys, including the chemicals they contain, shall not jeopardise the safety or health of users or third parties when they are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the behaviour of children.
The ability of the users and, where appropriate, their supervisors shall be taken into account, in particular, in the case of toys which are intended for use by children under 36 months or by other specified age groups.
Labels affixed in accordance with Article 11(2) and instructions for use which accompany toys shall draw the attention of users or their supervisors to the inherent hazards and risks of harm involved in using the toys, and to the ways of avoiding such hazards and risks.
3.   Toys placed on the market shall comply with the essential safety requirements during their foreseeable and normal period of use.
