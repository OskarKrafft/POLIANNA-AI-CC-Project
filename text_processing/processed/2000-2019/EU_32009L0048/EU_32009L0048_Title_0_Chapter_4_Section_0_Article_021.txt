Article 21
Technical documentation
1.   The technical documentation referred to in Article 4(2) shall contain all relevant data or details of the means used by the manufacturer to ensure that toys comply with the requirements set out in Article 10 and Annex II. It shall, in particular, contain the documents listed in Annex IV.
2.   The technical documentation shall be drawn up in one of the official languages of the Community, subject to the requirement set out in Article 20(5).
3.   Following a reasoned request from the market surveillance authority of a Member State, the manufacturer shall provide a translation of the relevant parts of the technical documentation into the language of that Member State.
When a market surveillance authority requests the technical documentation or a translation of parts thereof from a manufacturer, it may fix a deadline for receipt of such file or translation, which shall be 30 days, unless a shorter deadline is justified in the case of serious and immediate risk.
4.   If the manufacturer does not comply with the requirements of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the market surveillance authority may require it to have a test performed by a notified body at its own expense within a specified period in order to verify compliance with the harmonised standards and essential safety requirements.
