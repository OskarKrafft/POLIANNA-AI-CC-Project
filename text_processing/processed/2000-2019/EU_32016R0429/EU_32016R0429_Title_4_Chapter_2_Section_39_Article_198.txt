Article 198
Derogations by Member States concerning the obligation of operators for movement of aquaculture animals between Member States, zones or compartments which are subject to an eradication programme
By way of derogation from Article 197(1) and (2), Member States may authorise operators to move aquaculture animals into a zone or compartment for which an eradication programme has been established in accordance with Article 31(1) and (2) as regards the listed diseases referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 9(1), from another zone or compartment for which such a programme has also been established for the same listed diseases, provided that such movement will not jeopardise the health status of the Member State, zone or compartment of destination.
If such movements are to be made to another Member State, the competent authority shall only authorise them if the competent authorities of the Member State of destination and, where relevant, of the Member States of passage, have given their consent to them.
