Article 209
Obligation of operators to ensure that other aquatic animals are accompanied by an animal health certificate and implementing power
1.   In cases where, due to the risk involved with the movement of aquatic animals other than aquaculture animals, animal health certification is required in accordance with the rules provided for in point (a) of Article 211(1), operators shall only move those aquatic animals if the animals in question are accompanied by an animal health certificate issued by the competent authority of the Member State of origin in accordance with Article 216(1).
2.   Article 208 shall also apply to aquatic animals other than aquaculture animals intended for an aquaculture establishment or release into the wild. Where the competent authority of the Member State of origin concludes that certification is not feasible due to the nature of the place of origin of the aquatic animals in question, it may authorise their movement without an animal health certificate subject to the consent of the competent authority of the place of destination.
3.   This Article shall not apply to wild aquatic animals harvested or caught for direct human consumption.
