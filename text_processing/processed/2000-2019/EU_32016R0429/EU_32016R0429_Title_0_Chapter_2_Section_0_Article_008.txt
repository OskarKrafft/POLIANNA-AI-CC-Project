Article 8
Listing of species
1.   The disease-specific rules for listed diseases provided for in this Regulation and the rules adopted pursuant to this Regulation shall apply to listed species.
2.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish a list of species as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article that fulfil the criteria set out in paragraph 3 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 266(2).
That list shall comprise those animal species, or groups of animal species which pose a considerable risk for the spread of specific listed diseases, based on the following criteria:
(a)
the susceptibility of the animal population at risk;
(b)
the duration of the incubation period and infective period for the animals concerned;
(c)
the capability of those animals to carry those specific diseases.
3.   Animal species or groups of animal species shall be added to the list if they are affected or if they pose a risk for the spread of a specific listed disease because:
(a)
they are susceptible to a specific listed disease or scientific evidence indicates that such susceptibility is likely; or
(b)
they are vector species or reservoirs for that disease, or scientific evidence indicates that such role is likely.
4.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, remove animal species or groups of animal species from the list when:
(a)
the relevant listed disease in relation to which the animal species or group of animal species concerned has been listed has been removed from the list of diseases; or
(b)
scientific evidence indicates that the species or group of species concerned no longer fulfils the criteria set out in paragraph 3.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 266(2).
