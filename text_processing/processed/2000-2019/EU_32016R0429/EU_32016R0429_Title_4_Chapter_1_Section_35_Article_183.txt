Article 183
Procedures for the granting of approval by the competent authority
1.   The competent authority shall establish procedures for operators to follow when applying for approval of their establishments in accordance with Article 176(1) and Articles 178 and 179.
2.   Upon receipt of an application for approval from an operator in accordance with Article 176(1), Article 178 or Article 179, the competent authority shall make an on–site visit.
3.   Provided that the requirements referred to in Article 181 are fulfilled, the competent authority shall grant the approval.
4.   Where an establishment does not fulfil all requirements for approval as referred to in Article 181, the competent authority may grant conditional approval of an establishment if it appears, on the basis of the application by the operator concerned and the subsequent on-site visit provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article, that the establishment meets all the main requirements that provide sufficient guarantees that the establishment does not pose a significant risk.
5.   Where conditional approval has been granted by the competent authority in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, it shall grant full approval only where it appears from another on–site visit to the establishment, carried out within three months from the date of the grant of conditional approval, or from documentation provided by the operator within three months from that date, that the establishment meets all the requirements for approval provided for in Article 181(1) and the rules adopted pursuant to Article 181(2).
Where the on–site visit or the documentation referred to in the first subparagraph shows that clear progress has been made but that the establishment still does not meet all of those requirements, the competent authority may prolong the conditional approval. However, conditional approval shall not be granted for a period exceeding, in total, six months.
