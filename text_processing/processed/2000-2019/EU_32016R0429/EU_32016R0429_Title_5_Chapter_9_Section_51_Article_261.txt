suspend the entry into the Union of consignments of animals and products, and means of transport or other material, that may have come into contact with such consignments, which may spread that disease or hazard into the Union;
(b)
establish special requirements for the entry into the Union of animals and products, and of means of transport and other material that may have come into contact with such animals and products, which may spread that disease or hazard into the Union;
(c)
take any other appropriate emergency disease control measures to prevent the spread of such disease or hazard into the Union.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 266(2).
