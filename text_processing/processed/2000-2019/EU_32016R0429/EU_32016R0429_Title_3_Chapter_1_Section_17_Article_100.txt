Article 100
Review, suspension and withdrawal of approvals by the competent authority
1.   The competent authority shall keep approvals of establishments granted in accordance with Articles 97 and 99 under review, at appropriate intervals based on the risk involved.
2.   Where a competent authority identifies serious deficiencies in an establishment as regards compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 97(1) and the rules adopted pursuant to Article 97(2), and the operator of that establishment is not able to provide adequate guarantees that those deficiencies will be eliminated, the competent authority shall initiate procedures to withdraw the approval of the establishment.
However, the competent authority may merely suspend, rather than withdraw, approval of an establishment where the operator can guarantee that it will eliminate those deficiencies within a reasonable period of time.
3.   Approval shall only be granted after withdrawal or restored after suspension in accordance with paragraph 2 when the competent authority is satisfied that the establishment fully complies with all the requirements of this Regulation appropriate for that type of establishment.
