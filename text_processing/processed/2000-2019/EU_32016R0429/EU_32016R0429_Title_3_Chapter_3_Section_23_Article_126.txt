they have not been in contact with kept terrestrial animals which are subject to movement restrictions as referred to in point (b)(ii) and (iii) or kept terrestrial animals of a listed species of a lower health status, for an adequate period of time prior to the date of the intended movement to another Member State, thereby minimising the possibility of spreading disease, taking into account the following matters:
