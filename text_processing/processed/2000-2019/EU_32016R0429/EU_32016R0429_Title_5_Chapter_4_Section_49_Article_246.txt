Maximum number of pet animals
1.   The number of pet animals of the species listed in Part A of Annex I which may be moved during a single non–commercial movement shall not exceed five.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the number of pet animals of the species listed in part A of Annex I may exceed five if the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the non–commercial movement in question is for the purpose of participating in a competition, exhibition or sporting event or training for such an event;
(b)
the pet owner or the authorised person concerned submits written evidence that the pet animals are registered either to attend an event as referred to in point (a), or with an association organising such events;
(c)
the pet animals are more than six months old.
3.   In order to prevent commercial movements of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I from being fraudulently disguised as non–commercial movements, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 264 concerning rules setting the maximum number of pet animals of those species which may be moved during a single non–commercial movement.
