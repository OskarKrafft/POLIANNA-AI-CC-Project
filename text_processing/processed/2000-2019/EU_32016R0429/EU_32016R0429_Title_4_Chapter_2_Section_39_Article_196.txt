Article 196
Abnormal mortalities or other serious disease symptoms
1.   Operators shall only move aquatic animals from an aquaculture establishment or from the wild to another aquaculture establishment, or release them into the wild, if the animals in question:
(a)
show no disease symptoms; and
(b)
originate from an aquaculture establishment or environment where there are no abnormal mortalities with an undetermined cause.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authority may, on the basis of an evaluation of the risks involved, authorise the movement or release of aquatic animals as referred to in that paragraph, provided that the animals in question originate from a part of the aquaculture establishment or from the wild that is independent of the epidemiological unit where the abnormal mortalities or other disease symptoms have occurred.
If the movement or release referred to in this paragraph is to be made to another Member State, it shall only be authorised by the competent authority if the competent authorities of the Member State of destination and, where relevant, of the Member States of passage have given their consent to such movement or release.
