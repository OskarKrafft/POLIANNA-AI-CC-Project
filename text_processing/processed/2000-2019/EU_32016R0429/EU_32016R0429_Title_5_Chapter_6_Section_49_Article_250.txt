1.   In so far as the Commission has adopted a delegated act pursuant to point (b) of Article 252(1) with regard to pet animals of one of the species listed in Part B of Annex I, non–commercial movements of pet animals of that species into a Member State from a third country or territory shall be subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article.
2.   Pet animals of the species referred to in paragraph 1 may be moved into a Member State from a third country or territory only if:

they are identified or described, either individually or in groups, in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to point (a) of Article 252(1);
(b)
they comply with the relevant prevention and risk-mitigation measures adopted pursuant to point (b) of Article 252(1) in relation to listed diseases as referred to in point (d) of Article 9(1);

Each Member State shall draw up a list of those points of entry within its territory and shall make that list available to the public.
3.   Pending the adoption of the relevant delegated acts referred to in paragraph 1, Member States may apply national rules to non–commercial movements of pet animals of the species listed in Part B of Annex I into their territory from a third country or territory, provided that such rules are:
(a)
applied proportionately to the risk to public or animal health associated with non–commercial movements of pet animals of those species; and
