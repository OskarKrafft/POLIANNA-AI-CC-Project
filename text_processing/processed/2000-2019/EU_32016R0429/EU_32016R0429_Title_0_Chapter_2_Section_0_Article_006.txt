Emerging diseases
1.   The rules for the prevention and control of diseases shall apply to emerging diseases as provided for in this Regulation.
2.   A disease other than a listed disease shall be considered to be an emerging disease (‘emerging disease’) provided it has the potential to meet the criteria for listing diseases provided for in Article 5(3) and:
(a)
results from the evolution or change of an existing disease agent;
(b)
is a known disease spreading to a new geographic area, species or population;

is caused by an unrecognised or a previously unrecognised disease agent.
3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, take the necessary measures regarding an emerging disease which fulfils the criteria set out in paragraph 2 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 266(2).
4.   On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to a disease representing an emerging risk having a highly significant impact, the Commission shall adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 266(3).
5.   Any obligation on operators in respect of an emerging disease, as set out in this Regulation, shall only apply if the Commission has adopted an implementing act for that disease in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article or if the disease is covered by a contingency plan in accordance with Article 43.
