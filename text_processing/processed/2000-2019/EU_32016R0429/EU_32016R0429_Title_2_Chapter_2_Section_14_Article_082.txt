Article 82
Disease control measures for listed diseases as referred to in point (c) of Article 9(1) in wild animals
1.   In the event that a competent authority suspects or officially confirms a listed disease as referred to in point (c) of Article 9(1) in wild animals and the affected Member State has opted for the eradication of the disease in question, and provided that measures for wild animals are envisaged in the optional eradication programme provided for in Article 31(2) for that listed disease, the competent authority shall apply the disease control measures laid down in that optional eradication programme throughout the territory of the Member State, area or zone concerned, as relevant for that suspicion or official confirmation.
2.   The competent authority may take disease control measures additional to those provided for in paragraph 1, which may include one or more of the measures laid down in Articles 53 to 69 and shall be proportionate to the risk posed by the listed disease in question and shall take into account:
(a)
the disease profile;
(b)
the affected wild animals and the risk of transmission of diseases to animals and humans; and
(c)
economic, social and environmental impacts.
3.   In the event of an official confirmation of an outbreak of a listed disease as referred to in point (c) of Article 9(1) in wild animals in a Member State, zone or compartment that has obtained disease–free status in accordance with Article 36 or Article 37, and in order to maintain that status, the competent authority shall take one or more of the measures laid down in Articles 53 to 69. Those measures shall be proportionate to the risk posed by the listed disease in question and shall take into account:
(a)
the disease profile;
(b)
the affected wild animals and the risk of transmission of diseases to animals and humans;
(c)
the relevance of the presence of the disease in wild animals in relation to the health status of kept animals; and
