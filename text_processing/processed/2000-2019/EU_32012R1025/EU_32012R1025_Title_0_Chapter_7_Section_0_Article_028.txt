Article 28
Transitional provisions
In Union acts that provide for a presumption of conformity with essential requirements through the application of harmonised standards adopted in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC, references to Directive 98/34/EC shall be construed as references to this Regulation, except references to the committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC regarding technical regulations.
Where a Union act provides for a procedure for objection to harmonised standards, Article 11 of this Regulation shall not apply to that act.
