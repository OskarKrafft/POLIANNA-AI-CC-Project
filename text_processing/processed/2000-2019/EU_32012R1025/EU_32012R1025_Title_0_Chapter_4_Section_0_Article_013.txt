Article 13
Identification of ICT technical specifications eligible for referencing
1.   Either on proposal from a Member State or on its own initiative the Commission may decide to identify ICT technical specifications that are not national, European or international standards, but meet the requirements set out in Annex II, which may be referenced, primarily to enable interoperability, in public procurement.
2.   Either on proposal from a Member State or on its own initiative, when an ICT technical specification identified in accordance with paragraph 1 is modified, withdrawn or no longer meets the requirements set out in Annex II, the Commission may decide to identify the modified ICT technical specification or to withdraw the identification.
3.   The decisions provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be adopted after consultation of the European multi-stakeholder platform on ICT standardisation, which includes European standardisation organisations, Member States and relevant stakeholders, and after consultation of the committee set up by the corresponding Union legislation, if it exists, or after other forms of consultation of sectoral experts, if such a committee does not exist.
