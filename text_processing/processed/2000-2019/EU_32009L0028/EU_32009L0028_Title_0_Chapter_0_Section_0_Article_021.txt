Article 21
Specific provisions related to energy from renewable sources in transport
1.   Member States shall ensure that information is given to the public on the availability and environmental benefits of all different renewable sources of energy for transport. When the percentages of biofuels, blended in mineral oil derivatives, exceed 10 % by volume, Member States shall require this to be indicated at the sales points.
2.   For the purposes of demonstrating compliance with national renewable energy obligations placed on operators and the target for the use of energy from renewable sources in all forms of transport referred to in Article 3(4), the contribution made by biofuels produced from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material shall be considered to be twice that made by other biofuels.
