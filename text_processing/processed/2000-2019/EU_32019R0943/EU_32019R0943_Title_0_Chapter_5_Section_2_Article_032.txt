Article 32
Monitoring by ACER
1.   ACER shall monitor the execution of the tasks of the ENTSO for Electricity referred to in Article 30(1), (2) and (3) and report its findings to the Commission.
ACER shall monitor the implementation by the ENTSO for Electricity of network codes developed under Article 59. Where the ENTSO for Electricity has failed to implement such network codes, ACER shall request the ENTSO for Electricity to provide a duly reasoned explanation as to why it has failed to do so. ACER shall inform the Commission of that explanation and provide its opinion thereon.
ACER shall monitor and analyse the implementation of the network codes and the guidelines adopted by the Commission as laid down in Article 58(1), and their effect on the harmonisation of applicable rules aimed at facilitating market integration as well as on non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market, and report to the Commission.
2.   The ENTSO for Electricity shall submit the draft Union-wide network development plan, the draft annual work programme, including the information regarding the consultation process, and the other documents referred to in Article 30(1) to ACER for its opinion.
Where it considers that the draft annual work programme or the draft Union-wide network development plan submitted by the ENTSO for Electricity does not contribute to non-discrimination, effective competition, the efficient functioning of the market or a sufficient level of cross-border interconnection open to third-party access, ACER shall provide a duly reasoned opinion as well as recommendations to the ENTSO for Electricity and to the Commission within two months of the submission.
