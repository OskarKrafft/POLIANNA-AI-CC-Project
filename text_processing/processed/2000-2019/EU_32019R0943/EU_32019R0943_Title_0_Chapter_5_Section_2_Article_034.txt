Article 34
Regional cooperation of transmission system operators
1.   Transmission system operators shall establish regional cooperation within the ENTSO for Electricity to contribute to the activities referred to in Article 30(1), (2) and (3). In particular, they shall publish a regional investment plan biennially, and may take investment decisions based on that regional investment plan. The ENTSO for Electricity shall promote cooperation between transmission system operators at regional level ensuring interoperability, communication and monitoring of regional performance in those areas which have not yet been harmonised at Union level.
2.   Transmission system operators shall promote operational arrangements in order to ensure the optimum management of the network and shall promote the development of energy exchanges, the coordinated allocation of cross-border capacity through non-discriminatory market-based solutions, paying due attention to the specific merits of implicit auctions for short-term allocations, and the integration of balancing and reserve power mechanisms.
3.   For the purposes of achieving the goals set in paragraphs 1 and 2, the geographical area covered by each regional cooperation structure may be established by the Commission, taking into account existing regional cooperation structures. Each Member State may promote cooperation in more than one geographical area.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 68, supplementing this Regulation, establishing the geographical area covered by each regional cooperation structure. For that purpose, the Commission shall consult the regulatory authorities, ACER and the ENTSO for Electricity.
The delegated acts referred to in this paragraph shall be without prejudice to Article 36.
