Article 50
Provision of information
1.   Transmission system operators shall put in place coordination and information exchange mechanisms to ensure the security of the networks in the context of congestion management.
2.   The safety, operational and planning standards used by transmission system operators shall be made public. The information published shall include a general scheme for the calculation of the total transfer capacity and the transmission reliability margin based upon the electrical and physical features of the network. Such schemes shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authorities.
3.   Transmission system operators shall publish estimates of available transfer capacity for each day, indicating any available transfer capacity already reserved. Those publications shall be made at specified intervals before the day of transport and shall include, in any event, week-ahead and month-ahead estimates, as well as a quantitative indication of the expected reliability of the available capacity.
4.   Transmission system operators shall publish relevant data on aggregated forecast and actual demand, on availability and actual use of generation and load assets, on availability and use of the networks and interconnections, on balancing power and reserve capacity and on the availability of flexibility. For the availability and actual use of small generation and load assets, aggregated estimate data may be used.
5.   The market participants concerned shall provide the transmission system operators with the relevant data.
6.   Generation undertakings which own or operate generation assets, where at least one generation asset has an installed capacity of at least 250 MW, or which have a portfolio comprising at least 400 MW of generation assets, shall keep at the disposal of the regulatory authority, the national competition authority and the Commission, for five years all hourly data per plant that is necessary to verify all operational dispatching decisions and the bidding behaviour at power exchanges, interconnection auctions, reserve markets and over-the-counter-markets. The per-plant and per hour information to be stored shall include, but shall not be limited to, data on available generation capacity and committed reserves, including allocation of those committed reserves on a per-plant level, at the times the bidding is carried out and when production takes place.
7.   Transmission system operators shall exchange regularly a set of sufficiently accurate network and load flow data in order to enable load flow calculations for each transmission system operator in its relevant area. The same set of data shall be made available to the regulatory authorities, and to the Commission and Member States upon request. The regulatory authorities, Member States and the Commission shall treat that set of data confidentially, and shall ensure that confidential treatment is also given by any consultant carrying out analytical work on their request, on the basis of those data.
