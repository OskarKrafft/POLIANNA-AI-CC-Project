Article 58
Adoption of network codes and guidelines
1.   The Commission may, subject to the empowerments in Articles 59, 60 and 61, adopt implementing or delegated acts. Such acts may either be adopted as network codes on the basis of text proposals developed by the ENTSO for Electricity, or, where so provided for in the priority list pursuant to Article 59(3), by the EU DSO entity, where relevant in cooperation with the ENTSO for Electricity, and ACER pursuant to the procedure in Article 59, or as guidelines pursuant to the procedure in Article 61.
2.   The network codes and guidelines shall:
(a)
ensure that they provide the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aims of this Regulation;
(b)
take into account regional specificities, where appropriate;
(c)
not go beyond what is necessary for the purposes of point (a); and
(d)
be without prejudice to the Member States' right to establish national network codes which do not affect cross-zonal trade.
