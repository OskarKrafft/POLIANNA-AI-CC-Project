Article 22
Design principles for capacity mechanisms
1.   Any capacity mechanism shall:
(a)
be temporary;
(b)
not create undue market distortions and not limit cross-zonal trade;
(c)
not go beyond what is necessary to address the adequacy concerns referred to in Article 20;
(d)
select capacity providers by means of a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitive process;
(e)
provide incentives for capacity providers to be available in times of expected system stress;
(f)
ensure that the remuneration is determined through the competitive process;
(g)
set out the technical conditions for the participation of capacity providers in advance of the selection process;
(h)
be open to participation of all resources that are capable of providing the required technical performance, including energy storage and demand side management;
(i)
apply appropriate penalties to capacity providers that are not available in times of system stress.
2.   The design of strategic reserves shall meet the following requirements:
(a)
where a capacity mechanism has been designed as a strategic reserve, the resources thereof are to be dispatched only if the transmission system operators are likely to exhaust their balancing resources to establish an equilibrium between demand and supply;
(b)
during imbalance settlement periods where resources in the strategic reserve are dispatched, imbalances in the market are to be settled at least at the value of lost load or at a higher value than the intraday technical price limit as referred in Article 10(1), whichever is higher;
(c)
the output of the strategic reserve following dispatch is to be attributed to balance responsible parties through the imbalance settlement mechanism;
(d)
the resources taking part in the strategic reserve are not to receive remuneration from the wholesale electricity markets or from the balancing markets;
(e)
the resources in the strategic reserve are to be held outside the market for at least the duration of the contractual period.
The requirement referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the activation of resources before actual dispatch in order to respect the ramping constraints and operating requirements of the resources. The output of the strategic reserve during activation shall not be attributed to balance groups through wholesale markets and shall not change their imbalances.
3.   In addition to the requirements laid down in paragraph 1, capacity mechanisms other than strategic reserves shall:
(a)
be constructed so as to ensure that the price paid for availability automatically tends to zero when the level of capacity supplied is expected to be adequate to meet the level of capacity demanded;
(b)
remunerate the participating resources only for their availability and ensure that the remuneration does not affect decisions of the capacity provider on whether or not to generate;
(c)
ensure that capacity obligations are transferable between eligible capacity providers.
4.   Capacity mechanisms shall incorporate the following requirements regarding CO2 emission limits:
(a)
from 4 July 2019 at the latest, generation capacity that started commercial production on or after that date and that emits more than 550 g of CO2 of fossil fuel origin per kWh of electricity shall not be committed or to receive payments or commitments for future payments under a capacity mechanism;
(b)
from 1 July 2025 at the latest, generation capacity that started commercial production before 4 July 2019 and that emits more than 550 g of CO2 of fossil fuel origin per kWh of electricity and more than 350 kg CO2 of fossil fuel origin on average per year per installed kWe shall not be committed or receive payments or commitments for future payments under a capacity mechanism.
The emission limit of 550 g CO2 of fossil fuel origin per kWh of electricity and the limit of 350 kg CO2 of fossil fuel origin on average per year per installed kWe referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph shall be calculated on the basis of the design efficiency of the generation unit meaning the net efficiency at nominal capacity under the relevant standards provided for by the International Organization for Standardization.
By 5 January 2020, ACER shall publish an opinion providing technical guidance related to the calculation of the values referred in the first subparagraph.
5.   Member States that apply capacity mechanisms on 4 July 2019 shall adapt their mechanisms to comply with Chapter 4 without prejudice to commitments or contracts concluded by 31 December 2019.
