Article 64
Derogations
1.   Member States may apply for derogations from the relevant provisions of Articles 3 and 6, Article 7(1), Article 8(1) and (4), Articles 9, 10 and 11, Articles 14 to 17, Articles 19 to 27, Articles 35 to 47 and Article 51 provided that:
(a)
the Member State can demonstrate that there are substantial problems for the operation of small isolated systems and small connected systems;
(b)
outermost regions within the meaning of Article 349 TFEU cannot be interconnected with the Union's energy market for evident physical reasons.
In the situation referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the derogation shall be limited in time and shall subject to conditions aiming to increase competition and integration with the internal market for electricity.
In the situation referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph, the derogation shall not be limited in time.
The Commission shall inform the Member States of those applications before adopting the decision, protecting the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.
A derogation granted under this Article shall aim to ensure that it does not obstruct the transition towards renewable energy, increased flexibility, energy storage, electromobility and demand response.
In its decision granting a derogation the Commission shall set out to what extent the derogation is to take into account the application of the network codes and guidelines.
2.   Articles 3, 5 and 6, Article 7(1), points (c) and (g) of Article 7(2)) Articles 8 to 17, Article 18(5) and (6), Articles 19 and 20, Article 21(1), (2) and (4) to (8), point (c) of Article 22(1), points (b) and (c) of Article 22(2), the last subparagraph of Article 22 (2), Articles 23 to 27, Article 34(1), (2) and (3), Articles 35 to 47, Article 48(2) and Articles 49 and 51 shall not apply to Cyprus until its transmission system is connected to other Member States' transmission systems via interconnections.
If the transmission system of Cyprus is not connected to other Member States' transmission systems by means of interconnections by 1 January 2026, Cyprus shall assess the need for derogation from those provisions and may submit a request to prolong the derogation to the Commission. The Commission shall assess whether the application of the provisions risks causing substantial problems to the operation of the electricity system in Cyprus or whether their application in Cyprus is expected to provide benefits to the functioning of the market. On the basis of that assessment, the Commission shall issue a reasoned decision to prolong the derogation in full or in part. The decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
3.   This Regulation shall not affect the application of the derogations granted under Article 66 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.
4.   In relation to the attainment of the 2030 interconnection target, as stipulated under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the electricity link between Malta and Italy shall be duly taken into account.
