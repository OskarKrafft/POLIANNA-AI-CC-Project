Article 48
Ten-year network development plan
1.   The Union-wide network development plan referred to under point (b) of Article 30(1) shall include the modelling of the integrated network, scenario development and an assessment of the resilience of the system.
The Union-wide network development plan shall, in particular:
(a)
build on national investment plans, taking into account regional investment plans as referred to in Article 34(1) of this Regulation, and, if appropriate, Union aspects of network planning as set out in Regulation (EU) No 347/2013; it shall be subject to a cost-benefit analysis using the methodology established as set out in Article 11 of that Regulation;
(b)
regarding cross-border interconnections, also build on the reasonable needs of different system users and integrate long-term commitments from investors referred to in Articles 44 and 51 of Directive (EU) 2019/944; and
(c)
identify investment gaps, in particular with respect to cross-border capacities.
In regard to point (c) of the first subparagraph, a review of barriers to the increase of cross-border capacity of the network arising from different approval procedures or practices may be annexed to the Union–wide network development plan.
2.   ACER shall provide an opinion on the national ten-year network development plans to assess their consistency with the Union–wide network development plan. If ACER identifies inconsistencies between a national ten-year network development plan and the Union–wide network development plan, it shall recommend amending the national ten-year network development plan or the Union–wide network development plan as appropriate. If such a national ten-year network development plan is developed in accordance with Article 51 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, ACER shall recommend that the regulatory authority amend the national ten-year network development plan in accordance with Article 51(7) of that Directive and inform the Commission thereof.
