Article 88
Interdependencies between civil aviation safety and security
1.   The Commission, the Agency and the Member States shall cooperate on security matters related to civil aviation, including cyber security, where interdependencies between civil aviation safety and security exist.
2.   Where interdependencies between civil aviation safety and security exist, the Agency shall, upon request, provide technical assistance to the Commission, where the Agency has the relevant safety expertise, in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (39) and other relevant provisions of Union legislation.
3.   To contribute to protecting civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference where interdependencies between civil aviation safety and security exist, the Agency shall where necessary, react without undue delay to an urgent problem which is of common concern to Member States and which falls within the scope of this Regulation by:
(a)
taking measures under point (h) of Article 77(1) to address vulnerabilities in aircraft design;
(b)
recommending corrective actions to be taken by the national competent authorities or natural and legal persons subject to this Regulation and/or disseminating relevant information to those authorities and persons, in the case that the problem affects aircraft operation, including the risks to civil aviation arising from conflict zones.
Before taking the measures referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, the Agency shall obtain the agreement of the Commission and consult the Member States. The Agency shall base those measures, where possible, on common Union risk assessments and take into account the need for rapid reaction in emergency cases.
