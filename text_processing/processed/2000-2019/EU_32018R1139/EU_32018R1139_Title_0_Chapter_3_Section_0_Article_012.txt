Article 12
Design of parts
Unless otherwise established by delegated acts referred to in Article 19, the design of parts shall be subject to certification and shall be issued with a certificate.
That certificate shall be issued upon application, when the applicant has demonstrated that the design of the part complies with the certification basis established in accordance with the delegated acts referred to in point (b)(iii) of Article 19(1).
That certificate may also be issued without such application, by an organisation approved in accordance with Article 15 which has been granted a privilege to issue those certificates in accordance with the delegated act referred to in point (k) of Article 19(1), when that organisation has determined that the design of the part complies with the certification basis established in accordance with the delegated acts referred to in point (b)(iii) of Article 19(1).
No separate certificate shall be required for the design of parts that have been certified as part of the design of a product in accordance with Article 11.
