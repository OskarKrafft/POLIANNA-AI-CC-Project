1.   The operation of the aircraft referred to in point (c) of Article 2(1) for commercial air transport shall be subject to certification and shall be issued with an authorisation.
That authorisation shall be issued upon application, when the applicant has demonstrated its capability, and the availability to it of the means, to discharge the responsibilities associated with the operation of that aircraft in compliance with the requirements specified in Article 59. The authorisation shall specify the privileges granted to the operator and the scope of the operations.
2.   Where the delegated acts referred to in Article 61 so provide, the operation of aircraft referred to in point (c) of Article 2(1) other than for commercial air transport shall be subject to certification and shall be issued with an authorisation.
That authorisation shall be issued upon application, when the applicant has demonstrated its capability, and the availability to it of the means, to discharge the responsibilities associated with the operation of that aircraft in compliance with the requirements specified in Article 59.
The authorisation shall specify the privileges granted to the operator and the scope of the operations.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, where the delegated acts referred to in Article 61 so provide, the operators of the aircraft referred to in point (c) of Article 2(1) engaged in operations other than commercial air transport shall be permitted to declare their capability, and the availability to them of the means, to discharge the responsibilities associated with the operation of that aircraft in compliance with the requirements specified in Article 59.
