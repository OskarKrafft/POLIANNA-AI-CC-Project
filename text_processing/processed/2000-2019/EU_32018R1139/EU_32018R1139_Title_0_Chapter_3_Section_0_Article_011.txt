Article 11
Design of products
The design of a product shall be subject to certification and shall be issued with a type certificate. Changes to that design shall also be subject to certification and shall result in the issuance of a certificate of changes, including of supplemental type certificates.Â Repair designs shall be subject to certification and shall be issued with an approval.
An approval shall be issued in respect of the operational suitability data associated with a type design. That approval shall be included in the type certificate or the restricted type certificate referred to in point (b) of Article 18(1), as applicable.
That type certificate, that certificate of changes, that approval of repair designs and that approval of the operational suitability data shall be issued upon application when the applicant has demonstrated that the design of the product complies with the certification basis established in accordance with the delegated acts referred to in point (b)(i) and (ii) of Article 19(1), as applicable, and that the design of the product has no feature or characteristic making it environmentally incompatible or unsafe for operation.
That type certificate, that certificate of changes, that approval of repair design and that approval of the operational suitability data may also be issued without such application, by an organisation approved in accordance with Article 15 which has been granted the privilege to issue those certificates or approvals in accordance with the delegated act referred to in point (k) of Article 19(1), when that organisation has determined that the design of the product complies with the conditions established in the third subparagraph of this paragraph.
No separate type certificate shall be required for the design of engines and propellers that have been certified as part of the design of an aircraft in accordance with this Article.
