Article 126
Fees and charges
1.   Fees and charges shall be levied for:
(a)
the issuing and renewal of certificates and the registration of declarations by the Agency pursuant to this Regulation, as well as its oversight activities concerning the activities to which those certificates and declarations relate;
(b)
publications, training and the provision of any other service by the Agency, which shall reflect the actual cost of each individual service provided;
(c)
the processing of appeals.
All fees and charges shall be expressed, and payable, in euro.
2.   The amount of the fees and charges shall be fixed at such a level as to ensure that the revenue in respect thereof covers the full cost of the activities related to the services delivered, and to avoid a significant accumulation of surplus. All expenditure of the Agency attributed to staff involved in activities referred to in paragraph 1, in particular the employer's pro-rata contribution to the pension scheme, shall be reflected in that cost. The fees and charges shall be assigned revenues for the Agency for activities related to services for which fees and charges are due.
3.   Budgetary surpluses generated through fees and charges shall fund future activities related to fees and charges or offset losses. Where a significant positive or negative budget result becomes recurrent, the level of fees and charges shall be revised.
4.   After consulting the Agency in accordance with point (i) of Article 98(2), the Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules relating to fees and charges levied by the Agency, specifying in particular the matters for which fees and charges pursuant to points (c) and (d) of Article 120(1) are due, and the amount of the fees and charges and the way in which they are paid. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 127(3).
