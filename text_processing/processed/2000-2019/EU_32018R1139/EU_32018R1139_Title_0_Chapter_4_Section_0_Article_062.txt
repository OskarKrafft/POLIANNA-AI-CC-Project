Article 62
Certification, oversight and enforcement
1.   The Commission, the Agency and the Member States shall cooperate within a single European aviation safety system to ensure compliance with this Regulation and with the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof.
2.   To ensure compliance with this Regulation and with the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, the Agency and the national competent authorities shall:
(a)
receive and assess the applications made to them, and, where applicable, issue or renew certificates and receive declarations made to them, in accordance with Chapter III;
(b)
perform oversight of holders of certificates, of natural and legal persons that made declarations, and of products, parts, equipment, ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents, flight simulation training devices and aerodromes subject to this Regulation;
(c)
conduct the necessary investigations, inspections, including ramp inspections, audits and other monitoring activities to identify possible infringements by legal or natural persons subject to this Regulation of the requirements set out in this Regulation and in the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof;
(d)
take all necessary enforcement measures, including amending, limiting, suspending or revoking certificates issued by them, grounding of aircraft and imposing penalties, in order to terminate identified infringements;
(e)
prohibit, limit or make subject to certain conditions the activities referred to in Chapter III, in the interest of safety;
(f)
ensure an appropriate level of qualification of their staff involved in certification, oversight and enforcement tasks, including by providing adequate training.
3.   Member States shall ensure that their national competent authorities are independent when taking technical decisions on certification, oversight and enforcement and exercise their tasks impartially, and transparently and are organised, staffed and managed accordingly. Member States shall also ensure that their national competent authorities have the necessary resources and capabilities to carry out the tasks assigned to them under this Regulation in an efficient and timely manner.
4.   The responsibilities for the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.
The Agency shall be responsible where those tasks have been attributed to it pursuant to Articles 77 to 82 and where those tasks have been allocated to it pursuant to Articles 64 and 65.
However, where a Member State grants an exemption in accordance with Article 41(6), point (a) of Article 80(1) shall no longer apply and that Member State shall be responsible for oversight and enforcement in respect of the provider of ATM/ANS concerned as provided for in that exemption.
The national competent authority of the Member State where the aerodrome is located shall be responsible for those tasks with respect to the aerodrome certificate referred to in Article 34(1) and the certificate for an aerodrome operator referred to in Article 37(1).
That national competent authority shall also be responsible for the oversight and enforcement tasks with respect to organisations responsible for the provision of groundhandling services or AMS at that aerodrome.
In all other cases, the national competent authority of the Member State where the natural or legal person applying for the certificate or making the declaration has its principal place of business or, if that person has no principal place of business, where it has its place of residence or place of establishment, shall be responsible for those tasks, unless the effective performance of the tasks related to certification, oversight, and enforcement requires their allocation to a national competent authority of a different Member State in accordance with the detailed rules referred to in point (d) of paragraph 14.
However, where the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 15 so provide:
(a)
aero-medical examiners, aero-medical centres and general medical practitioners shall be responsible for issuing the pilot medical certificates referred to in Article 21(1) and the air traffic controller medical certificates referred to in Article 49(1);
(b)
cabin crew training organisations that have been issued an approval in accordance with Article 24 and aircraft operators that have been issued a certificate in accordance with Article 30 shall be responsible for issuing the cabin crew attestations referred to in Article 22.
5.   Member States may decide that, by way of derogation from paragraph 4, their national competent authorities shall be jointly responsible for the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement in respect of an aircraft operator involved in commercial air transport where both of the following conditions are met:
(a)
such joint responsibility was provided for in an agreement concluded between those Member States before 1 January 1992;
(b)
those Member States have ensured that their national competent authorities effectively carry out those tasks in compliance with this Regulation and with the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof.
The Member States concerned shall, by 12 March 2019 at the latest, notify the Commission and the Agency of that joint-responsibility decision and provide them with all relevant information, in particular the agreement referred to in point (a) and the measures taken to ensure that those tasks are carried out effectively in accordance with point (b).
Where the Commission, after consulting the Agency, considers that the conditions specified in the first subparagraph have not been met, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out its decision to that effect. Once the Commission has notified such implementing acts to the Member States concerned, those Member States shall without delay modify or revoke their joint-responsibility decision and shall inform the Commission and the Agency accordingly.
The Agency shall include in the repository referred to in Article 74 all of the decisions of the Commission and of the Member States that have been notified pursuant to this paragraph.
6.   The oversight conducted by the Agency and national competent authorities shall be continuous and based on priorities set in the light of the risks to civil aviation.
7.   When conducting the ramp inspections referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2, the Agency shall cooperate with the national competent authority of the Member State in the territory of which the ramp inspection takes place.
8.   The Agency shall manage and operate the tools and procedures necessary for the collection, exchange and analysis of safety-related information obtained from ramp inspections referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2.
9.   In order to facilitate the effective exercise of their tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement, the Commission, the Agency and national competent authorities, shall exchange relevant information, including on possible or identified infringements.
10.   The Agency shall promote a common understanding and application of the requirements contained in this Regulation and in the delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, inter alia, by developing the guidance material referred to in Article 76(3) in consultation with the national competent authorities.
11.   Any legal or natural person subject to this Regulation may bring to the attention of the Agency any alleged differences in the application of the rules between the Member States. Where such differences seriously hamper the activities of those persons, or otherwise lead to substantial difficulties, the Agency and the national competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall cooperate to address, and where necessary, promptly eliminate those differences. Where those differences cannot be eliminated, the Agency shall present the matter to the Commission.
12.   The Agency and the national competent authorities shall undertake the necessary and effective actions to increase and promote awareness of civil aviation safety and disseminate safety related information relevant for the prevention of accidents and incidents.
13.   With regard to the tasks of the Agency related to certification, oversight and enforcement under this Regulation, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 128, laying down detailed rules concerning:
(a)
