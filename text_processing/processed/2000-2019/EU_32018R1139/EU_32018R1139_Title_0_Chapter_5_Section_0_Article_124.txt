Article 124
Evaluation
1.   Not later than 12 September 2023, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall perform an evaluation in compliance with the Commission guidelines to assess the Agency's performance in relation to its objectives, mandate and tasks. The evaluation shall assess the impact of this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices in establishing a high level of civil aviation safety. The evaluation shall also address the possible need to modify the mandate of the Agency, and the financial implications of any such modification. The evaluation shall take into account the views of the Management Board and of stakeholders at both Union and national level.
2.   Where the Commission considers that the continuation of the Agency is no longer justified with regard to its assigned objectives, mandate and tasks, it may propose that this Regulation be amended accordingly or repealed.
3.   The Commission shall forward the evaluation findings, together with its conclusions, to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board. An action plan with a timetable shall be included, if appropriate. The findings of the evaluation and the recommendations shall be made public.
