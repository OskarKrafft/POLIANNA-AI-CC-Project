Article 14
Access to the farm advisory system
Beneficiaries and farmers not receiving support under the CAP may use the farm advisory system on a voluntary basis.
Without prejudice to the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(2), Member States may, however, determine in accordance with objective criteria, the categories of beneficiaries that have priority access to the farm advisory system, including networks operating with limited resources within the meaning of Articles 53, 55 and 56 of Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1305/2013.
In such cases, Member States shall ensure that priority is given to those farmers with the most limited access to an advisory service other than the farm advisory system.
The farm advisory system shall ensure that beneficiaries have access to advice reflecting the specific situation of their holding.
