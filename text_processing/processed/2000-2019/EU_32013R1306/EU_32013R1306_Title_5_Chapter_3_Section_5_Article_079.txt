Article 79
Scope and definitions
1.   This Chapter lays down specific rules on the scrutiny of the commercial documents of those entities receiving or making payments relating directly or indirectly to the system of financing by the EAGF, or their representatives ('undertakings') in order to ascertain whether transactions forming part of the system of financing by the EAGF have actually been carried out and have been executed correctly.
2.   This Chapter shall not apply to measures covered by the integrated system referred to in Chapter II of this Title. In order to respond to changes in sectoral agricultural legislation and to ensure the efficiency of the system of ex-post controls established by this Chapter, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 establishing a list of measures which, due to their design and control requirements, are unsuited for additional ex-post controls by way of scrutiny of commercial documents and, therefore, are not to be subject to such scrutiny under this Chapter.
3.   For the purposes of this Chapter the following definitions shall apply:
(a)
"commercial document" means all books, registers, vouchers and supporting documents, accounts, production and quality records, and correspondence relating to the undertaking's business activity, as well as commercial data, in whatever form they may take, including electronically stored data, in so far as these documents or data relate directly or indirectly to the transactions referred to in paragraph 1;
(b)
"third party" means any natural or legal person directly or indirectly connected with transactions carried out within the financing system by the EAGF.
