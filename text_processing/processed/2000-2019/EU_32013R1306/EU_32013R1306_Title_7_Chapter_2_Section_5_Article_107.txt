The European Parliament, the Council and the Member States shall be notified forthwith of the measures referred to in the first subparagraph.

(a)
where a country uses abnormal exchange techniques such as multiple exchange rates or operates barter agreements;
(b)
where countries have currencies which are not quoted on official foreign exchange markets or where the trend in such currencies is likely to create distortion in trade.
