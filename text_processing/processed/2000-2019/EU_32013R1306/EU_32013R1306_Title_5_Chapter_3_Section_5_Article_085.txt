Article 85
Special departments
1.   In each Member State, a special department shall be responsible for monitoring the application of this Chapter. Those departments shall, in particular, be responsible for:
(a)
the performance of the scrutiny provided for in this Chapter by officials employed directly by that special department; or
(b)
the coordination and general surveillance of the scrutiny carried out by officials belonging to other departments.
Member States may also provide that scrutiny to be carried out pursuant to this Chapter is allocated between the special departments and other national departments, provided that the former is responsible for its coordination.
2.   The department or departments responsible for the application of this Chapter shall be organised in such a way as to be independent of the departments or branches of departments responsible for the payments and the scrutiny checks carried out prior to payment.
3.   In order to ensure that this Chapter is properly applied, the special department referred to in paragraph 1 shall take all the measures necessary, and it shall be entrusted by the Member State concerned with all the powers necessary, to perform the tasks referred to in this Chapter.
4.   Member States shall adopt appropriate measures to penalise natural or legal persons who fail to fulfil their obligations under this Chapter.
