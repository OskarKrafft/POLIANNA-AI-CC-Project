Article 87
Access to information and scrutiny by the Commission
1.   In accordance with the relevant national laws, Commission officials shall have access to all documents prepared either with a view to or following the scrutiny organised under this Chapter and to the data held, including those stored in the data-processing systems. That data shall be provided upon request on an appropriate data support medium.
2.   The scrutiny referred to in Article 80 shall be carried out by the officials of the Member States. Officials of the Commission may participate in that scrutiny. They may not themselves exercise the powers of scrutiny accorded to national officials. However, they shall have access to the same premises and to the same documents as the officials of the Member States.
3.   In the case of scrutiny taking place under Article 83, officials of the requesting Member State may be present, with the agreement of the requested Member State, at the scrutiny in the requested Member State and have access to the same premises and the same documents as the officials of that Member State.
Officials of the requesting Member State present at scrutiny in the requested Member State shall at all time be able to furnish proof of their official capacity. The scrutiny shall at all times be carried out by officials of the requested Member State.
4.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Regulations (EU, Euratom) 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, where national provisions concerning criminal procedure reserve certain acts for officials specifically designated by the national law, neither the officials of the Commission, nor the officials of the Member State referred to in paragraph 3, shall take part in these acts. In any event, they shall, in particular not take part in home visits or the formal interrogation of persons in the context of the criminal law of the Member State concerned. They shall, however, have access to information thus obtained.
