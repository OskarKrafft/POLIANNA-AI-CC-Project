Delegated powers
1.   In order to ensure that the integrated system provided for in this Chapter is implemented in an efficient, coherent and non-discriminatory way which protects the financial interests of the Union, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 concerning:

specific definitions needed to ensure a harmonised implementation of the integrated system, in addition to those provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013;

with regards to Articles 67 to 75, rules on further measures necessary to ensure the compliance with control requirements laid down in this Regulation or in sectoral agricultural legislation to be taken by the Member States in respect of producers, services, bodies, organisations or other operators, such as slaughterhouses or associations involved in the procedure for the granting of the aid, where this Regulation does not provide for relevant administrative penalties; such measures shall as far as possible, follow, mutatis mutandis, the provisions on penalties set out in paragraphs (1) to (5) of Article 77.
2.   In order to ensure a correct distribution of the funds resulting from the aid applications provided for in Article 72 to the entitled beneficiaries and to allow for verification of the fulfilment by them of the obligations related thereto, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 concerning:
(a)
the basic features, technical rules, including, for the update of reference parcels, appropriate tolerance margins taking into account the outline and condition of the parcel, and including rules on the inclusion of landscape features located adjacent to a parcel, and quality requirements for the identification system for agricultural parcels provided for in Article 70 and for the identification of the beneficiaries as provided for in Article 73;
