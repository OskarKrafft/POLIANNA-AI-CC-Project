Article 49
Access to documents
The accredited paying agencies shall keep supporting documents relating to payments made and documents relating to the performance of the administrative and physical checks required by Union law, and shall make the documents and information available to the Commission. Those supporting documents may be kept in electronic form under the conditions laid down by the Commission on the basis of Article 50(2).
Where those documents are kept by an authority acting under delegation from a paying agency and responsible for authorising expenditure, that authority shall send reports to the accredited paying agency on the number of checks made, their content and the measures taken in the light of their results.
