(a)
the type of measures eligible for Union financing and the reimbursement conditions;
(b)
the eligibility conditions and calculation methods based on the information actually observed by the paying agencies or based on flat-rates determined by the Commission, or based on flat-rate or non-flat-rate amounts provided for by the sectoral agricultural legislation.
3.   In order to ensure the proper management of the appropriations entered in the Union's budget for the EAGF, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115, laying down rules on the valuation of operations in connection with public intervention, the measures to be taken in the case of loss or deterioration of products under the public intervention, and on the determination of the amounts to be financed.
4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts, fixing the amounts referred to in paragraph 1. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 116(2).
