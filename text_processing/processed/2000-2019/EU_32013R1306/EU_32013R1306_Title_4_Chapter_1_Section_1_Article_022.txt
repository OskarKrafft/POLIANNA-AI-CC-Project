Article 22
Monitoring of agricultural resources
The measures financed pursuant to point (c) of Article 6 shall aim to give the Commission the means to:
(a)
manage Union agricultural markets in a global context;
(b)
ensure agri-economic and agri-environmental monitoring of agricultural land, including agro-forestry, and monitoring of the condition of crops so as to enable estimates to be made, in particular as regards yields and agricultural production;
(c)
share the access to such estimates in an international context, such as those initiatives coordinated by United Nations organisations or other international agencies;
(d)
contribute to transparency of world markets; and
(e)
ensure technological follow-up of the agri-meteorological system.
The measures financed pursuant to point (c) of Article 6 concern the collection or purchase of data needed to implement and monitor the CAP, including satellite data and meteorological data, the creation of a spatial data infrastructure and a website, the carrying out of specific studies on climatic conditions, remote sensing used to assist in the monitoring of soil health and the updating of agri-meteorological and econometric models. Where necessary, those measures shall be carried out in collaboration with national laboratories and bodies.
