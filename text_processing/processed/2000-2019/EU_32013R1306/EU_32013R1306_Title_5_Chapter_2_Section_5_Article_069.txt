Article 69
Computerised database
1.   The computerised database ("the database") shall record, for each beneficiary of the support referred to in Article 67(2), the data obtained from aid applications and payment claims.
The database shall, in particular, allow consultation through the competent authority of the Member State, of the data relating to the current calendar and/or marketing years and to the previous ten such years. Where the support level of farmers is affected by the data relating to earlier calendar and/or marketing years, starting with 2000, the database shall also allow consultation of the data relating to those years. The database shall also allow direct and immediate consultation of the data relating to at least the previous four consecutive calendar years and for data related to "permanent pasture" as defined in point (c) of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 (37) in its original version and, for periods as from its date of application, "permanent grassland and permanent pasture" as defined in point (h) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013, relating to at least the previous five consecutive calendar years.
By way of derogation from the second subparagraph, the Member States which acceded to the Union in or after 2004, shall only be required to ensure consultation of the data as from the year of their accession.
2.   Member States may set up decentralised databases on condition that these, and the administrative procedures for recording and accessing data, are designed to be homogeneous throughout the territory of the Member State and are compatible with one another in order to allow for cross-checks.
