Article 40
Compliance with payment deadlines
Where payment deadlines are laid down by Union law, any payment made by the paying agencies to the beneficiaries before the earliest possible date of payment and after the latest possible date of payment shall make the payments ineligible for Union financing, except in the cases, conditions and limits to be determined taking into account the principle of proportionality.
In order to make expenditure effected before the earliest possible date of payment or after the latest possible date of payment eligible for Union financing, while limiting the financial impact of doing so, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115, derogating from the rule contained in the first paragraph.
