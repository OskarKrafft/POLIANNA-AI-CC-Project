Article 80
Scrutiny by Member States
1.   Member States shall carry out systematic scrutiny of the commercial documents of undertakings taking account of the nature of the transactions to be scrutinised. Member States shall ensure that the selection of undertakings for scrutiny gives the best possible assurance of the effectiveness of the measures for preventing and detecting irregularities. The selection shall take account, inter alia, of the financial importance of the undertakings in that system and of other risk factors.
2.   In appropriate cases, the scrutiny provided for in paragraph 1 shall be extended to natural and legal persons with whom undertakings are associated and to such other natural or legal persons as may be relevant for the pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 81.
3.   The scrutiny carried out pursuant to this Chapter shall not prejudice the checks undertaken pursuant to Articles 47 and 48.
