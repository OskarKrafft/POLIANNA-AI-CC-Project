Article 42
Suspension of payments in the case of late submission
Where sectoral agricultural legislation requires Member States to submit, within a specific period of time, information on the number of checks carried out under Article 59 and their outcomes and where the Member States overrun that period, the Commission may suspend the monthly payments referred to in Article 18 or the interim payments referred to in Article 36 provided that the Commission has made available to the Member States in good time prior to the start of the reference period all the information, forms and explanations they need to compile the relevant statistics. The amount to be suspended shall not exceed 1,5Â % of the expenditure for which the relevant statistical information has not been sent in time. In applying the suspension, the Commission shall act in accordance with the principle of proportionality, taking account of the extent of the delay. In particular, account shall be taken of whether the late submission of information places the annual budget discharge mechanism at risk. Before suspending the monthly payments the Commission shall notify the Member State concerned in writing. The Commission shall reimburse the suspended amounts when it receives the statistical information from the Member States concerned, provided that the date of receipt is not later than 31 January of the following year.
