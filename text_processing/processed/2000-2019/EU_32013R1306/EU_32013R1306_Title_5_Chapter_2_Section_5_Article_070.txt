Article 70
Identification system for agricultural parcels
1.   The identification system for agricultural parcels shall be established on the basis of maps, land registry documents or other cartographic references. Use shall be made of computerised geographical information system techniques, including aerial or spatial orthoimagery, with a homogenous standard that guarantees a level of accuracy that is at least equivalent to that of cartography at a scale of 1:10 000 and, as from 2016, at a scale of 1:5 000, while taking into account the outline and condition of the parcel. This shall be fixed in accordance with existing Union standards.
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, Member States may continue to make use of such techniques including aerial or spatial orthoimagery, with a homogenous standard that guarantees a level of accuracy that is at least equivalent to that of cartography at a scale of 1:10 000 where they were acquired on the basis of long-term contracts that were agreed before November 2012.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the identification system for agricultural parcels contains a reference layer to accommodate ecological focus areas. That reference layer shall, in particular, cover the relevant specific commitments and/or environmental certification schemes referred to in Article 43(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 that are equivalent to the practices in Article 46 of that Regulation before the application forms referred to in Article 72 of this Regulation for payments for agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment referred to in Articles 43 to 46 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 are provided in respect of claim year 2018 at the latest.
