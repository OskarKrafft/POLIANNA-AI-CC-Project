Article 14
Types of financial instruments
1.   Financial instruments set up in accordance with Title VIII of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 may be used to facilitate access to finance by entities implementing actions contributing to projects of common interest as defined in Regulations (EU) No 1315/2013 and (EU) No 347/2013 and in a Regulation on guidelines for trans-European networks in the area of telecommunications infrastructure, and to the achievement of their objectives. The financial instruments shall be based on ex-ante assessments of market imperfections or sub-optimal investment situations and investment needs. The main terms, conditions and procedures for each financial instrument are laid down in Part III of Annex I to this Regulation.
2.   The overall contribution from the Union budget to the financial instruments shall not exceed 10 % of the overall financial envelope of the CEF as referred to in Article 5(1).
3.   All financial instruments established under Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 and the risk-sharing instrument for project bonds established under Decision No 1639/2006/EC may, if applicable and subject to a prior evaluation, be merged together with those under this Regulation.
The merging of project bonds shall be subject to the interim report to be carried out in the second half of 2013 as defined in Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 and in Decision No 1639/2006/EC. The Project Bond Initiative shall start up progressively within a ceiling of EUR 230 000 000 during the years 2014 and 2015. The full implementation of the initiative shall be subject to independent full-scale evaluation to be carried out in 2015 as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 and in Decision No 1639/2006/EC. In the light of that evaluation, taking into account all options, the Commission shall consider proposing appropriate regulatory changes, including legislative changes, in particular if the predicted market uptake is not satisfactory or in the event that sufficient alternative sources of long-term debt financing become available.
4.   The following financial instruments may be used:
(a)
equity instruments, such as investment funds with a focus on providing risk capital for actions contributing to projects of common interest;
(b)
loans and/or guarantees facilitated by risk-sharing instruments, including the credit enhancement mechanism for project bonds, backing individual projects or portfolios of projects issued by a financial institution on its own resources with a Union contribution to the provisioning and/or capital allocation.
