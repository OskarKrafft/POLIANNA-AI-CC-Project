Article 22
Responsibility of beneficiaries and Member States
Within their respective responsibilities, and without prejudice to the obligations incumbent on beneficiaries under the conditions governing grants, beneficiaries and Member States shall make every effort to implement the projects of common interest which receive Union financial assistance granted under this Regulation.
Member States shall undertake the technical monitoring and financial control of actions in close cooperation with the Commission and shall certify that the expenditure incurred in respect of projects or parts thereof has been disbursed and that the disbursement was in conformity with the relevant rules. The Member States may request the Commission to participate during on-the-spot checks and inspections.
Member States shall inform the Commission annually, if relevant through an interactive geographical and technical information system, about the progress made in implementing projects of common interest and the investments made for this purpose, including the amount of support used with a view to attaining climate-change objectives. On that basis, the Commission shall make public, and update at least annually, information about the specific projects under the CEF.
