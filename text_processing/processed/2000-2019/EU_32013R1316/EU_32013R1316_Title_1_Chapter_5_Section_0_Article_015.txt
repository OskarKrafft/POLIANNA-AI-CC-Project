Article 15
Conditions for granting financial assistance through financial instruments
1.   Actions supported by means of financial instruments shall be selected on the basis of maturity and shall seek sectoral diversification in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 as well as geographical balance across the Member States. They shall:
(a)
represent European added value;
(b)
respond to the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy;
(c)
present a leverage effect with regard to Union support, i.e. aim at mobilising a global investment exceeding the size of the Union contribution according to the indicators defined in advance.
