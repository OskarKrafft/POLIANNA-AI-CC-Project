Article 59
No subscription of own shares
1.   The shares of a company may not be subscribed for by the company itself.
2.   If the shares of a company have been subscribed for by a person acting in his or her own name, but on behalf of the company, the subscriber shall be deemed to have subscribed for them for his or her own account.
3.   The persons or companies or firms referred to in point (i) of Article 4 or, in cases of an increase in subscribed capital, the members of the administrative or management body shall be liable to pay for shares subscribed in contravention of this Article.
However, the laws of a Member State may provide that any such person may be released from his or her obligation if they prove that no fault is attributable to them personally.
