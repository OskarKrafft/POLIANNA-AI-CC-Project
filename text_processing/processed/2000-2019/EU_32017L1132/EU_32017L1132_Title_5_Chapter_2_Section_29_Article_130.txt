Article 130
Registration
The law of each of the Member States to whose jurisdiction the merging companies were subject shall determine, with respect to the territory of that State, the arrangements, in accordance with Article 16, for publicising the completion of the cross-border merger in the public register in which each of the companies is required to file documents.
The registry for the registration of the company resulting from the cross-border merger shall notify, through the system of interconnection of registers established in accordance with Article 22(2) and without delay, the registry in which each of the companies was required to file documents that the cross-border merger has taken effect. Deletion of the old registration, if applicable, shall be effected on receipt of that notification, and not before.
