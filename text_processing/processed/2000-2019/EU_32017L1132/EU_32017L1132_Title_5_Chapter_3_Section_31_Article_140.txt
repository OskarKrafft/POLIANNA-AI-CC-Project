Article 140
Derogation from the requirement of approval by the general meeting of a recipient company
The laws of a Member State need not require approval of a division by a general meeting of a recipient company if the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the publication provided for in Article 138 is effected, for each recipient company, at least one month before the date fixed for the general meeting of the company being divided which is to decide on the draft terms of division;
(b)
at least one month before the date specified in point (a), all shareholders of each recipient company are entitled to inspect the documents specified in Article 143(1) at the registered office of that company;
(c)
one or more shareholders of any recipient company holding a minimum percentage of the subscribed capital is entitled to require that a general meeting of such recipient company be called to decide whether to approve the division. Such minimum percentage may not be fixed at more than 5 %. Member States may, however, provide for the exclusion of non-voting shares from this calculation.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first paragraph, Article 143(2), (3) and (4) shall apply.
