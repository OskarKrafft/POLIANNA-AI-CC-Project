Article 8
Assessment
1.   In respect of each marine region or subregion, Member States shall make an initial assessment of their marine waters, taking account of existing data where available and comprising the following:
(a)
an analysis of the essential features and characteristics, and current environmental status of those waters, based on the indicative lists of elements set out in Table 1 of Annex III, and covering the physical and chemical features, the habitat types, the biological features and the hydro-morphology;
(b)
an analysis of the predominant pressures and impacts, including human activity, on the environmental status of those waters which:
(i)
is based on the indicative lists of elements set out in Table 2 of Annex III, and covers the qualitative and quantitative mix of the various pressures, as well as discernible trends;
(ii)
covers the main cumulative and synergetic effects; and
(iii)
takes account of the relevant assessments which have been made pursuant to existing Community legislation;
(c)
an economic and social analysis of the use of those waters and of the cost of degradation of the marine environment.
2.   The analyses referred to in paragraph 1 shall take into account elements regarding coastal, transitional and territorial waters covered by relevant provisions of existing Community legislation, in particular Directive 2000/60/EC. They shall also take into account, or use as their basis, other relevant assessments such as those carried out jointly in the context of Regional Sea Conventions, so as to produce a comprehensive assessment of the status of the marine environment.
3.   In preparing assessments pursuant to paragraph 1, Member States shall, by means of the coordination established pursuant to Articles 5 and 6, make every effort to ensure that:
(a)
assessment methodologies are consistent across the marine region or subregion;
(b)
transboundary impacts and transboundary features are taken into account.
