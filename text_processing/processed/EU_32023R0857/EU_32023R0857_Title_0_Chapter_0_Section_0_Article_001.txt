Article 1
Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018/842
Regulation (EU) 2018/842 is amended as follows:
(1)
Article 1 is replaced by the following:
‘Article 1
Subject matter
This Regulation lays down obligations on Member States with respect to their minimum contributions for the period from 2021 to 2030 to fulfilling the Union’s target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % below 2005 levels in 2030 in the sectors covered by Article 2 of this Regulation. It contributes to the long-term target of climate neutrality in the Union at the latest by 2050, with the aim of achieving negative emissions thereafter. It thereby contributes to achieving the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*1) (‘European Climate Law’) and the Paris Agreement. This Regulation also lays down rules on determining annual emission allocations and for the evaluation of Member States’ progress towards meeting their minimum contributions.

(*1)  Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’) (OJ L 243, 9.7.2021, p. 1).’;"
                        
(2)
in Article 2, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   This Regulation applies to the greenhouse gas emissions from IPCC source categories of energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture and waste as determined pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council (*2), excluding greenhouse gas emissions from the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC, other than the activity ‘maritime transport’ and activities only listed therein for the purposes of Articles 14 and 15 of that Directive.
