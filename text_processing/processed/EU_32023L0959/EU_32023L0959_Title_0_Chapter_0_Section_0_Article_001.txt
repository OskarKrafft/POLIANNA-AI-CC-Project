‘Article 3ga
Scope of application to maritime transport activities
1.   The allocation of allowances and the application of surrender requirements in respect of maritime transport activities shall apply in respect of fifty percent (50 %) of the emissions from ships performing voyages departing from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port of call outside the jurisdiction of a Member State, fifty percent (50 %) of the emissions from ships performing voyages departing from a port of call outside the jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, one hundred percent (100 %) of emissions from ships performing voyages departing from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State and arriving at a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, and one hundred percent (100 %) of emissions from ships within a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State.
2.   The Commission shall, by 31 December 2023, by means of implementing acts establish a list of neighbouring container transhipment ports and update that list by 31 December every two years thereafter.
Those implementing acts shall list a port as a neighbouring container transhipment port where the share of transhipment of containers, measured in twenty-foot equivalent units, exceeds 65 % of the total container traffic of that port during the most recent twelve-month period for which relevant data are available and where that port is located outside the Union but less than 300 nautical miles from a port under the jurisdiction of a Member State. For the purposes of this paragraph, containers shall be considered to be transhipped when they are unloaded from a ship to the port for the sole purpose of being loaded onto another ship. The list established by the Commission pursuant to the first subparagraph shall not include ports located in a third country for which that third country effectively applies measures equivalent to this Directive.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 22a(2).
3.   Articles 9, 9a and 10 shall apply to maritime transport activities in the same manner as they apply to other activities covered by the EU ETS with the following exception with regard to the application of Article 10.
Until 31 December 2030, a share of allowances shall be attributed to Member States with a ratio of shipping companies that would have been under their responsibility pursuant to Article 3gf compared to their respective population in 2020 and based on data available for the period from 2018 to 2020, above 15 shipping companies per million inhabitants. The quantity of allowances shall correspond to 3,5 % of the additional quantity of allowances due to the increase in the cap for maritime transport referred to in Article 9, third paragraph, in the relevant year. For the years 2024 and 2025, the quantity of allowances shall in addition be multiplied by the percentages applicable to the relevant year pursuant to Article 3gb, first paragraph, points (a) and (b). The revenue generated from the auctioning of that share of allowances should be used for the purposes referred to in Article 10(3), first subparagraph, point (g), with regard to the maritime sector, and points (f) and (i). 50 % of the quantity of allowances shall be distributed among the relevant Member States based on the share of shipping companies under their responsibility and the remainder distributed in equal shares between them.
Article 3gb
Phase-in of requirements for maritime transport
Shipping companies shall be liable to surrender allowances according to the following schedule:
(a)
40 % of verified emissions reported for 2024 that would be subject to surrender requirements in accordance with Article 12;
(b)
70 % of verified emissions reported for 2025 that would be subject to surrender requirements in accordance with Article 12;
(c)
100 % of verified emissions reported for 2026 and each year thereafter in accordance with Article 12.
Where fewer allowances are surrendered compared to the verified emissions from maritime transport for the years 2024 and 2025, once the difference between verified emissions and allowances surrendered has been established in respect of each year, an amount of allowances corresponding to that difference shall be cancelled rather than auctioned pursuant to Article 10.
Article 3gc
Provisions for transfer of the costs of the EU ETS from the shipping company to another entity
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that when the ultimate responsibility for the purchase of the fuel, or the operation of the ship, or both, is assumed by an entity other than the shipping company pursuant to a contractual arrangement, the shipping company is entitled to reimbursement from that entity for the costs arising from the surrender of allowances.
‘Operation of the ship’ for the purposes of this Article means determining the cargo carried or the route and the speed of the ship. The shipping company shall remain the entity responsible for surrendering allowances as required under Articles 3gb and 12 and for overall compliance with the provisions of national law transposing this Directive. Member States shall ensure that shipping companies under their responsibility comply with the obligations to surrender allowances under Articles 3gb and 12, notwithstanding the entitlement of such shipping companies to be reimbursed by the commercial operators for the costs arising from the surrender.
Article 3gd
Monitoring and reporting of emissions from maritime transport
In respect of emissions from maritime transport activities listed in Annex I to this Directive, the administering authority in respect of a shipping company shall ensure that a shipping company under its responsibility monitors and reports the relevant parameters during a reporting period, and submits to it aggregated emissions data at company level in accordance with Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2015/757.
Article 3ge
Verification and accreditation rules for emissions from maritime transport
The administering authority in respect of a shipping company shall ensure that the reporting of aggregated emissions data at shipping company level submitted by a shipping company pursuant to Article 3gd of this Directive is verified in accordance with the verification and accreditation rules set out in Chapter III of Regulation (EU) 2015/757.

(a)
in the case of a shipping company registered in a Member State, the Member State in which the shipping company is registered;
(b)
in the case of a shipping company that is not registered in a Member State, the Member State with the greatest estimated number of port calls from voyages performed by that shipping company in the preceding four monitoring years and falling within the scope set out in Article 3ga;
(c)
in the case of a shipping company that is not registered in a Member State and that did not carry out any voyage falling within the scope set out in Article 3ga in the preceding four monitoring years, the Member State where a ship of the shipping company has started or ended its first voyage falling within the scope set out in that Article.
2.   Based on the best available information, the Commission shall establish by means of implementing acts:
(a)
before 1 February 2024, a list of shipping companies which performed a maritime transport activity listed in Annex I that fell within the scope set out in Article 3ga on or with effect from 1 January 2024, specifying the administering authority in respect of a shipping company in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article;
(b)
before 1 February 2026 and every two years thereafter, an updated list to reattribute shipping companies registered in a Member State to another administering authority in respect of a shipping company if they changed the Member State of registration within the Union in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article or to include shipping companies which have subsequently performed a maritime transport activity listed in Annex I that fell within the scope set out in Article 3ga, in accordance with paragraph 1, point (c), of this Article; and
(c)
before 1 February 2028 and every four years thereafter, an updated list to reattribute shipping companies that are not registered in a Member State to another administering authority in respect of a shipping company in accordance with paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article.
3.   An administering authority in respect of a shipping company that, according to the list established pursuant to paragraph 2, is responsible for a shipping company shall retain that responsibility regardless of subsequent changes in the shipping company’s activities or registration until those changes are reflected in an updated list.
4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish detailed rules relating to the administration of shipping companies by administering authorities in respect of a shipping company under this Directive. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 22a(2).
Article 3gg
Reporting and review
1.   In the event of the adoption by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of a global market-based measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, the Commission shall review this Directive in light of that adopted measure.
To that end, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council within 18 months of the adoption of such a global market-based measure and before it becomes operational. In that report, the Commission shall examine the global market-based measure as regards:
(a)
its ambition in light of the objectives of the Paris Agreement;
(b)
its overall environmental integrity, including in comparison with the provisions of this Directive covering maritime transport; and
(c)
any issue related to the coherence between the EU ETS and that measure.
Where appropriate, the Commission may accompany the report referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph with a legislative proposal to amend this Directive in a manner that is consistent with the Union 2030 climate target and the climate-neutrality objective set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, and with the aim of preserving the environmental integrity and effectiveness of Union climate action, in order to ensure coherence between the implementation of the global market-based measure and the EU ETS, while avoiding any significant double burden.
2.   In the event that the IMO does not adopt by 2028 a global market-based measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and at least to a level comparable to that resulting from the Union measures taken under this Directive, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council in which it shall examine the need to apply the allocation of allowances and surrender requirements in respect of more than fifty percent (50 %) of the emissions from ships performing voyages between a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State and a port of call outside the jurisdiction of a Member State, in light of the objectives of the Paris Agreement. In that report, the Commission shall, in particular, consider progress at IMO level and examine whether any third country has a market-based measure equivalent to this Directive and assess the risk of an increase in evasive practices, including through a shift to other modes of transport or a shift of port hubs to ports outside the Union.
Where appropriate, the report referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend this Directive.
3.   The Commission shall monitor the implementation of this Chapter in relation to maritime transport, in particular to detect evasive behaviour in order to prevent such behaviour at an early stage, including giving consideration to outermost regions, and report biennially from 2024 on the implementation of this Chapter in relation to maritime transport and possible trends regarding shipping companies seeking to evade the requirements of this Directive. The Commission shall also monitor impacts regarding, inter alia, possible transport cost increases, market distortions and changes in port traffic, such as port evasion and shifts of transhipment hubs, the overall competitiveness of the maritime sector in the Member States, and in particular impacts on those shipping services that constitute essential services of territorial continuity. If appropriate, the Commission shall propose measures to ensure the effective implementation of this Chapter in relation to maritime transport, in particular measures to address trends regarding shipping companies seeking to evade the requirements of this Directive.
4.   No later than 30 September 2028, the Commission shall assess the appropriateness of extending the application of Article 3ga(3), second subparagraph, beyond 31 December 2030 and, if appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to that effect.
5.   No later than 31 December 2026, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council in which it shall examine the feasibility and economic, environmental and social impacts of the inclusion in this Directive of emissions from ships, including offshore ships, below 5 000 gross tonnage but not below 400 gross tonnage, building, in particular, on the analysis accompanying the review of Regulation (EU) 2015/757 due by 31 December 2024.
That report shall also consider the interlinkages between this Directive and Regulation (EU) 2015/757 and draw on the experience gained from the application thereof. In that report, the Commission shall also examine how this Directive can best account for the uptake of renewable and low-carbon maritime fuels on a lifecycle basis. If appropriate, the report may be accompanied by legislative proposals.’

Article 10a is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraph 1 is amended as follows:
(i)
the following subparagraphs are inserted after the second subparagraph:

                                                      ‘If an installation is covered by the obligation to conduct an energy audit or to implement a certified energy management system under Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (*14) and if the recommendations of the audit report or of the certified energy management system are not implemented, unless the pay-back time for the relevant investments exceeds three years or unless the costs of those investments are disproportionate, then the amount of free allocation shall be reduced by 20 %. The amount of free allocation shall not be reduced if an operator demonstrates that it has implemented other measures which lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions equivalent to those recommended by the audit report or by the certified energy management system for the installation concerned.
The Commission shall supplement this Directive by providing, in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this paragraph and without prejudice to the rules applicable under Directive 2012/27/EU, for administratively simple harmonised rules for the application of the third subparagraph of this paragraph that ensure that the application of the conditionality does not jeopardise a level playing field, environmental integrity or equal treatment between installations across the Union. Those harmonised rules shall in particular provide for timelines, for criteria for the recognition of implemented energy efficiency measures as well as for alternative measures reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using the procedure for national implementing measures in accordance with Article 11(1) of this Directive.
In addition to the requirements set out in the third subparagraph of this paragraph, the reduction by 20 % referred to in that subparagraph shall be applied where, by 1 May 2024, operators of installations whose greenhouse gas emission levels are higher than the 80th percentile of emission levels for the relevant product benchmarks have not established a climate-neutrality plan for each of those installations for its activities covered by this Directive. That plan shall contain the elements specified in Article 10b(4) and be established in accordance with the implementing acts provided for in that Article. Article 10b(4) shall be read as only referring to the installation level. The achievement of the targets and milestones referred to in Article 10b(4), third subparagraph, point (b), shall be verified in respect of the period until 31 December 2025 and in respect of each period ending 31 December of each fifth year thereafter, in accordance with the verification and accreditation procedures provided for in Article 15. No free allowances beyond 80 % shall be allocated if achievement of the intermediate targets and milestones has not been verified in respect of the period until the end of 2025 or in respect of the period from 2026 to 2030.
Allowances that are not allocated due to a reduction of free allocation in accordance with the third and fifth subparagraphs of this paragraph shall be used to exempt installations from the adjustment in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article. Where any such allowances remain, 50 % of those allowances shall be made available to support innovation in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article. The other 50 % of those allowances shall be auctioned in accordance with Article 10(1) of this Directive and Member States should use the respective revenues to address any residual risk of carbon leakage in the sectors covered by Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, supporting the transition and promoting their decarbonisation in accordance with State aid rules.
No free allocation shall be given to installations in sectors or subsectors to the extent they are covered by other measures to address the risk of carbon leakage as established by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The measures referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be adjusted accordingly.

                                                      ‘For each sector and subsector, in principle, the benchmark shall be calculated for products rather than for inputs, in order to maximise greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy efficiency savings throughout each production process of the sector or the subsector concerned. In order to provide further incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency and to ensure a level playing field for installations using new technologies that partly reduce or fully eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and installations using existing technologies, the determined Union-wide ex-ante benchmarks shall be reviewed in relation to their application in the period from 2026 to 2030, with a view to potentially modifying the definitions and system boundaries of existing product benchmarks, considering as guiding principles the circular use-potential of materials and that the benchmarks should be independent of the feedstock and the type of production process, where the production processes have the same purpose. The Commission shall endeavour to adopt the implementing acts for the purpose of determining the revised benchmark values for free allocation in accordance with paragraph 2, third subparagraph, as soon as possible and before the start of the period from 2026 to 2030.’;
(b)
the following paragraph is inserted:
‘1a.   Subject to the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, no free allocation shall be given in relation to the production of goods listed in Annex I to that Regulation.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, for the first years of application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the production of goods listed in Annex I to that Regulation shall benefit from free allocation in reduced amounts. A factor reducing the free allocation for the production of those goods shall be applied (CBAM factor). The CBAM factor shall be equal to 100 % for the period between the entry into force of that Regulation and the end of 2025 and, subject to the application of provisions referred to in Article 36(2), point (b), of that Regulation, shall be equal to 97,5 % in 2026, 95 % in 2027, 90 % in 2028, 77,5 % in 2029, 51,5 % in 2030, 39 % in 2031, 26,5 % in 2032 and 14 % in 2033. From 2034, no CBAM factor shall apply.
The reduction of free allocation shall be calculated annually as the average share of the demand for free allocation for the production of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 compared to the calculated total free allocation demand for all installations, for the relevant period referred to in Article 11(1) of this Directive. The CBAM factor shall be applied in this calculation.
Allowances resulting from the reduction of free allocation shall be made available to support innovation in accordance with paragraph 8.
By 31 December 2024 and as part of its annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council pursuant to Article 10(5) of this Directive, the Commission shall assess the carbon leakage risk for goods subject to CBAM and produced in the Union for export to third countries which do not apply the EU ETS or a similar carbon pricing mechanism. The report shall in particular assess the carbon leakage risk in sectors to which CBAM will apply, in particular the role and accelerated uptake of hydrogen, and the developments as regards trade flows and the embedded emissions of goods produced by those sectors on the global market. Where the report concludes that there is a carbon leakage risk for goods produced in the Union for export to third countries which do not apply the EU ETS or an equivalent carbon pricing mechanism, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to address that carbon leakage risk in a manner that is compliant with the rules of the World Trade Organization, including Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and takes into account the decarbonisation of installations in the Union.’
(c)
paragraph 2 is amended as follows:
(i)
in the third subparagraph, point (c) is replaced by the following:
‘(c)
For the period from 2026 to 2030, the benchmark values shall be determined in the same manner as set out in points (a) and (d) of this subparagraph, taking into account point (e) of this subparagraph, on the basis of information submitted pursuant to Article 11 for the years 2021 and 2022 and on the basis of applying the annual reduction rate in respect of each year between 2008 and 2028.’;
(ii)
in the third subparagraph, the following points are added:
‘(d)
Where the annual reduction rate exceeds 2,5 % or is below 0,3 %, the benchmark values for the period from 2026 to 2030 shall be the benchmark values applicable in the period from 2013 to 2020 reduced by whichever of those two percentage rates is relevant, in respect of each year between 2008 and 2028.
(e)
For the period from 2026 to 2030, the annual reduction rate for the product benchmark for hot metal shall not be affected by the change of benchmark definitions and system boundaries applicable pursuant to paragraph 1, eighth subparagraph.’;
(iii)
the fourth subparagraph is replaced by the following:

                                                      ‘By way of derogation regarding the benchmark values for aromatics and syngas, those benchmark values shall be adjusted by the same percentage as the refineries benchmarks in order to preserve a level playing field for producers of those products.’;
(d)
paragraphs 3 and 4 are deleted;
(e)
paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:
‘5.   In order to respect the auctioning share set out in Article 10, for every year in which the sum of free allocations does not reach the maximum amount that respects the auctioning share, the remaining allowances up to that amount shall be used to prevent or limit reduction of free allocations to respect the auctioning share in later years. Where, nonetheless, the maximum amount is reached, free allocations shall be adjusted accordingly. Any such adjustment shall be done in a uniform manner. However, installations whose greenhouse gas emission levels are below the average of the 10 % most efficient installations in a sector or subsector in the Union for the relevant benchmarks in a year when the adjustment applies shall be exempted from that adjustment.’
(f)
in paragraph 6, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:

                                          ‘Member States should adopt financial measures in accordance with the second and fourth subparagraphs of this paragraph in favour of sectors or subsectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage due to significant indirect costs that are actually incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in electricity prices, provided that such financial measures are in accordance with State aid rules, and in particular do not cause undue distortions of competition in the internal market. The financial measures adopted should not compensate indirect costs covered by free allocation in accordance with the benchmarks established pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article. Where a Member State spends an amount higher than the equivalent of 25 % of the auction revenues referred to in Article 10(3) for the year in which the indirect costs were incurred, it shall set out the reasons for exceeding that amount.’;
(g)
in paragraph 7, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:

                                          ‘From 2021, allowances that, pursuant to paragraphs 19, 20 and 22, are not allocated to installations shall be added to the amount of allowances set aside in accordance with the first subparagraph, first sentence, of this paragraph.’;
(h)
paragraph 8 is replaced by the following:
‘8.   345 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be allocated for free pursuant to this Article, and 80 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be auctioned pursuant to Article 10, as well as the allowances resulting from the reduction of free allocation referred to in paragraph 1a of this Article, shall be made available to a fund (the ‘Innovation Fund’) with the objective of supporting innovation in low- and zero-carbon techniques, processes and technologies that contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of the sectors covered by this Directive and contribute to zero pollution and circularity objectives, including projects aimed at scaling up such techniques, processes and technologies with a view to their broad roll-out across the Union. Such projects shall possess significant greenhouse gas emissions abatement potential and contribute to energy and resource savings in line with the Union’s climate and energy targets for 2030.
The Commission shall frontload Innovation Fund allowances to ensure that an adequate amount of resources is available to foster innovation, including for scaling up.
Allowances that are not issued to aircraft operators due to them ceasing operations and which are not necessary to cover any shortfall in surrenders by those operators shall also be used for innovation support as referred to in the first subparagraph.
Moreover, 5 million allowances from the quantity referred to in Article 3c(5) and (7) relating to aviation allocations for 2026 shall be made available for innovation support as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
In addition, 50 million unallocated allowances from the market stability reserve shall supplement any remaining revenues from the 300 million allowances available in the period from 2013 to 2020 under Commission Decision 2010/670/EU (*15), and shall be used in a timely manner for innovation support as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
The Innovation Fund shall cover the sectors listed in Annexes I and III, as well as products and processes substituting carbon intensive ones produced or used in sectors listed in Annex I, including innovative renewable energy and energy storage technologies and environmentally safe carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) that contributes substantially to mitigating climate change, in particular for unavoidable process emissions, and shall help stimulate the construction and operation of projects aimed at the environmentally safe capture, transport and geological storage (CCS) of CO2, in particular for unavoidable industrial process emissions, and the direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere with safe, sustainable and permanent storage (DACS), in geographically balanced locations. The Innovation Fund may also support breakthrough innovative technologies and infrastructure, including production of low- and zero-carbon fuels, to decarbonise the maritime, aviation, rail and road transport sectors, including collective forms of transport such as public transport and coach services.
For aviation, it may also support electrification and actions to reduce the overall climate impacts of aviation.
The Commission shall give special attention to projects in sectors covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to support innovation in low-carbon technologies, CCU, CCS, renewable energy and energy storage, in a way that contributes to mitigating climate change with the aim of awarding, over the period from 2021 to 2030, projects in those sectors a significant share of the equivalence in financial value of the allowances referred to in paragraph 1a, fourth subparagraph, of this Article. In addition, the Commission may launch, before 2027, calls for proposals dedicated to the sectors covered by that Regulation.
The Commission shall also give special attention to projects contributing to the decarbonisation of the maritime sector and shall include topics dedicated to that purpose in the Innovation Fund calls for proposals, where appropriate, including to electrify maritime transport, and to address its full climate impact, including black carbon emissions. Such calls for proposals shall also, in the criteria used for the selection of projects, take particular account of the potential for increasing biodiversity protection and for reducing noise and water pollution from projects and investments.
The Innovation Fund may in accordance with paragraph 8a support projects through competitive bidding, such as CDs, CCDs or fixed premium contracts to support decarbonisation technologies for which the carbon price might not be a sufficient incentive.
The Commission shall seek synergies between the Innovation Fund and Horizon Europe, in particular in relation to European partnerships, and shall, where relevant, seek synergies between the Innovation Fund and other Union programmes.
Projects in the territory of all Member States, including small-scale and medium-scale projects, shall be eligible, and, for maritime activities, projects with clear added value for the Union shall be eligible. Technologies receiving support shall be innovative and not yet commercially viable at a similar scale without support, but shall represent breakthrough solutions or be sufficiently mature for application on a pre-commercial scale.
The Commission shall ensure that the allowances destined for the Innovation Fund are auctioned in accordance with the principles and modalities referred to in Article 10(4) of this Directive. Proceeds from the auctioning shall constitute external assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*16). Budgetary commitments for actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down into annual instalments over several years.
The Commission shall, on request, provide technical assistance to Member States with low effective participation in projects under the Innovation Fund for the purpose of increasing the capacities of the requesting Member State to support the efforts of project proponents in their respective territories to submit applications for funding from the Innovation Fund, in order to improve the effective geographical participation in the Innovation Fund and increase the overall quality of submitted projects. The Commission shall pursue effective, quality-based geographical coverage in relation to funding from the Innovation Fund across the Union and shall ensure comprehensive monitoring of progress and appropriate follow-up in that respect.
Subject to the agreement of applicants, following the closure of a call for proposals, the Commission shall inform Member States of the applications for funding of projects in their respective territories and shall provide them with detailed information concerning those applications in order to facilitate Member States’ coordination of the support for projects. In addition, the Commission shall inform Member States about the list of pre-selected projects prior to the award of the support.
Projects shall be selected by means of a transparent selection procedure, in a technology-neutral manner in accordance with the objectives of the Innovation Fund as set out in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and on the basis of objective and transparent criteria, taking into account the extent to which projects provide a significant contribution to the Union’s climate and energy targets while contributing to the zero pollution and circularity objectives in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph, and, where relevant, the extent to which projects contribute to achieving emission reductions well below the benchmarks referred to in paragraph 2. Projects shall have the potential for widespread application or to significantly lower the costs of transitioning towards a climate-neutral economy in the sectors concerned. Priority shall be given to innovative technologies and processes addressing multiple environmental impacts. Projects involving CCU shall deliver a net reduction in emissions and ensure avoidance or permanent storage of CO2. In the case of grants provided through calls for proposals, up to 60 % of the relevant costs of projects may be supported, out of which up to 40 % need not be dependent on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, provided that pre-determined milestones, taking into account the technology deployed, are attained. In the case of support provided through competitive bidding and in the case of technical assistance support, up to 100 % of the relevant costs of projects may be supported. The potential for emission reductions in multiple sectors offered by combined projects, including in nearby areas, shall be taken into account in the criteria used for the selection of projects.
Projects funded by the Innovation Fund shall be required to share knowledge with other relevant projects as well as with Union-based researchers having a legitimate interest. The terms of knowledge sharing shall be defined by the Commission in calls for proposals.
The calls for proposals shall be open and transparent. In preparing the calls for proposals, the Commission shall strive to ensure that all sectors are duly covered. The Commission shall take measures to ensure that the calls are communicated as widely as possible, and especially to small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 to supplement this Directive concerning rules on the operation of the Innovation Fund, including the selection procedure and criteria, and the eligible sectors and technological requirements for the different types of support.
No project shall receive support via the mechanism under this paragraph that exceeds 15 % of the total number of allowances available for this purpose. Those allowances shall be taken into account under paragraph 7.
By 31 December 2023 and every year thereafter, the Commission shall report to the Climate Change Committee referred to in Article 22a(1) of this Directive, on the implementation of the Innovation Fund, providing an analysis of projects awarded funding, by sector and by Member State, and the expected contribution of those projects towards the objective of climate neutrality in the Union as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119. The Commission shall provide the report to the European Parliament and to the Council and shall make that report public.

the following paragraphs are inserted:
‘8a.   For CDs and CCDs awarded upon conclusion of a competitive bidding mechanism, appropriate coverage through budgetary commitments resulting from the proceeds of auctioning of allowances available in the Innovation Fund shall be provided and those budgetary commitments may be broken down into annual instalments over several years. For the first two rounds of the competitive bidding mechanism, coverage of the financial liability related to CDs and CCDs shall be fully ensured with appropriations resulting from the proceeds of auctioning of allowances allocated to the Innovation Fund pursuant to paragraph 8.
On the basis of a qualitative and quantitative assessment by the Commission of the financial risks arising from the implementation of CDs and CCDs, to be made after the conclusion of the first two rounds of the competitive bidding mechanism and each time it is necessary thereafter in accordance with the principle of prudence, whereby assets and profits are not to be overestimated and liabilities and losses are not to be underestimated, the Commission may, in accordance with the empowerment in the eighth subparagraph, decide to cover only part of the financial liability related to CDs and CCDs through the means referred to in the first subparagraph and the remaining part through other means. The Commission shall aim to limit the use of other means of coverage.
Where the assessment leads to the conclusion that other means of coverage are necessary to realise the full potential of the CDs and CCDs, the Commission shall aim for a balanced mix of other means of coverage. By way of derogation from Article 210(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, the Commission shall determine the extent of the use of other means of coverage pursuant to the delegated act provided for in the eighth subparagraph of this paragraph.
The remaining financial liability shall be sufficiently covered, having regard to the principles of Title X of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, if necessary, adapted to the specificities of CDs and CCDs, by way of derogation from Article 209(2), points (d) and (h), Article 210(1), Article 211(1), (2), (4) and (6), Articles 212, 213 and 214, Article 218(1) and Article 219(3) and (6) of that Regulation. Where applicable, other means of coverage, the provisioning rate and the necessary derogations shall be established in a delegated act provided for in the eighth subparagraph of this paragraph.
The Commission shall not use more than 30 % of the proceeds of the auctioning of allowances allocated to the Innovation Fund pursuant to paragraph 8 for provisioning for CDs and CCDs.
The provisioning rate shall be no lower than 50 % of the total financial liability borne by the Union budget for CDs and CCDs. When establishing the provisioning rate, the Commission shall take into account elements that may reduce the financial risks for the Union budget, beyond the appropriations available in the Innovation Fund, such as possible sharing of liability with Member States on a voluntary basis, or a possible re-insurance mechanism from the private sector. The Commission shall review the provisioning rate at least every three years from the date of application of the delegated act establishing it for the first time.
In order to avoid speculative applications, access to competitive bidding may be made conditional on the payment by applicants of a deposit to be forfeited in the event of non-fulfilment of the contract. Such forfeited deposits shall be used for the Innovation Fund as external assigned revenue pursuant to Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046. Any contribution paid to the granting authority by a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the CD or CCD where the reference price is higher than the strike price (‘reflows’) shall be used for the Innovation Fund as external assigned revenue pursuant to Article 21(5) of that Regulation.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 of this Directive to supplement this Directive in order to provide for and detail other means of coverage, if any, and, where applicable, the provisioning rate and the necessary additional derogations from Title X of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 as set out in the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph, and the rules on the operation of the competitive bidding mechanism, in particular in relation to deposits and reflows.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 to amend the fifth subparagraph of this paragraph by raising the limit of 30 % referred to in that subparagraph by no more than a total of 20 percentage points where necessary to respond to a demand for CDs and CCDs, taking into account the experience of the first rounds of the competitive bidding mechanism and considering the need to find an appropriate balance in the support from the Innovation Fund between grants and such contracts.
Financial support from the Innovation Fund shall be proportionate to the policy objectives set out in this Article and shall not lead to undue distortions of the internal market. To this end, support shall only be granted to cover additional costs or investment risks that cannot be borne by investors under normal market conditions.
8b.   40 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be allocated for free pursuant to this Article, and 10 million allowances from the quantity which could otherwise be auctioned pursuant to Article 10 of this Directive shall be made available for the Social Climate Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*17). The Commission shall ensure that the allowances destined for the Social Climate Fund are auctioned in 2025 in accordance with the principles and modalities referred to in Article 10(4) of this Directive and the delegated act adopted in accordance with that Article. The revenues from that auctioning shall constitute external assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, and shall be used in accordance with the rules applicable to the Social Climate Fund.

(*17)  Regulation (EU) 2023/955 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 establishing a Social Climate Fund and amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 (OJ L 130, 16.5.2023, p. 1).’;"

6.   When reviewing this Directive, in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the Commission shall analyse how linkages between the EU ETS and other carbon markets can be established without impeding the achievement of the climate-neutrality objective and the Union climate targets laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119.
7.   By 31 July 2026, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council in which it shall assess the feasibility of including municipal waste incineration installations in the EU ETS, including with a view to their inclusion from 2028 and with an assessment of the potential need for an option for a Member State to opt out until 31 December 2030. In that regard, the Commission shall take into account the importance of all sectors contributing to emission reductions and potential diversion of waste towards disposal by landfilling in the Union and waste exports to third countries. The Commission shall in addition take into account relevant criteria such as the effects on the internal market, potential distortions of competition, environmental integrity, alignment with the objectives of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (*19) and robustness and accuracy with regard to the monitoring and calculation of emissions. The Commission shall, where appropriate and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Directive, accompany that report with a legislative proposal to apply the provisions of this Chapter to greenhouse gas emissions permits and the allocation and issue of additional allowances in respect of municipal waste incineration installations, and to prevent potential diversion of waste.
In the report referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall also assess the possibility of including in the EU ETS other waste management processes, in particular landfills which create methane and nitrous oxide emissions in the Union. The Commission may, where appropriate, also accompany that report with a legislative proposal to include such other waste management processes in the EU ETS.

Article 30i
Review of this Chapter
By 1 January 2028, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter with regard to their effectiveness, administration and practical application, including on the application of the rules under Decision (EU) 2015/1814. Where appropriate, the Commission shall accompany that report with a legislative proposal to amend this Chapter. By 31 October 2031, the Commission shall assess the feasibility of integrating the sectors covered by Annex III to this Directive into the EU ETS covering the sectors listed in Annex I to this Directive.
Article 30j
Procedures for unilateral extension of the activity referred to in Annex III to other sectors not subject to Chapters II and III
1.   From 2027, Member States may extend the activity referred to in Annex III to sectors that are not listed in that Annex and thereby apply emissions trading in accordance with this Chapter in such sectors, taking into account all relevant criteria, in particular the effects on the internal market, potential distortions of competition, the environmental integrity of the emissions trading system established pursuant to this Chapter and the reliability of the planned monitoring and reporting system, provided that the extension of the activity referred to in that Annex is approved by the Commission.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 to supplement this Directive concerning the approval of an extension as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, authorisation for the issue of additional allowances and authorisation of other Member States to extend the activity referred to in Annex III. The Commission may also, when adopting such delegated acts, supplement the extension with further rules governing measures to address possible instances of double counting, including for the issue of additional allowances to compensate for allowances surrendered for use of fuels in activities listed in Annex I. Any financial measures by Member States in favour of companies in sectors and subsectors which are exposed to a genuine risk of carbon leakage, due to significant indirect costs that are incurred from greenhouse gas emission costs passed on in fuel prices due to the unilateral extension, shall be in accordance with State aid rules, and shall not cause undue distortions of competition in the internal market.
2.   Additional allowances issued pursuant to an authorisation under this Article shall be auctioned in line with the requirements laid down in Article 30d. Notwithstanding Article 30d(1) to (6), Member States having unilaterally extended the activity referred to in Annex III in accordance with this Article shall determine the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of those additional allowances.
Article 30k
Postponement of emissions trading for buildings, road transport and additional sectors until 2028 in the event of exceptionally high energy prices
