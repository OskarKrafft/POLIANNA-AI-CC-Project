Article 325 is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraphs 1 to 5 are replaced by the following:
‘1.   An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for all its trading book positions and all its non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk in accordance with the following approaches:
(a)
the alternative standardised approach set out in Chapter 1a;
(b)
the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b for those positions assigned to trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission by its competent authority to use that alternative approach as set out in Article 325az(1);
(c)
the simplified standardised approach referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, provided that the institution meets the conditions set out in Article 325a(1).
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution shall not calculate own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk for trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk where those positions are deducted from the institution’s own funds. The institution shall document its use of the derogation set out in this subparagraph, including its impact and materiality, and make the information available, upon request, to its competent authority.
2.   The own funds requirements for market risk calculated in accordance with the simplified standardised approach shall be the sum of the following own funds requirements, as applicable:
(a)
the own funds requirements for position risk referred to in Chapter 2, multiplied by:
(i)
1,3, for the general and specific risks of positions in debt instruments, excluding securitisation instruments as referred to in Article 337;
(ii)
3,5, for the general and specific risks of positions in equity instruments;
(b)
the own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk referred to in Chapter 3, multiplied by 1,2;
(c)
the own funds requirements for commodity risk referred to in Chapter 4, multiplied by 1,9;
(d)
the own funds requirements for securitisation instruments as referred to in Article 337.
3.   An institution using the alternative internal model approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk shall report to its competent authority the monthly calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk using the alternative standardised approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article for each trading desk to which those positions have been assigned in accordance with Article 104b.
4.   An institution may use a combination of the alternative standardised approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article and the alternative internal model approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article on a permanent basis, provided that the total own funds requirements for market risk calculated using the alternative internal model approach represent at least 10 % of the total own funds requirements for market risk. On an individual basis, an institution shall not use either of those approaches in combination with the simplified standardised approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (c), of this Article. At consolidated level, an institution may use a combination of those three approaches to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 325b(4), point (b), as long as the simplified standardised approach is not used in combination with the other two approaches within a single legal entity.
5.   An institution shall not use the alternative internal model approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), for instruments in its trading book that are securitisation positions or positions included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP) set out in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8.’
(b)
paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:

(c)
the following paragraphs are added:
‘3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, an institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the alternative standardised approach for the institution’s holdings of its own debt instruments as the sum of the two components referred to in paragraph 2, points (a) and (c). When calculating the own funds requirements for market risk for own debt instruments under the sensitivities-based method referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), the institution shall exclude from that calculation the risks from the institution’s own credit spread.
4.   Institutions shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and that reports directly to senior management. That risk control unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing the alternative standardised approach. It shall produce and analyse monthly reports on the output of the alternative standardised approach, as well as the appropriateness of the institution’s trading limits.

(a)
the internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article;

the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of the data sources used in the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk using the alternative standardised approach, including the independence of those data sources.
An institution shall conduct the review referred to in the first subparagraph at least once a year, or on a less frequent basis of up to every two years where the institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the size, systemic importance, nature, scale and complexity of its trading book business justifies a less frequent review.
7.   Competent authorities shall verify that the calculation referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, including the implementation by an institution of the requirements set out in this Chapter and in Article 325a, is performed with integrity.
8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the assessment methodology under which competent authorities conduct the verification referred to in paragraph 7;

Article 325j is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a position in a CIU using one of the following approaches:
(a)
an institution that meets the condition set out in Article 104(8), point (a), shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of that position by looking through the underlying positions of the CIU, on a monthly basis, as if those positions were directly held by the institution;
(b)
an institution that meets the condition set out in Article 104(8), point (b), shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of that position by using either of the following approaches:
(i)
it shall consider the position in the CIU as a single equity position allocated to the bucket “other sector” in Article 325ap(1), Table 8;
(ii)
it shall consider the limits set in the CIU’s mandate and in the relevant law.
For the purposes of the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph, point (b)(ii), of this paragraph the institution may calculate the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk and own funds requirements for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative positions of the CIU using the simplified approach set out in Article 132a(3).’

‘1a.   For the purposes of the approaches referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article the institution shall:
(a)
apply the own funds requirements for default risk set out in Section 5 and the residual risk add-on set out in Section 4 to a position in a CIU, where the mandate of that CIU allows it to invest in exposures that shall be subject to those own funds requirements; when using the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (b)(i), of this Article the institution shall consider the position in the CIU as a single unrated equity position allocated to the bucket “unrated” in Article 325y(1), Table 2; and
(b)
for all positions in the same CIU, use the same approach among the approaches set out in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article to calculate the own funds requirements on a stand-alone basis as a separate portfolio.’
(c)
paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 are replaced by the following:
‘3.   An institution may use a combination of the approaches referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), for its positions in CIUs. However, an institution shall use only one of those approaches for all positions in the same CIU.
4.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (b)(ii), of this Article an institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk by determining the hypothetical portfolio of the CIU that would attract the highest own funds requirements in accordance with Article 325c(2), point (a), based on the CIU’s mandate or relevant law, taking into account the leverage to the maximum extent, where applicable.
The institution shall use the same hypothetical portfolio as the one referred to in the first subparagraph to calculate, where applicable, the own funds requirements for default risk set out in Section 5 and the residual risk add-on set out in Section 4 to a position in a CIU.
The methodology developed by the institution to determine the hypothetical portfolios of all positions in CIUs for which the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph are used shall be approved by its competent authority.
5.   An institution may use the approaches referred to in paragraph 1 only where the CIU meets all of the conditions set out in Article 132(3). Where the CIU does not meet all of the conditions set out in Article 132(3), the institution shall assign its positions in that CIU to the non-trading book.
6.   To calculate the own funds requirements for market risk of a CIU position in accordance with the approach set out in paragraph 1, point (a), institutions may rely on a third party to perform such calculation, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the third party is one of the following:
(i)
the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;
(ii)
for CIUs not covered by point (i) of this point, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in Article 132(3), point (a);
(iii)
a third-party vendor on condition that the data, information or risk metrics are provided or calculated by the third parties referred to in point (i) or (ii) of this point or by another such third-party vendor;
(b)
the third party provides the institution with the data, information or risk metrics to calculate the own funds requirement for market risk of the CIU position in accordance with the approach referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article;
(c)
an external auditor of the institution has confirmed the adequacy of the third-party’s data, information or risk metrics referred to in point (b) of this paragraph and the institution’s competent authority has unrestricted access to those data, information or risk metrics upon request.
7.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the technical elements of the methodology to determine hypothetical portfolios for the purposes of the approach set out in paragraph 4, including the manner in which institutions are to take into account in the methodology, where applicable, leverage to the maximum extent.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 January 2027.

(a)
the institution has established a distinct unit which is responsible for the institution’s overall risk management and hedging of CVA risk;
(b)
for each counterparty concerned, the institution has developed a regulatory CVA model to calculate the CVA of that counterparty in accordance with Article 383a;
(c)
for each counterparty concerned, the institution is able to calculate, at least on a monthly basis, the sensitivities of its CVA to the risk factors concerned as determined in accordance with Article 383b;

(e)
the institution has established a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and the unit referred to in point (a) and that reports directly to the management body; that risk control unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing the standardised approach and shall produce and analyse monthly reports on the output of that approach and, moreover, the risk control unit shall assess the appropriateness of the institution’s trading limits and include the results of that assessment in its monthly reports; the risk control unit shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to fulfil its purpose.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), of this paragraph the sensitivity of a counterparty’s CVA to a risk factor means the relative change in the value of that CVA, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of that CVA, calculated using the institution’s regulatory CVA model in accordance with Articles 383i and 383j.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), of this paragraph the sensitivity of a position in an eligible hedge to a risk factor means the relative change in the value of that position, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of that position, calculated using the institution’s pricing model in accordance with Articles 383i and 383j.

3.   Institutions shall determine the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach as the sum of the following own funds requirements calculated in accordance with Article 383b:
(a)
the own funds requirements for delta risk which capture the risk of changes in the institution’s CVA portfolio due to movements in the relevant non-volatility related risk factors;

the following articles are inserted:
‘Article 383a

Regulatory CVA model
1.   A regulatory CVA model used for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with Article 383 shall be conceptually sound, implemented with integrity, and comply with all of the following requirements:
(a)
the regulatory CVA model is capable of modelling the CVA of a given counterparty, recognising netting and margin agreements at netting set level, where relevant, in accordance with this Article;
(b)
the institution estimates the counterparty’s probabilities of default from the counterparty credit spreads and market-consensus expected loss given default for that counterparty;
(c)
the expected loss given default referred to in point (a) shall be the same as the market-consensus expected loss given default referred to in point (b), unless the institution can demonstrate that the seniority of the portfolio of transactions with that counterparty differs from the seniority of senior unsecured bonds issued by that counterparty;
(d)
at each future time point, the simulated discounted future exposure of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty is calculated with an exposure model by repricing all transactions in that portfolio, based on the simulated joint changes of the market risk factors that are material to those transactions using an appropriate number of scenarios, and discounting the prices to the date of calculation using risk-free interest rates;
(e)
the regulatory CVA model is capable of modelling significant dependency between the simulated discounted future exposure of the portfolio of transactions and the counterparty credit spreads;
(f)
where the transactions of the portfolio are included in a netting set subject to a margin agreement and daily mark-to-market valuation, the collateral posted and received as part of that agreement is recognised as a risk mitigant in the simulated discounted future exposure, where all of the following conditions are met:
(i)
the institution determines the margin period of risk relevant for that netting set in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 285(2) and (5), and reflects that margin period in the calculation of the simulated discounted future exposure;
(ii)
all applicable features of the margin agreement, including the frequency of margin calls, the type of contractually eligible collateral, the threshold amounts, the minimum transfer amounts, the independent amounts and the initial margins for both the institution and the counterparty are appropriately reflected in the calculation of the simulated discounted future exposure;
(iii)
the institution has established a collateral management unit that complies with Article 287 for all collateral recognised for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), CVA shall have a positive sign and shall be calculated as a function of the counterparty’s expected loss given default, an appropriate set of the counterparty’s probabilities of default at future time points and an appropriate set of simulated discounted future exposures of the portfolio of transactions with that counterparty at future time points until the maturity of the longest transaction in that portfolio.
For the purposes of the demonstration referred to in the first subparagraph, point (c), collateral received from the counterparty shall not change the seniority of the exposure.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (f)(iii), of this paragraph where the institution has already established a collateral management unit for using the internal model method referred to in Article 283, the institution shall not be required to establish an additional collateral management unit where that institution demonstrates to its competent authority that such a unit complies with the requirements set out in Article 287 for the collateral recognised for calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the standardised approach.
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (b), where the credit default swap spreads of the counterparty are observable in the market, an institution shall use those spreads. Where such credit default swap spreads are not available, an institution shall use one of the following:
(a)
credit spreads from other instruments issued by the counterparty reflecting current market conditions;
(b)
proxy spreads that are appropriate considering the rating, industry and region of the counterparty.
3.   An institution using a regulatory CVA model shall comply with all of the following qualitative requirements:

the institution shall have an independent validation unit that is responsible for the effective initial and ongoing validation of the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article; that unit shall be independent from business credit and trading units, including the unit referred to in Article 383(1), point (a), and report directly to senior management; it shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to fulfil that purpose;
(d)
the senior management shall be actively involved in the risk control process and shall regard CVA risk control as an essential aspect of the business, to which appropriate resources need to be devoted;
(e)
the institution shall document the process for initial and ongoing validation of the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 to a level of detail that would enable a third party to understand how the models operate, their limitations, and their key assumptions, and recreate the analysis; that documentation shall set out the minimum frequency with which ongoing validation will be conducted, as well as other circumstances, such as a sudden change in market behaviour, under which additional validation shall be conducted; it shall describe how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios, what analyses are used and how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed;
(f)
the pricing models used in the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 for a given scenario of simulated market risk factors shall be tested against appropriate independent benchmarks for a wide range of market states as part of the initial and ongoing model validation process; pricing models for options shall account for the non-linearity of option value with respect to market risk factors;
(g)
an independent review of the institution’s internal CVA risk management system referred to in point (a) of this paragraph shall be carried out by the institution’s internal auditing process on a regular basis; that review shall include the activities both of the unit referred to in Article 383(1), point (a), and of the independent validation unit referred to in point (c) of this paragraph;
(h)
the regulatory CVA model used by the institution for calculating the simulated discounted future exposure referred to in paragraph 1, shall reflect transaction terms and specifications and margin agreements in a timely, complete, and conservative manner; the terms and specifications shall reside in a secure database subject to formal and periodic audit; the transmission of transaction terms and specifications data and margin agreements to the exposure model shall also be subject to internal audit, and formal reconciliation processes shall be in place between the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms, specifications and margin agreements are being reflected in the exposure system correctly or, at least, conservatively;
(i)
the current and historical market data inputs used in the model by the institution for calculating the simulated discounted future exposure referred to in paragraph 1 shall be acquired independently of the business lines and fed into that model in a timely and complete manner and maintained in a secure database subject to formal and periodic audit; an institution shall have a well-developed data integrity process to handle inappropriate data observations; where the model relies on proxy market data, an institution shall design internal policies to identify suitable proxies and shall demonstrate empirically on an ongoing basis that the proxies provide a conservative representation of the underlying risk;
(j)
the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 shall capture the transaction specific and contractual information necessary in order to aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set; an institution shall verify that transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model.
For the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for CVA risk, the exposure model referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may have different specifications and assumptions in order to meet all requirements laid down in Article 383a, except that its market data inputs and netting recognition shall remain the same as the ones used for accounting purposes.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:

(c)
which other instruments referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), are appropriate to estimate the counterparty’s probabilities of default and how institutions are to make that estimate.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2027.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

Article 383b
Own funds requirements for delta and vega risks
1.   Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in Articles 383c to 383h, and the process set out in paragraphs 2 to 8 of this Article, to calculate the own funds requirements for delta and vega risks.
2.   For each risk class referred to in Article 383(2), the sensitivity of the aggregate CVAs and the sensitivity of all positions in eligible hedges falling within the scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risk to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulae set out in Articles 383i and 383j. Where the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor.
For the calculation of the vega risk sensitivities of the aggregate CVAs, sensitivities both to volatilities used in the exposure model to simulate risk factors and to volatilities used to reprice option transactions in the portfolio with the counterparty shall be included.
By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, subject to the permission of the competent authority, an institution may use alternative definitions of delta and vega risk sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets all of the following conditions:
(a)
those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes or for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;
(b)
the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities of the position than the formulae set out in Articles 383i and 383j, and that the resulting delta and vega risk sensitivities do not materially differ from the ones obtained applying the formulae set out in Articles 383i and 383j, respectively.
3.   Where an eligible hedge is an index instrument, institutions shall calculate the sensitivities of that eligible hedge to all relevant risk factors by applying the shift of one of the relevant risk factors to each of the index constituents.
4.   An institution may introduce additional risk factors that correspond to qualified index instruments for the following risk classes:
(a)
counterparty credit spread risk;
(b)
reference credit spread risk; and
(c)
equity risk.
For the purposes of delta risks, an index instrument shall be considered qualified where it meets the conditions set out in Article 325i. For vega risks, all index instruments shall be considered qualified.
An institution shall calculate sensitivities of CVA and eligible hedges to qualified index risk factors in addition to sensitivities to the non-index risk factors.
An institution shall calculate delta and vega risk sensitivities to a qualified index risk factor as a single sensitivity to the underlying qualified index. Where 75 % of the constituents of a qualified index are mapped to the same sector as set out in Articles 383p, 383s and 383v, the institution shall map the qualified index to that same sector. Otherwise, the institution shall map the sensitivity to the applicable qualified index bucket.
5.   The weighted sensitivities of the aggregate CVA and of the market value of all eligible hedges to each risk factor shall be calculated by multiplying the respective net sensitivities by the corresponding risk weight, in accordance with the following formulae:










where:

k

= the index that denotes the risk factor k;





= the weighted sensitivity of the aggregate CVA to risk factor k;

RWk


= the risk weight applicable to the risk factor k;





= the net sensitivity of the aggregate CVA to risk factor k;





= the weighted sensitivity of the market value of all eligible hedges in the CVA portfolio to risk factor k;





= the net sensitivity of the market value of all eligible hedges in the CVA portfolio to risk factor k.
6.   Institutions shall calculate the net-weighted sensitivity WSk
 of the CVA portfolio to risk factor k in accordance with the following formula:





7.   The net-weighted sensitivities within the same bucket shall be aggregated in accordance with the following formula, using the corresponding correlations ρkl
 to weighted sensitivities within the same bucket set out in Articles 383l, 383t and 383q giving rise to the bucket-specific sensitivity Kb
:





where:

Kb


= the bucket-specific sensitivity of bucket b;

WSk


= the net-weighted sensitivities;

ρkl


= the corresponding intra-bucket correlation parameters;

R

= the hedging disallowance parameter equal to 0,01.
8.   The bucket-specific sensitivity shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of this Article for each bucket within a risk class. Once the bucket-specific sensitivity has been calculated for all buckets, weighted sensitivities to all risk factors across buckets shall be aggregated in accordance with the following formula, using the corresponding correlations γbc
 for weighted sensitivities in different buckets set out in Articles 383l, 383o, 383r, 383u, 383w and 383z giving rise to the risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta or vega risk:





where:

mCVA


= a multiplier factor which is equal to 1; the competent authority may increase the value of mCVA
 where the institution’s regulatory CVA model shows deficiencies preventing the appropriate measurement of the own funds requirements for CVA risk;

Kb


= the bucket-specific sensitivity of bucket b;

γbc


= the correlation parameter between buckets b and c;





for all risk factors in bucket b;





for all risk factors in bucket c.

‘Article 384

Basic approach
1.   An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article, as applicable, for a portfolio of transactions with one or more counterparties by using one of the following formulae, as appropriate:
(a)
the formula set out in paragraph 2 of this Article, where the institution includes in the calculation one or more eligible hedges recognised in accordance with Article 386;
(b)
the formula set out in paragraph 3 of this Article, where the institution does not include in the calculation any eligible hedges recognised in accordance with Article 386.
The approaches set out in the first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), shall not be used in combination.
2.   An institution that meets the condition referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk as follows:

BACVAtotal = β ∙ BACVAcsr–unhedged + DSCVA ∙ (1 – β) ∙ BACVAcsr–hedged


where:

BACVAtotal


= the own funds requirements for CVA risk under the basic approach;

BACVAcsr–unhedged


= the own funds requirements for CVA risk under the basic approach as calculated in accordance with paragraph 3 for an institution that meets the condition set out in paragraph 1, point (b);

DSCVA


= 0,65;

β

= 0,25;





where:

h
= the index that denotes all single-name instruments recognised as eligible hedges in accordance with Article 386 for a given counterparty for which the institution calculates the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the approach laid down in this Article;
I
= the index that denotes all index instruments recognised as eligible hedges in accordance with Article 386 for all counterparties for which the institution calculates the own funds requirements for CVA risk using the approach laid down in this Article;

RWc


= the risk weight applicable to counterparty c; counterparty c shall be mapped to one of the risk weights based on a combination of sector and credit quality and determined in accordance with Table 1.
Where there are no external ratings for a specific counterparty, institutions may, subject to approval by the competent authorities, map the internal rating to a corresponding external rating and assign a risk weight corresponding to either credit quality step 1 to 3 or credit quality step 4 to 6; otherwise, the risk weights for unrated exposures shall be applied.



= the effective maturity for the netting set NS with counterparty c;



shall be calculated in accordance with Article 162; however, for that calculation, 

 shall not be capped at five years, but at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set;





= the counterparty credit risk exposure value of the netting set NS with counterparty c, including the effect of collateral in accordance with the methods set out in Title II, Chapter 6, Sections 3 to 6, as applicable to the calculation of the own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk referred to in Article 92(4), points (a) and (g);





= the supervisory discount factor for the netting set NS with counterparty c.
For an institution, using the methods set out in Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6, the supervisory discount factor shall be set at 1; in all other cases, the supervisory discount factor shall be calculated as follows:






rhc


= the supervisory correlation factor between the credit spread risk of counterparty c and the credit spread risk of a single-name instrument recognised as an eligible hedge h for counterparty c, determined in accordance with Table 2;





= the residual maturity of a single-name instrument recognised as an eligible hedge;





= the notional of a single name instrument recognised as an eligible hedge;





= the supervisory discount factor for a single name instrument recognised as an eligible hedge, calculated as follows:










= the supervisory risk weight of a single-name instrument recognised as an eligible hedge; those risk weights shall be based on a combination of sector and credit quality of the reference credit spread of the hedging instrument and determined in accordance with Table 1;





= the residual maturity of one or more positions in the same index instrument recognised as an eligible hedge; in the case of more than one position in the same index instrument, 

 shall be the notional-weighted maturity of all those positions;





= the full notional of one or more positions in the same index instrument recognised as an eligible hedge;





= the supervisory discount factor for one or more positions in the same index instrument recognised as an eligible hedge, calculated as follows:










= the supervisory risk weight of an index instrument recognised as an eligible hedge; 

 shall be based on a combination of sector and credit quality of all index constituents, calculated as follows:

Prudential treatment of exposures to environmental or social factors
1.   EBA, after consulting the ESRB, shall, on the basis of available data, assess whether the dedicated prudential treatment of exposures related to assets or liabilities, subject to the impact of environmental or social factors is to be adjusted. In particular, EBA shall assess:
(a)
the availability and accessibility of reliable and consistent ESG data for each exposure class determined in accordance with Part Three, Title II;
(b)
in consultation with EIOPA, the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify the exposures, for each exposure class determined in accordance with Part Three, Title II, based on a common set of principles to ESG risk classification, using the information on transition risk and physical risk indicators made available by sustainability disclosure reporting frameworks adopted in the Union and where available internationally, the guidance and conclusions coming from the supervisory stress-testing or scenario analysis of climate-related financial risks conducted by EBA or the competent authorities and if appropriately reflecting the ESG risks, the relevant ESG score of the credit risk rating by a nominated ECAI;

Transitional provisions on the prudential treatment of crypto-assets
1.   By 30 June 2025, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council to introduce a dedicated prudential treatment for crypto-asset exposures, taking into account the international standards and Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. That legislative proposal shall include the following:
(a)
criteria for assigning crypto-assets to different crypto-asset categories based on their risk characteristics and compliance with specific conditions;
(b)
specific own funds requirements for all risks entailed by different crypto-assets;
(c)
an aggregate limit for exposures to specific types of crypto-assets;
(d)
specific leverage ratio requirements for crypto-asset exposures;
(e)
specific supervisory powers as regards crypto-asset exposure assignment, monitoring and calculation of the own funds requirements;
(f)
specific liquidity requirements for crypto-asset exposures;
(g)
disclosure and reporting requirements.
2.   Until the date of application of the legislative act referred to in paragraph 1, institutions shall calculate their own funds requirements for crypto-asset exposures as follows:
(a)
crypto-asset exposures to tokenised traditional assets shall be treated as exposures to the traditional assets that they represent;
(b)
exposures to asset-referenced tokens whose issuers comply with Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and that reference one or more traditional assets shall be assigned a risk weight of 250 %;
(c)
crypto-asset exposures other than those referred to in points (a) and (b) shall be assigned a risk weight of 1 250 %.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, point (a), crypto-asset exposures to tokenised traditional assets whose values depend on any other crypto-assets shall be assigned to point (c).
3.   The value of an institution’s total exposure to crypto-assets other than those referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), shall not exceed 1 % of the institution’s Tier 1 capital.
4.   An institution that exceeds the limit set out in paragraph 3 shall immediately notify the competent authority of the breach and shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority a timely return to compliance.
5.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical elements necessary for institutions to calculate their own funds requirements in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraph 2, points (b) and (c), including how to calculate the value of the exposures and how to aggregate short and long exposures for the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3.
In developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into consideration the related internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS as well as existing authorisations in the Union under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
6.   For the calculation of their own funds requirements for crypto-asset exposures, institutions shall not apply the deduction referred to in Article 36(1), point (b).’

By 30 June 2024, EBA shall, in close cooperation with EIOPA, report to the Commission on the eligibility and use of credit insurance policy as a credit risk mitigation technique, including on:
(a)
the appropriateness of the associated risk parameters referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapters 3 and 4;
(b)
an analysis of the effective and observed riskiness of credit risk exposures where a credit insurance was recognised as a credit risk mitigation technique;

Credit risk — interaction between Common Equity Tier 1 capital reductions and credit risk parameters
By 31 December 2026, EBA shall report to the Commission on the consistency between the current measurement of credit risk and the individual credit risk parameters and on the treatment of any adjustments for the purpose of the computation of the IRB shortfall or IRB excess as referred to in Article 159, and on its consistency with the determination of the exposure value in accordance with Article 166 and with the estimation of LGD.
That report shall consider the maximum possible economic loss arising from a default event along with its achieved coverage in terms of Common Equity Tier 1 capital reductions, taking into account any accounting-based Common Equity Tier 1 capital reductions, including from expected credit losses or fair value adjustments, and any discounts on received exposures, and their implications for regulatory deductions.

Prudential treatment of securitisation
1.   By 31 December 2026, EBA, in close collaboration with ESMA, shall report to the Commission on the prudential treatment of securitisation transactions, differentiating between different types of securitisations, including synthetic securitisations, between originators and investors, and between STS and non-STS transactions.
2.   In particular, EBA shall monitor the use of the transitional arrangement referred to in Article 465(13) and assess the extent to which the application of the output floor to securitisation exposures would affect the capital reduction obtained by originator institutions in transactions for which a significant risk transfer has been recognised, would excessively reduce the risk sensitivity and would affect the economic viability of new securitisation transactions. In such cases of a reduction of risk sensitivities, EBA may consider proposing a downward recalibration of the non-neutrality factors for transactions for which a significant risk transfer has been recognised. EBA shall also assess the appropriateness of the non-neutrality factors under both the SEC-SA and the SEC-IRBA, taking into account the historic credit performance of securitisation transactions in the Union and the reduced model and agency risks of the securitisation framework.
3.   On the basis of the report referred to in paragraph 1 and taking into account related internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal by 31 December 2027.

(b)
the regulatory treatment applicable under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4, to portfolio guarantees where those do not qualify as a securitisation;
(c)
the application of the requirements set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 5, of this Regulation and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 for portfolio guarantees where those guarantees qualify as a securitisation;
(d)
the application of Article 234 for single guarantees that lead to tranching.
2.   In the report referred to in paragraph 1, EBA shall assess in particular the following:
(a)
in relation to paragraph 1, point (a), the conditions under which portfolio guarantees give rise to a tranched transfer of risk;
(b)
in relation to paragraph 1, point (b):
(i)
the relevant eligibility criteria of portfolio guarantees under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4;

Prudential treatment of securities financing transactions
By 10 July 2026, EBA shall report to the Commission on the impact of the new framework for securities financing transactions in terms of own funds requirements attributed to the corresponding securities financing transactions which are by nature very short-term activities, with a particular focus on its possible impact on sovereign debt markets in terms of market making capacity and cost.
EBA shall assess whether a recalibration of the associated risk weights in the standardised approach is appropriate, given the associated risks with respect to short-term maturities, specifically for residual maturities below one year.
On the basis of that report, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal by 31 December 2027.’

1.   EBA, in close cooperation with ESMA, shall, by 10 January 2027, report to the Commission on the appropriateness of implementing in Union law the minimum haircut floor framework for securities financing transactions to address the potential build-up of leverage outside the banking sector.
2.   The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall consider all of the following:
(a)
the degree of leverage outside the banking system in the Union and the extent to which the minimum haircut floor framework could reduce that leverage if it became excessive;
(b)
the materiality of the securities financing transactions held by institutions in the Union that are subject to the minimum haircut floor framework, including the breakdown of those securities financing transactions which do not comply with the minimum haircut floors;
(c)
the estimated impact of the minimum haircut floor framework for institutions in the Union under the two implementation approaches recommended by the Financial Stability Board, namely a market regulation or more punitive own funds requirement under this Regulation, under a scenario in which institutions in the Union would not adjust haircuts to their securities financing transactions to comply with minimum haircut floors, and the estimated impact of the minimum haircut floor framework under an alternative scenario in which institutions in the Union would adjust those haircuts to comply with minimum haircut floors;
(d)
the main drivers behind those estimated impacts, as well as the potential unintended consequences of introducing a minimum haircut floor framework on the functioning of the securities financing transaction markets in the Union;
(e)
the implementation approach that would be most effective in meeting the regulatory objectives of the minimum haircut floor framework in light of the considerations referred to in points (a) to (d) and taking into account the level playing field across the financial sector in the Union.

By 10 January 2028, EBA shall report to the Commission on the following:
(a)
the use of insurance in the context of the calculation of the own funds requirement for operational risk;
(b)
whether the recognition of insurance recoveries might lead to regulatory arbitrage by reducing the annual operational risk loss without a commensurate reduction in the actual operational loss exposure;
(c)
whether the recognition of insurance recoveries has a different impact on the appropriate coverage of recurring losses and of potential tail losses;
(d)

assessing those requirements also in relation to banking groups and specific business models;
(b)
taking into account the relevance of small and non-complex institutions at institution level and by region for maintaining financial stability and credit provision in local communities.
In considering options for changes in the prudential framework, EBA shall base itself on the overarching principle that any simplified requirements are to be more conservative.
