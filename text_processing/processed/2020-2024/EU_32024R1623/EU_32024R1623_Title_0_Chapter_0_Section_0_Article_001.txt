Inclusion in the trading book

(a)
instruments that meet the criteria set out in Article 325(6), (7) and (8), for the inclusion in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP);
(b)
instruments that would give rise to a net short credit or net short equity position in the non-trading book, with the exception of the own liabilities of the institution, unless such positions meet the criteria referred to in point (e);
(c)
instruments resulting from securities underwriting commitments, where those underwriting commitments relate only to securities that are expected to be purchased by the institution on the settlement date;

An institution shall have a net short credit position where the credit spread increase, or the deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuer or group of issuers, results in a profit for the institution. Institutions shall continuously monitor whether instruments give rise to a net short credit or net short equity position in the non-trading book.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (i), an institution shall split the embedded option, or other derivative, from its own liability in the non-trading book that relates to credit risk or equity risk. It shall assign the embedded option, or other derivative, to the trading book and shall leave the own liability in the non-trading book. Where, due to its nature, it is not possible to split the instrument, an institution shall assign the whole instrument to the trading book.

Use of credit risk mitigation techniques under the Standardised Approach and the IRB Approach for credit risk and dilution risk
1.   For an exposure to which an institution applies the Standardised Approach under Chapter 2 or applies the IRB Approach under Chapter 3 but without using its own estimates of LGD under Article 143, the institution may take into account the effect of funded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 4 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g) and, where relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 36(1), point (d), and Article 62, point (d).
2.   For an exposure to which an institution applies the IRB Approach by using its own estimates of LGD under Article 143, the institution may take into account the effect of funded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 3 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g), and, where relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 36(1), point (d), and Article 62, point (d).
3.   Where an institution applies the IRB Approach by using its own estimates of LGD under Article 143 for both the original exposure and for comparable direct exposures to the protection provider, the institution may take into account the effect of unfunded credit protection in accordance with Chapter 3 in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), points (a) and (g), and, where relevant, expected loss amounts for the purposes of the calculation referred to in Article 36(1), point (d), and Article 62, point (d).

4.   Subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 5, institutions may regard loans to natural persons as exposures secured by a mortgage on residential property, instead of being treated as guaranteed exposures, for the purposes of Title II, Chapters 2, 3 and 4, as applicable, where in a Member State the following conditions for those loans have been fulfilled:
(a)
the majority of loans to natural persons for the purchase of residential properties in that Member State are not provided as mortgages in legal form;
(b)
the majority of loans to natural persons for the purchase of residential properties in that Member State are guaranteed by a protection provider with a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI corresponding to credit quality step 1 or 2, that is required to repay the institution in full where the original borrower defaults;
(c)
the institution has the legal right to take a mortgage on the residential property in the event that the protection provider referred to in point (b) does not meet or becomes unable to meet its obligations under the guarantee provided.
Competent authorities shall inform EBA where the conditions set out in the first subparagraph, points (a), (b) and (c), of this paragraph are met in the national territories of their jurisdictions, and shall provide the names of protection providers eligible for that treatment that fulfil the conditions of this paragraph and paragraph 5.
EBA shall publish the list of all such eligible protection providers on its website and update that list yearly.
5.   For the purposes of paragraph 4, loans referred to in that paragraph may be treated as exposures secured by a mortgage on residential property, instead of being treated as guaranteed exposures, where all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
for an exposure that is treated under the Standardised Approach, the exposure meets all of the requirements to be assigned to the Standardised Approach “exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property” exposure class pursuant to Articles 124 and 125 with the exception that the institution granting the loan does not hold a mortgage over the residential property;
(b)
for an exposure that is treated under the IRB Approach, the exposure meets all of the requirements to be assigned to the IRB exposure class “retail exposures secured by residential property” referred to in Article 147(2), point (d)(ii), with the exception that the institution granting the loan does not hold a mortgage over the residential property;
(c)
there is no mortgage lien on the residential property when the loan is granted and for the loans granted from 1 January 2014 the borrower is contractually committed not to grant any mortgage lien without the consent of the institution that originally granted the loan;
(d)
the protection provider is an eligible protection provider as referred to in Article 201, and has a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI corresponding to credit quality step 1 or 2;
(e)
the protection provider is an institution or a financial sector entity subject to own funds requirements comparable to those applicable to institutions or insurance undertakings;
(f)
the protection provider has established a fully-funded mutual guarantee fund or equivalent protection for insurance undertakings to absorb credit risk losses, the calibration of which is periodically reviewed by its competent authority and is subject to periodic stress testing, at least every two years;
(g)
the institution is contractually and legally empowered to take a mortgage on the residential property in the event that the protection provider does not meet or becomes unable to meet its obligations under the guarantee provided.
6.   Institutions that use the option provided for in paragraph 4 for a given eligible protection provider under the mechanism referred to in that paragraph shall do so for all its exposures to natural persons guaranteed by that protection provider under that mechanism.’

(3)
the project to which the exposure is related generates cash flows that are predictable and cover all future loan repayments;
(4)
where the revenues of the obligor are not funded by payments from a large number of users, the source of repayment of the obligation depends on one main counterparty and that main counterparty is one of the following:
—
a central bank, a central government, a regional government or a local authority, provided that they are assigned a risk weight of 0 % in accordance with Articles 114 and 115, or are assigned an ECAI rating with a credit quality step of at least 3 by a recognised ECAI; or, in the case of institutions calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in accordance with Chapter 3, where the central bank, central government, regional government or local authority do not have a credit assessment by a recognised ECAI, they are assigned with an internal credit rating equivalent to a credit quality step of at least 3 by the institution, provided that they are internally rated by the institution in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3, Section 6;

(d)
for the purposes of point (c)(ii)(3), the cash flows generated shall not be considered predictable unless a substantial part of the revenues satisfies one or more of the following conditions:
(i)
the revenues are availability-based, meaning that, once construction is completed, the obligor is entitled, as long as the contractual conditions are fulfilled, to payments from its contractual counterparties which cover operating and maintenance costs, debt service costs and equity returns as the obligor operates the project, and those payments are not subject to swings in demand, such as traffic levels, and are adjusted typically only for lack of performance or lack of availability of the asset to the public;
(ii)
the revenues are subject to a rate-of-return regulation;
(iii)
the revenues are subject to a take-or-pay contract;
(e)
for the purposes of point (c), the operational phase shall mean the phase in which the entity that was specifically created to finance the project, or that is economically comparable, meets both of the following conditions:

the entity has a positive net cash flow that is sufficient to cover any remaining contractual obligation;
(ii)
the entity has a declining long term debt.
4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions under which the criteria set out in paragraph 3, point (c)(ii), are met.

Retail exposures
1.   Exposures that comply with all of the following criteria shall be considered retail exposures:
(a)
the exposure is to one or more natural persons or to an SME;
(b)
the total amount owed to the institution, its parent undertakings and its subsidiaries, by the obligor or group of connected clients, including any exposure in default but excluding exposures secured by residential property, up to the property value shall not, to the knowledge of the institution, which shall take reasonable steps to confirm the situation, exceed EUR 1 million;
(c)
the exposure represents one of a significant number of exposures with similar characteristics, such that the risks associated with such exposure are substantially reduced;
(d)
the institution concerned treats the exposure in its risk management framework and manages the exposure internally as a retail exposure consistently over time and in a manner that is similar to the treatment by the institution of other retail exposures.
The present value of retail minimum lease payments shall be eligible for the retail exposure class.
By 10 July 2025, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to specify proportionate diversification methods under which an exposure is to be considered as one of a significant number of similar exposures as specified in the first subparagraph, point (c), of this paragraph.
2.   The following exposures shall not be considered to be retail exposures:
(a)
non-debt exposures conveying a subordinated, residual claim on the assets or income of the issuer;
(b)
debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives, or other vehicles, the economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (a);
(c)
all other exposures in the form of securities.
3.   Retail exposures as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be assigned a risk weight of 75 %, with the exception of transactor exposures, which shall be assigned a risk weight of 45 %.
4.   Where any of the criteria referred to in paragraph 1 are not met for an exposure to one or more natural persons, the exposure shall be considered a retail exposure and shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, exposures due to loans granted by an institution to pensioners or employees with a permanent contract against the unconditional transfer of part of the borrower’s pension or salary to that institution shall be assigned a risk weight of 35 %, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
to repay the loan, the borrower unconditionally authorises the pension fund or employer to make direct payments to the institution by deducting the monthly payments on the loan from the borrower’s monthly pension or salary;
(b)
the risks of death, inability to work, unemployment or reduction of the net monthly pension or salary of the borrower are properly covered through an insurance policy to the benefit of the institution;
(c)
the monthly payments to be made by the borrower on all loans that meet the conditions set out in points (a) and (b) do not in aggregate exceed 20 % of the borrower’s net monthly pension or salary;
(d)
the maximum original maturity of the loan is equal to or less than 10 years.’

the following article is inserted:
‘Article 123a

Exposures with a currency mismatch
1.   For exposures to natural persons that are assigned to the exposure class referred to in Article 112, point (h), or for exposures to natural persons that qualify as exposures secured by mortgages on residential property that are assigned to the exposure class referred to in Article 112, point (i), the risk weight assigned in accordance with this Chapter shall be multiplied by a factor of 1,5, whereby the resulting risk weight shall not be higher than 150 %, where the following conditions are met:
(a)
the exposure is denominated in a currency which is different from the currency of the obligor’s source of income;
(b)
the obligor does not have a hedge for its payment risk due to the currency mismatch, either by a financial instrument or foreign currency income that matches the currency of the exposure, or the total of such hedges available to the borrower covers less than 90 % of each instalment for this exposure.
Where an institution is unable to single out those exposures with a currency mismatch, the risk weight multiplier of 1,5 shall apply to all unhedged exposures where the currency of the exposures is different from the domestic currency of the country of residence of the obligor.
2.   For the purposes of this Article, source of income refers to any source that generates cash flows to the obligor, including from remittances, rental incomes or salaries, whilst excluding proceeds from selling assets or similar recourse actions by the institution.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where the pair of currencies referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), is composed of the euro and the currency of a Member State participating in the second stage of economic and monetary union (ERM II), the risk weight multiplier of 1,5 shall not apply.’

Articles 124, 125 and 126 are replaced by the following:
‘Article 124

Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property
1.   A non-ADC exposure that does not meet all of the conditions set out in paragraph 3, or any part of a non-ADC exposure that exceeds the nominal amount of the lien on the property, shall be treated as follows:
(a)
a non-IPRE exposure shall be risk weighted as an exposure to the counterparty that is not secured by the immovable property concerned;
(b)
an IPRE exposure shall be assigned a risk weight of 150 %.
2.   A non-ADC exposure, up to the nominal amount of the lien on the property, where all of the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article are met, shall be treated as follows:
(a)
where the exposure is secured by a residential property,
(i)
a non-IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 125(1):
(ii)
an IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 125(1) where it meets any of the following conditions:
(1)
the immovable property securing the exposure is the obligor’s primary residence, either where the immovable property as a whole constitutes a single housing unit or where the immovable property securing the exposure is a housing unit that is a separated part within the immovable property;
(2)
the exposure is to a natural person and is secured by an income-producing residential housing unit, either where the immovable property as a whole constitutes a single housing unit or where the housing unit is a separated part within the immovable property, and total exposures of the institution to that natural person are not secured by more than four immovable properties, including those which are not residential properties or which do not meet any of the criteria set out in this point, or separate housing units within immovable properties;
(3)
the exposure is to associations or cooperatives of natural persons that are regulated by national law and exist with the sole purpose of granting their members the use of a primary residence in the property securing the loan;
(4)
the exposure is to public housing companies or not-for-profit associations that are regulated by law and exist to serve social purposes and to offer tenants long-term housing;
(iii)
an IPRE exposure which does not meet any of the conditions set out in point (ii) of this point, shall be treated in accordance with Article 125(2);
(b)
where the exposure is secured by commercial immovable property, it shall be treated as follows:
(i)
a non-IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 126(1);
(ii)
an IPRE exposure shall be treated in accordance with Article 126(2).
3.   In order to be eligible for the treatment referred to in paragraph 2, an exposure secured by an immovable property shall fulfil all of the following conditions:
(a)
the immovable property securing the exposure meets any of the following conditions:
(i)
the immovable property has been fully completed;
(ii)
the immovable property is forest or agricultural land;
(iii)
the lending is to a natural person and the immovable property is either a residential property under construction or it is land upon which a residential property is planned to be constructed where that plan has been legally approved by all relevant authorities, as applicable, and where any of the following conditions is met:
(1)
the immovable property does not have more than four residential housing units and will be the primary residence of the obligor and the lending to the natural person is not indirectly financing ADC exposures;
(2)
a central government, regional government or local authority or a public sector entity is involved, exposures to which are treated in accordance with Article 115(2) or Article 116(4), respectively, and has the legal powers and ability to ensure that the property under construction will be finished within a reasonable time frame and is required, or has committed in a legally binding manner, to ensure completion where the construction would otherwise not be finished within such reasonable time frame; alternatively, there is an equivalent legal mechanism in place to ensure that the property under construction is completed within a reasonable timeframe;
(b)
the exposure is secured by a first lien held by the institution on the immovable property, or the institution holds the first lien and any sequentially lower ranking lien on that property;
(c)
the property value is not materially dependent upon the credit quality of the obligor;
(d)
all information required at origination of the exposure and for monitoring purposes is properly documented, including information on the ability of the obligor to repay and on the valuation of the property;
(e)

For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), institutions may exclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the property value and the performance of the obligor.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (d), institutions shall put in place underwriting policies with respect to the origination of exposures secured by immovable property that include the assessment of the ability of the borrower to repay. The underwriting policies shall include the relevant metrics for that assessment and their respective maximum levels.
4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, point (b), in jurisdictions where junior liens provide the holder with a claim on collateral that is legally enforceable and constitutes an effective credit risk mitigant, junior liens held by an institution other than the one holding the senior lien may also be recognised, including where the institution does not hold the senior lien or does not hold a lien ranking between a more senior lien and a more junior lien both held by the institution.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the rules governing the liens shall ensure all of the following:
(a)
each institution holding a lien on a property can initiate the sale of the property independently from other entities holding a lien on the property;
(b)
where the sale of the property is not carried out by means of a public auction, entities holding a senior lien take reasonable steps to obtain a fair market value or the best price that may be obtained in the circumstances when exercising any power of sale on their own.
5.   For the purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for undrawn facilities, liens that satisfy all eligibility requirements set out in paragraph 3 and, where applicable, paragraph 4, may be recognised where drawing under the facility is conditional on the prior or simultaneous filing of a lien to the extent of the institution’s interest in the lien once the facility is drawn, such that the institution does not have any interest in the lien to the extent that the facility is not drawn.
6.   For the purposes of Article 125(2) and Article 126(2), the exposure-to-value (“ETV”) ratio shall be calculated by dividing the gross exposure amount by the property value subject to the following conditions:
(a)
the gross exposure amount shall be calculated as the accounting value of the asset item related to the exposure secured by immovable property and any undrawn but committed amount that, once drawn, would increase the exposure value of the exposure which is secured by immovable property; that gross exposure amount shall be calculated without taking into account:
(i)
specific credit risk adjustments in accordance with Article 110;
(ii)
additional value adjustments in accordance with Article 34 related to the non-trading book business of the institution;
(iii)
amounts deducted in accordance with Article 36(1), point (m); and
(iv)
other own funds reductions related to the asset item;
(b)
the gross exposure amount shall be calculated without taking into account any type of funded or unfunded credit protection, except for pledged deposits accounts with the lending institution that meet all requirements for on-balance-sheet netting, either under master netting agreements in accordance with Articles 196 and 206 or under other on-balance-sheet netting agreements in accordance with Articles 195 and 205 and have been unconditionally and irrevocably pledged for the sole purpose of fulfilling the credit obligation related to the exposure secured by immovable property;
(c)
for exposures that are required to be treated in accordance with Article 125(2) or Article 126(2) where a party other than the institution holds a senior lien and a junior lien held by the institution is recognised under paragraph 4 of this Article, the gross exposure amount shall be calculated as the sum of the gross exposure amount of the lien held by the institution and of the gross exposure amounts for all other liens of equal or higher ranking seniority than the lien held by the institution.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (a), where an institution has more than one exposure secured by the same immovable property and those exposures are secured by liens on that immovable property that are sequential in ranking order without any lien held by a third party ranking in-between, the exposures shall be treated as a single combined exposure and the gross exposure amounts for the individual exposures shall be summed up to calculate the gross exposure amount for the single combined exposure.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), where there is insufficient information to be able to ascertain the ranking of the other liens, the institution shall treat those liens as ranking pari passu with the junior lien held by the institution. The institution shall first determine the risk weight in accordance with Article 125(2) or Article 126(2) (the “base risk weight”), as applicable. It shall then adjust this risk weight by a multiplier of 1,25, for the purposes of calculating the risk-weighted amounts of junior liens. Where the base risk weight corresponds to the lowest exposure-to-value bucket, the multiplier shall not be applied. The risk weight resulting from multiplying the base risk weight by 1,25 shall be capped at the risk weight that would be applied to the exposure if the requirements in paragraph 3 were not met.
7.   Exposures to a tenant under an immovable property leasing transaction under which the institution is the lessor and the tenant has an option to purchase shall qualify as exposures secured by immovable property and shall be treated in accordance with the treatment set out in Article 125 or 126 if the applicable conditions set out in this Article are met, provided that the exposure of the institution is secured by its ownership of the property.
8.   Member States shall designate an authority to be responsible for the application of paragraph 9. That authority shall be the competent authority or the designated authority.
Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is the competent authority, it shall ensure that the relevant national bodies and authorities which have a macroprudential mandate are duly informed of the competent authority’s intention to make use of this Article, and are appropriately involved in the assessment of financial stability concerns in its Member State in accordance with paragraph 9.
Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is different from the competent authority, the Member State shall adopt the necessary provisions to ensure proper coordination and exchange of information between the competent authority and the designated authority for the proper application of this Article. In particular, authorities shall be required to cooperate closely and to share all information that might be necessary for the adequate performance of the duties imposed upon the designated authority pursuant to this Article. That cooperation shall aim to avoid any form of duplicative or inconsistent action between the competent authority and the designated authority, as well as to ensure that the interaction with other measures, in particular measures taken under Article 458 of this Regulation and Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU, is duly taken into account.
9.   Based on the data collected under Article 430a and on any other relevant indicators, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article shall periodically, and at least annually, assess whether the risk weights laid down in Articles 125 and 126 for exposures secured by immovable property located in the territory of the Member State of that authority are appropriately based on:
(a)
the loss experience of exposures secured by immovable property;
(b)
forward-looking immovable property market developments.
Where, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article concludes that the risk weights set out in Article 125 or 126 do not adequately reflect the actual risks related to exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on residential property or on commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority, and if it considers that the inadequacy of the risk weights could adversely affect current or future financial stability in its Member State, it may increase the risk weights applicable to those exposures within the ranges determined in the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph or impose stricter criteria than those set out in paragraph 3 of this Article.
The authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article shall notify EBA and the ESRB of any adjustments to risk weights and criteria applied pursuant to this paragraph. Within one month of receipt of that notification, EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned and may indicate in that opinion, where necessary, whether they consider that the adjustments to risk weights and criteria are also recommended for other Member States. EBA and the ESRB shall publish the risk weights and criteria for exposures referred to in Articles 125 and 126 and Article 199(1), point (a), as implemented by the relevant authority.
For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article may increase the risk weights laid down in Article 125(1), first subparagraph, Article 125(2), first subparagraph, Article 126(1), first subparagraph, or Article 126(2), first subparagraph, or impose stricter criteria than those set out in paragraph 3 of this Article for exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of that authority. That authority shall not increase those risk weights to more than 150 %.
For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article may also reduce the percentages of the property value referred to in Article 125(1) or Article 126(1) or the exposure-to-value percentages that define the exposure-to-value risk weight bucket set out in in Article 125(2), Table 1, or in Article 126(2), Table 1. The relevant authority shall ensure consistency across all exposure-to-value risk weight buckets, such that the risk weight of a lower exposure-to-value risk weight bucket is always lower or equal to the risk weight of an upper exposure-to-value risk weight bucket.
10.   Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 sets higher risk weights or stricter criteria pursuant to paragraph 9, institutions shall have a six-month transitional period to apply them.
11.   EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the types of factors to be considered for the assessment of the appropriateness of the risk weights referred to in paragraph 9.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 January 2026.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
12.   The ESRB may, by means of recommendations, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, and in close cooperation with EBA, give guidance to authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Article on both of the following:
(a)
factors which could “adversely affect current or future financial stability” referred to in paragraph 9, second subparagraph;
(b)
indicative benchmarks that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 8 is to take into account when determining higher risk weights.
13.   Institutions established in a Member State shall apply the risk weights and criteria that have been determined by the authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 9 to their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that other Member State.
14.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what constitutes an “equivalent legal mechanism in place to ensure that the property under construction is completed within a reasonable timeframe”, in accordance with paragraph 3, point (a)(iii)(2).
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2025.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
