Article 126
Exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property
1.   For an exposure secured by commercial immovable property as referred to in Article 124(2), point (b)(i), the part of the exposure up to 55 % of the property value shall be assigned a risk weight of 60 %.
Where an institution holds a junior lien and there are more senior liens not held by that institution, to determine the part of the institution’s exposure that is eligible for the 60 % risk weight, the amount of 55 % of the property value shall be reduced by the amount of the more senior liens not held by the institution.
Where liens not held by the institution rank pari passu with the lien held by the institution, to determine the part of the institution’s exposure that is eligible for the 60 % risk weight, the amount of 55 % of the property value, reduced by the amount of any more senior liens not held by the institution, shall be reduced by the product of:
(a)
55 % of the property value, reduced by the amount of more senior liens, if any, both held by the institution and held by other institutions; and
(b)
the amount of liens not held by the institution that rank pari passu with the lien held by the institution divided by the sum of all pari passu liens.
Where, in accordance with Article 124(9), the competent authority or designated authority, has set a higher risk weight or a lower percentage of the property value than those referred to in this paragraph, institutions shall use the risk weight or percentage set in accordance with Article 124(9).
The remaining part of the exposure referred to in the first subparagraph, if any, shall be risk weighted as an exposure to the counterparty that is not secured by commercial immovable property.
2.   An exposure as referred to in Article 124(2), point (b)(ii), shall be assigned the risk weight set in accordance with the respective exposure-to-value risk weight bucket in Table 1.
For the purposes of this paragraph, where, in accordance with Article 124(9), the competent authority or designated authority, has set a higher risk weight or a lower exposure-to-value percentage than those referred to in this paragraph, institutions shall use the risk weight or percentage set in accordance with Article 124(9).

By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions may apply the treatment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to exposures secured by commercial immovable property which is situated within the territory of a Member State, where the competent authority of that Member State has published in accordance with Article 430a(3), loss rates for such exposures which, based on the aggregate data reported by institutions in that Member State for that national immovable property market, do not exceed any of the following limits for losses aggregated across such exposures existing in the previous year:
(a)
the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (d), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (f), does not exceed 0,3 %;
(b)
the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (e), divided by the aggregated amount reported by institutions under Article 430a(1), point (f), does not exceed 0,5 %.
3.   Institutions may apply the derogation referred to in paragraph 2, third subparagraph, of this Article also in cases where the competent authority of a third country which applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union as determined in a decision of the Commission adopted in accordance with Article 107(4), publishes corresponding loss rates for exposures secured by commercial immovable property situated within the territory of that third country.
Where a competent authority of a third country does not publish corresponding loss rates for exposures secured by commercial immovable property situated within the territory of that third country, EBA may publish such information for a third country, provided that valid statistical data, that are statistically representative of the corresponding commercial immovable property market, are available.
4.   EBA shall assess the appropriateness of adjusting the treatment of exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property, including IPRE and non-IPRE exposures, taking into account the appropriateness of risk weights and the relative differences in risk of exposures secured by residential property, the differences in risk sensitivity of IPRE exposures secured by residential property referred to in in Article 125(2), Table 1, and IPRE exposures secured by commercial immovable property referred to in Table 1 in this Article and the recommendations of the ESRB on the vulnerabilities in the commercial immovable property sector in the Union. EBA shall submit a report on its findings to the Commission by 31 December 2027.
On the basis of the report referred to in the first subparagraph and taking due account of the related internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal by 31 December 2028.’

Equity exposures

(ii)
it does not embody an obligation on the part of the issuer;
(iii)
it conveys a residual claim on the assets or income of the issuer;

instruments that embody an obligation on the part of the issuer and meet any of the following conditions:
(i)
the issuer is able to defer the settlement of the obligation indefinitely;
(ii)
the obligation requires, or permits at the issuer’s discretion, settlement by issuance of a fixed number of the issuer’s equity shares;
(iii)
the obligation requires, or permits at the issuer’s discretion, settlement by issuance of a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares and, ceteris paribus, any change in the value of the obligation is attributable to, comparable to, and in the same direction as, the change in the value of a fixed number of the issuer’s equity shares;
(iv)
the holder of the instrument has the option of requiring that the obligation be settled in equity shares, unless one of the following conditions is met:
(1)
in the case of a traded instrument, the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the instrument is traded on the market more like the debt of the issuer than like its equity;

(a)
the legislative programmes provide significant subsidies or guarantees, including by multilateral development banks, public development credit institutions as defined in Article 429a(2) or international organisations, for the investment to the institution;
(b)
the legislative programmes involve some form of government oversight;
(c)
the legislative programmes involve restrictions on the equity investment, such as limitations on the size and types of businesses in which the institution is investing, on allowable amounts of ownership interests, on the geographical location and on other relevant factors that limit the potential risk of the investment for the investing institution.

exposures where the minimum requirements for calculating IRB-CCF as specified in Section 6 are not met by the institution or where the competent authority has not permitted the use of IRB-CCF.
For the purposes of this Article, a commitment shall be deemed “revolving” where it lets an obligor obtain a loan where the obligor has the flexibility to decide how often to withdraw from the loan and at what intervals, allowing the obligor to drawdown, repay and redraw loans advanced to it. Contractual arrangements that allow prepayments and subsequent redraws of those prepayments shall be considered revolving.
8c.   Where IRB-CCF are used for the sole purpose of calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts of exposures arising from revolving commitments other than exposures assigned to the exposure class in accordance with Article 147(2), point (a), in particular pursuant to Article 153(1), Article 157 and Article 158(1), (5) and (10), the exposure value for each exposure used as an input of the risk-weighted exposure amount and expected loss formulae shall not be less than the sum of:

the drawn amount of the revolving commitment;

50 % of the off-balance exposure amount of the remaining undrawn part of the revolving commitment calculated using the applicable SA-CCF provided for in Article 111.

In that regard, the following shall not be deemed appropriate:
(a)
setting floors or caps to CCF or exposure value observations, with the exception of the realised conversion factor equal to zero, in accordance with paragraph 1, second subparagraph;
(b)
using obligor-level estimates that do not fully cover the relevant product transformation options or that inappropriately combine products with very different characteristics;
(c)
adjusting only material observations affected by product transformation;
(d)
excluding observations affected by product profile transformation.
1c.   Institutions shall ensure that their IRB-CCF are effectively quarantined from the potential effects of region of instability caused by a facility being close to being fully drawn at the reference date.

A clause in the credit protection contract providing that a flawed due diligence or fraud by the lending institution cancels or diminishes the extent of the guarantee offered by the guarantor shall not disqualify that guarantee from being considered unconditional.

‘3a.   Institutions may monitor the value of the immovable property and identify the immovable property in need of revaluation, in accordance with paragraph 3, by means of advanced statistical or other mathematical methods (“models”), provided that those methods are developed independently from the credit decision process and all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the institutions set out, in their policies and procedures, the criteria for using models to monitor the values of collateral and to identify the properties that should be revaluated; those policies and procedures shall account for such models’ proven track record, property-specific variables considered, the use of minimum available and accurate information, and the models’ uncertainty;
(b)
the institutions ensure that the models used are:
(i)
property- and location-specific at a sufficient level of granularity;
(ii)
valid and accurate, and subject to robust and regular back-testing against the actual observed transaction prices;
(iii)
based on a sufficiently large and representative sample, based on observed transaction prices;

the credit protection is direct;
(b)
the extent of the credit protection is clearly set out and incontrovertible;
(c)
the credit protection contract does not contain any clause, the fulfilment of which is outside the direct control of the lending institution, that:
(i)
would allow the protection provider to cancel or change the credit protection unilaterally;
(ii)
would increase the effective cost of the credit protection as a result of a deterioration in the credit quality of the protected exposure;
(iii)
could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original obligor fails to make any payments due, or where the leasing contract has expired for the purpose of recognising guaranteed residual value under Articles 134(7) and 166(4);
(iv)
could allow the maturity of the credit protection to be reduced by the protection provider;
(d)
the credit protection contract is legally effective and enforceable in all jurisdictions which are relevant at the time of the conclusion of the credit agreement.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), a clause in the credit protection contract providing that flawed due diligence or fraud by the lending institution cancels or diminishes the extent of the credit protection offered by the guarantor, shall not disqualify that credit protection from being eligible.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (c), the protection provider may make one lump sum payment of all monies due under the claim, or may assume the future payment obligations of the obligor covered by the credit protection contract.’

(a)
pursuant to the qualifying default of or non-payment by the original obligor, the lending institution has the right to obtain in a timely manner a provisional payment by the guarantor that meets both the following conditions:
(i)

(b)
the lending institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the effects of the guarantee, which shall also cover losses resulting from the non-payment of interest and other types of payments which the borrower is obliged to make, justify such treatment; that justification shall be properly documented and subject to dedicated internal approval and audit procedures.’

(a)
a 100 % vote is needed to amend the maturity, principal, coupon, currency or seniority status of the underlying corporate exposure;
(b)
the legal domicile in which the corporate exposure is governed has a well-established bankruptcy code that allows for a company to reorganise and restructure, and provides for an orderly settlement of creditor claims.
Where the conditions set out in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph are not met, the credit protection may nonetheless be eligible subject to a reduction in the value as specified in Article 233(2).’

(a)
the value is appraised independently from an institution’s mortgage acquisition, loan processing and loan decision process by an independent valuer who possesses the necessary qualifications, ability and experience to execute a valuation;
(b)
the value is appraised using prudently conservative valuation criteria which meet all of the following requirements:
(i)
the value excludes expectations on price increases;

where the property is revalued, the property value does not exceed the average value measured for that property, or for a comparable property over the last six years for residential property or eight years for commercial immovable property or the value at origination, whichever is higher.
For the purpose of calculating the average value, institutions shall take the average across property values observed at equal intervals and the reference period shall include at least three data points.
For the purpose of calculating the average value, institutions may use the results of the monitoring of property values in accordance with Article 208(3). The property value may exceed that average value or the value at origination, as applicable, in the case of modifications made to the property that unequivocally increase its value, such as improvements of the energy performance or improvements to the resilience, protection and adaptation to physical risks of the building or housing unit. The property value shall not be revalued upward if institutions do not have sufficient data to calculate the average value except if the value increase is based on modifications that unequivocally increase its value.
