Article 321
Inclusion of losses from merged or acquired entities or activities
1.   Losses stemming from merged or acquired entities or activities shall be included in the loss data set as soon as the business indicator items related to those entities or activities are included in the institution’s business indicator calculation in accordance with Article 315(1). To that end, institutions shall include losses observed during a 10-year period prior to the acquisition or merger.
2.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions are to determine the adjustments to their loss data set following the inclusion of losses from merged or acquired entities or activities as referred to in paragraph 1.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 January 2027.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
