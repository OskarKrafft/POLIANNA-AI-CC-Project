(*24)  Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955 (OJ L 231, 20.9.2023, p. 1).’;"
                        
(b)
in point 20, point (b) is replaced by the following:
‘(b)
in the context of Commission recommendations based on the assessment pursuant to Article 29(1), point (b), with regard to energy from renewable sources, a Member State’s early implementation of its contribution to the Union’s binding target for renewable energy for 2030 set in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 as measured against its national reference points for renewable energy;’;
(2)
in Article 4, point (a)(2) is replaced by the following:
‘(2)
with respect to renewable energy:
With a view to achieving the Union’s binding target for renewable energy for 2030 set in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, a contribution to that target in terms of the Member State’s share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards. By 2022, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 18 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State’s binding 2020 national target, and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2025, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 43 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State’s binding 2020 national target and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2027, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 65 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State’s binding 2020 national target and its contribution to the 2030 target.
By 2030, the indicative trajectory shall reach at least the Member State’s planned contribution. If a Member State expects to surpass its binding 2020 national target, its indicative trajectory may start at the level it is projected to achieve. The Member States’ indicative trajectories, taken together, shall add up to the Union reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027 and to the Union’s binding target for renewable energy for 2030 set in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Separately from its contribution to the Union target and its indicative trajectory for the purposes of this Regulation, a Member State shall be free to indicate higher ambitions for national policy purposes.’;
(3)
in Article 5, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
‘2.   Member States shall collectively ensure that the sum of their contributions amounts to at least the level of the Union’s binding target for renewable energy for 2030 set in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.’
(4)
in Article 29, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
‘2.   In the area of renewable energy, as part of its assessment referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall assess the progress made in the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consumption of energy on the basis of an indicative Union trajectory that starts from 20 % in 2020, reaches reference points of at least 18 % in 2022, 43 % in 2025 and 65 % in 2027 of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between the Union’s 2020 renewable energy target and the Union’s 2030 renewable energy target, and reaches the Union’s binding target for renewable energy for 2030 set in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.’
