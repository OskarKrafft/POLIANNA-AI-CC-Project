Article 22
Reporting of strategic stocks
1.   Member States shall, in their reports submitted pursuant to Article 45, submit to the Commission information on the state of their strategic stocks of strategic raw materials. Member States shall not be required to provide information regarding certain strategic stocks where such information could compromise their defence or national security. Where a Member State refuses to provide such information, it shall provide a justified notice.
2.   The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover strategic stocks held by all public authorities, publicly owned companies or economic operators charged by a Member State to build up strategic stocks on its behalf and shall at least include a description of:
(a)
the level of strategic stocks available for each strategic raw material, on an aggregated level, measured both in tonnes and as a percentage of annual national consumption of the relevant strategic raw materials, as well as the chemical form and purity of the raw materials stocked;
(b)
the evolution of the level of strategic stocks available for each strategic raw material, on an aggregated level, over the preceding five years;
(c)
any rules or procedures applicable to the release, allocation and distribution of strategic stocks, unless sharing such information jeopardises the protection of trade or business secrets or other sensitive, confidential or classified information.
3.   The reports referred to in paragraph 1 may include information of strategic stocks of critical and other raw materials.
