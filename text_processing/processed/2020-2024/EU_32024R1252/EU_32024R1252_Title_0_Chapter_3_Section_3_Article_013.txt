Article 13
Planning
1.   National, regional and local authorities responsible for preparing plans, including zoning, spatial plans and land use plans, shall consider including in such plans, where appropriate, provisions for the development of critical raw materials projects. Where considering to include such provisions, priority shall be given to artificial and built surfaces, industrial sites, brownfield sites, and active or abandoned mines, including, where appropriate, identified mineral occurrences.
2.   Where plans including provisions for the development of critical raw material projects are subject to an assessment pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (40) and pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC, those assessments shall be combined. Where applicable, the combined assessment shall also address the impact on potentially affected water bodies referred to in Directive 2000/60/EC. Where relevant Member States are required to assess the impacts of existing and future activities on the marine environment, including land-sea interactions, as referred to in Article 4 of Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (41), those impacts shall also be covered in the combined assessment.
