Article 21
Information obligations for monitoring
1.   Member States shall, in their reports submitted pursuant to Article 45, provide information to the Commission on new or existing critical raw material project on their territory that is relevant regarding Article 20(1), point (d), including a classification of new projects according to the United Nations Framework Classification of Resources.
2.   Member States shall identify key market operators along the critical raw materials value chain established in their territory and shall:
(a)
monitor their activities by exploring publicly available data and if necessary through regular and proportionate surveys with a view to gathering information required for the Commission’s monitoring and stress testing pursuant to Article 20;
(b)
in their reports submitted pursuant to Article 45, provide information about the results of the information gathering pursuant to point (a) of this subparagraph;
(c)
without delay notify the Commission of major events that may hinder the regular operations of the activities of key market operators.
Key market operators may refuse to submit data requested pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph if the sharing of such data would lead to the disclosure of trade or business secrets. They shall submit such data only to the extent that it is already available to them. Where a key market operator refuses to submit data requested or claims that it is not available, it shall provide the requesting Member State with reasons therefor.
3.   Member States shall transmit the data collated pursuant to paragraph 2, points (a) and (b), of this Article to national statistical authorities and to Eurostat for the purposes of compiling statistics in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (42). Member States shall designate the national authority responsible for transmitting the data to national statistical authorities and Eurostat.
