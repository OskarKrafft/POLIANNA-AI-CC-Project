Biennial report
1.   By 1 August 2021 and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a comprehensive, quantitative and qualitative report on the activities under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 in the preceding two years. The report shall focus mainly on the results achieved by the EGF and in particular shall contain information relating to applications submitted, processing time, decisions adopted, measures funded, including statistics on the indicators set out in Annex II, and the complementarity of such measures with measures funded by other Union funds, in particular ESF+, and information relating to the winding-up of financial contributions made. The report shall also document applications that have been rejected due to non-eligibility or for which the amount has been reduced due to insufficient appropriations.
2.   The report shall also be submitted for information to the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the social partners.
