Article 16
Insufficient funds
By way of derogation from the deadlines set out in Articles 8 and 15, in exceptional cases and provided that the remaining commitment appropriations available in the EGF are not sufficient to cover the amount of assistance that is necessary according to the Commission proposal, the Commission may postpone the proposal to mobilise the EGF and the subsequent budgetary transfer request until commitment appropriations are available in the following year. The annual budgetary ceiling of the EGF shall be respected in all circumstances.
