4.   When carrying out the measures contained in the coordinated package, the Member State concerned may submit a proposal to the Commission to amend the actions by adding other eligible measures as listed in points (a) and (b) of Article 7(2), provided that such amendments are duly justified and the total does not exceed the financial contribution referred to in Article 15(2). The Commission shall assess the proposed amendments and, if it agrees, shall amend the decision on the financial contribution accordingly.
5.   The Member State concerned may reallocate amounts between the budget items laid down in the decision on a financial contribution pursuant to Article 15(2). If such a reallocation exceeds a 20 % increase for one or more of the items specified, the Member State shall notify the Commission beforehand.
