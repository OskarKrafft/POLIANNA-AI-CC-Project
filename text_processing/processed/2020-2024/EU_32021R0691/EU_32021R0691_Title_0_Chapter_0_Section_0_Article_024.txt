Article 24
Recovery of the financial contribution
1.   Where the actual cost of the coordinated package is less than the amount of the financial contribution pursuant to Article 15, the Commission shall recover the corresponding amount after having given the Member State concerned the possibility to submit its observations.
2.   If, after completing the necessary verifications, the Commission concludes that a Member State either has failed to comply with the obligations stated in the decision on a financial contribution or is not complying with its obligations under Article 23(1), it shall give the Member State concerned the possibility to submit its observations.
If no agreement has been reached, the Commission shall, within 12 months of receipt of the observations from the Member State, adopt a decision to make the financial corrections required by cancelling all or part of the financial contribution of the EGF to the measure in question.
The Member State concerned shall recover any amount unduly paid as a result of an irregularity and, where the amount is not repaid by that Member State in the time allowed, default interest shall be due.
