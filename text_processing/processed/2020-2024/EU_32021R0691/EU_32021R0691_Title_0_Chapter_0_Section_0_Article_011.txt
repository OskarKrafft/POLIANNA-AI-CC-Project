Article 11
Technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission
1.   At the initiative of the Commission, a maximum of 0,5 % of the annual ceiling of the EGF may be used for technical and administrative expenditure for its implementation, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, as well as data gathering, including in relation to corporate information technology systems, communication activities and those enhancing the EGF’s visibility as a fund or with regard to specific projects and other technical assistance measures. Such measures may cover future and previous programming periods.
2.   Subject to the ceiling set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall submit a request for a transfer of appropriations for technical assistance to the relevant budgetary lines in accordance with Article 31 of the Financial Regulation.
3.   The Commission shall implement technical assistance at its own initiative under direct or indirect management in accordance with points (a) and (c) of Article 62(1) of the Financial Regulation.
Where the Commission implements technical assistance under indirect management, it shall ensure a transparent procedure for designating the third party responsible for carrying out the tasks assigned to it in accordance with the Financial Regulation. It shall inform the European Parliament and the Council as well as the public of the subcontractor selected for that purpose.
4.   The Commission’s technical assistance shall include the provision of information and guidance to the Member States on using, monitoring and evaluating the EGF. The Commission shall also provide information along with clear guidance to the social partners at Union and national level on the use of the EGF. Guidance measures may also include the creation of taskforces in cases of severe economic disruptions in a Member State.
