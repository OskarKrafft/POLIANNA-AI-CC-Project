ArticleÂ 2
The Commission shall assess whether it would be appropriate to amend Directive 2008/98/EC or Decision 2000/532/EC, or both, to recognise that waste containing any persistent organic pollutants exceeding the concentration limits specified in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 is to be classified as hazardous, and, if appropriate, based on that assessment and not later than 36 months after entry into force of this Regulation, shall put forward a legislative proposal to amend Directive 2008/98/EC or a proposal to amend Decision 2000/532/EC, or both, accordingly.
