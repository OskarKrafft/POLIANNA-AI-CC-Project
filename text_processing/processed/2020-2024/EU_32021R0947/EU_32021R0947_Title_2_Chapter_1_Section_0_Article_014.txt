Article 14
Programming documents for geographic programmes
1.   The implementation of the Instrument shall be carried out for geographic programmes through multiannual country and multi-country indicative programmes.
2.   Multiannual indicative programmes shall set out the priority areas selected for Union financing, the specific objectives, the expected results, clear and specific performance indicators, and the indicative financial allocations, both overall and per priority area and, where applicable, the methods of implementation.
3.   The multiannual indicative programmes shall be built on:
(a)
a national or regional strategy in the form of a development plan or a similar document accepted by the Commission as a basis for the corresponding multiannual indicative programme, at the time of adoption of the latter document;
(b)
a framework document laying down the Union policy towards the partner or partners concerned, including a joint document between the Union and Member States;
(c)
a joint document between the Union and the partner or partners concerned setting out common priorities and mutual commitments.
4.   To increase the impact of collective cooperation of the Union, where possible and appropriate, a joint programming document shall replace the Union’s and Member States programming documents. However, such a joint programming document shall only replace the Union’s multiannual indicative programme, provided it is approved in the implementing act adopted in accordance with Article 16, complies with Articles 12 and 13, contains the elements set out in paragraph 2 of this Article and sets out the division of labour between the Union and the Member States.
