ArticleÂ 13
Penalties
Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of rights and obligations falling within the scope of this Directive, where those rights and obligations are provided for in national law or collective agreements. In Member States without statutory minimum wages, those rules may contain or be limited to a reference to compensation and/or contractual penalties provided for, where applicable, in rules on enforcement of collective agreements. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
