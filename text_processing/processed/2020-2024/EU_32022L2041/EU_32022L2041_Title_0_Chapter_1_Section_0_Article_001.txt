Article 1
Subject matter
1.   With a view to improving living and working conditions in the Union, in particular the adequacy of minimum wages for workers in order to contribute to upward social convergence and reduce wage inequality, this Directive establishes a framework for:
(a)
adequacy of statutory minimum wages with the aim of achieving decent living and working conditions;
(b)
promoting collective bargaining on wage-setting;
(c)
enhancing effective access of workers to rights to minimum wage protection where provided for in national law and/or collective agreements.
2.   This Directive shall be without prejudice to the full respect for the autonomy of the social partners, as well as their right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements.
3.   In accordance with Article 153(5) TFEU, this Directive shall be without prejudice to the competence of Member States in setting the level of minimum wages, as well as to the choice of the Member States to set statutory minimum wages, to promote access to minimum wage protection provided for in collective agreements, or both.
4.   The application of this Directive shall be in full compliance with the right to collective bargaining. Nothing in this Directive shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any Member State:
(a)
where wage formation is ensured exclusively via collective agreements, to introduce a statutory minimum wage; or
(b)
to declare any collective agreement universally applicable.
5.   The acts by which a Member State implements the measures concerning minimum wages of seafarers periodically set by the Joint Maritime Commission or another body authorised by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall not be subject to Chapter II of this Directive. Such acts shall be without prejudice to the right to collective bargaining and to the possibility to adopt higher minimum wage levels.
