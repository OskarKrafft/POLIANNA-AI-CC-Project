Article 16
Non-regression and more favourable provisions
1.   This Directive shall not constitute valid grounds for reducing the general level of protection already provided to workers within Member States, in particular with regard to the lowering or abolition of minimum wages.
2.   This Directive shall not affect Member States’ prerogative to apply or to introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are more favourable to workers or to encourage or permit the application of collective agreements which are more favourable to workers. It shall not be construed as preventing Member States from increasing statutory minimum wages.
3.   This Directive is without prejudice to any rights conferred on workers by other legal acts of the Union.
