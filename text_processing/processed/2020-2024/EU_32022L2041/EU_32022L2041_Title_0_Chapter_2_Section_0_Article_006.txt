Article 6
Variations and deductions
1.   Where Member States allow for different rates of statutory minimum wage for specific groups of workers or for deductions that reduce the remuneration paid to a level below that of the relevant statutory minimum wage, they shall ensure that those variations and deductions respect the principles of non-discrimination and proportionality, the latter including the pursuit of a legitimate aim.
2.   Nothing in this Directive shall be construed as imposing an obligation on Member States to introduce variations of or deductions from statutory minimum wages.
