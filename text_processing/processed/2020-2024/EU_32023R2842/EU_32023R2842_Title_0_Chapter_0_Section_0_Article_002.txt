Article 7
Fishing authorisation for Union catching vessels
1.   A Union catching vessel shall be authorised to carry out specific fishing activities only insofar as they are indicated in a valid fishing authorisation, when the fisheries or fishing zones where the fishing activities are authorised, or the vessel, are subject to:
(a)
a fishing effort regime;
(b)
a multiannual plan;
(c)
a fishing restricted area;
(d)
fishing for scientific purposes;
(e)
the obligation to use a remote electronic monitoring (REM) system, including CCTV; or
(f)

‘Article 9
Vessel monitoring systems
1.   Member States shall operate vessel monitoring systems for effective monitoring of position and movement of the fishing vessels flying their flag, wherever those vessels may be, as well as of fishing vessels in their waters. Each flag Member State shall collect and analyse the vessel position data and ensure its monitoring on a continuous and systematic basis.
2.   Each Union fishing vessel shall have installed on board a fully functioning tracking device which allows that vessel to be automatically located and identified by a vessel monitoring system through transmitting automatically the vessel position data at regular intervals.
The vessel monitoring systems shall also allow the fisheries monitoring centre of the flag Member State referred to in Article 9a to poll a fishing vessel at all times. The transmission of vessel position data and the polling shall either pass through a satellite connection or, where possible, a land-based mobile network or other equivalent technology.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, Union fishing vessels of less than 12 metres in length overall may carry on board a device which does not have to be installed on board and which allows the vessel to be automatically located and identified while at sea through recording and transmitting the vessel position data at regular intervals through a satellite connection or any other network.
For the purpose of applying this paragraph, Member States shall make available such an alternative vessel monitoring system. Such system may be developed at national or Union level. If one or more Member States so request by 10 May 2024, the Commission shall develop a vessel monitoring system for fishing vessels of less than 12 metres in length overall. A requesting Member State shall implement the system as developed by the Commission. The vessel monitoring system shall allow the fisheries monitoring centre of the flag Member State referred to in Article 9a to poll the position of the fishing vessel through a satellite connection or, where possible, any other network. In the event that the device referred to in this paragraph is not within reach of a network, the vessel position data shall be recorded during that period of time and shall be transmitted automatically as soon as the vessel is in reach of such network. Connection with the network shall be re-established at the latest before entering a port or landing site.
4.   Without prejudice to obligations under other Union legal acts, a Member State may exempt, until 31 December 2029, fishing vessels of less than 9 metres in length overall flying its flag from the requirement to be fitted with a vessel monitoring system if such vessels:
(a)
operate exclusively:
(i)
in the waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of that Member State up to six nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured and use only passive gear; or
(ii)
in the waters on the landward side of the baselines of that Member State;
(b)
never spend more than 24 hours at sea from the time of departure from port to the return to port; and
(c)
are not subject to restrictions applicable in any fishing restricted area in which they operate.
5.   When a Union fishing vessel is in the waters of another Member State, the flag Member State shall make available the vessel position data of that vessel by automatic transmission of the data received to the fisheries monitoring centre of the coastal Member State.
6.   If a Union fishing vessel engages in fishing activities in the waters of a third country or in waters where the fishing resources are managed by a regional fisheries management organisation as referred to in Article 3(1), and if the agreement with that third country or the applicable rules of that organisation so provide, vessel position data shall also be made available to that country or organisation.
7.   Without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*6), all third-country fishing vessels authorised to conduct fishing activities in Union waters shall have installed on board a fully functioning device which allows such a vessel to be automatically located and identified by a vessel monitoring system through transmitting the vessel position data at regular intervals in the same way as Union fishing vessels under this Article.
8.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, lay down detailed rules on:
(a)
the format and content of vessel position data;
(b)
the minimum requirements and minimum technical specifications of vessel monitoring devices;
(c)
the frequency of transmission of the data concerning the position and movement of fishing vessels, including in fishing restricted areas;
(d)
the transmission of data to coastal Member States;
(e)
the responsibilities of the masters of fishing vessels concerning the operation of vessel monitoring devices.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 119(2).
