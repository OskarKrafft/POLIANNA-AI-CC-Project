Article 7
Conditional access to resources
1.   Where a Member State has not made a commitment to implement the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, only 50 % of the annual allocations for that Member State set out in accordance with Articles 3(4) and 4(3) shall be made available for programming and included in the priorities.
By way of derogation from Article 10(1) of this Regulation, the remaining 50 % of the annual allocations shall not be included in the priorities. In such cases, the programmes supported from the JTF and submitted in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 shall include only 50 % of the annual JTF allocations in the table referred to in point (g)(ii) of Article 22(3) of that Regulation. The table referred to in point (g)(i) of Article 22(3) of that Regulation shall identify separately the allocations available for programming and those allocations that shall not be programmed.
2.   The Commission shall only approve programmes containing a JTF priority, or any amendment thereto, where the requirements set out in the programmed allocation part in accordance with paragraph 1 are respected.
3.   As soon as a Member State has committed to implement the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, it may submit a request for the amendment of each programme supported from the JTF in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and include the non-programmed allocations that have not been decommitted.
4.   Budgetary commitments shall be made on the basis of the table referred to in point (g)(i) of Article 22(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. The commitments related to the non-programmed allocations shall not be used for payments and shall not be included in the basis for the calculation of the pre-financing in accordance with Article 90 of that Regulation until they are made available for programming in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.
By way of derogation from Article 105 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, in the absence of the Member State’s commitment to implement the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050 by 31 December of any given year starting from 2022, budgetary commitments for the preceding year which relate to non-programmed allocations shall be decommitted in their entirety in the following year.
