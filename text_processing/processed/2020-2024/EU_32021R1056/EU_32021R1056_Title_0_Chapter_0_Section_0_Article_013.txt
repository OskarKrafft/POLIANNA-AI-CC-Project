Article 13
Financial corrections
Based on the examination of the final performance report of the programme, the Commission may make financial corrections in accordance with Article 104 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 where less than 65 % of the target set out for one or more output indicators is achieved.
Financial corrections shall be in proportion to the achievements and shall not be applied where the failure to achieve targets is due to the impact of socio-economic or environmental factors, significant changes in the economic or environmental conditions in the Member State concerned or because of reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of the priorities concerned.
