Article 6
Specific allocations for outermost regions and islands
When preparing their territorial just transition plans in accordance with Article 11(1), Member States shall take particular account of the situation of islands and outermost regions facing serious socio-economic challenges deriving from the transition process towards the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate and a climate-neutral economy of the Union by 2050, having regard to their specific needs as recognised in Articles 174 and 349 TFEU.
When including such territories in their territorial just transition plans, Member States shall set out the specific amount allocated for those territories with the corresponding justification, taking into account the specific challenges of those territories.
