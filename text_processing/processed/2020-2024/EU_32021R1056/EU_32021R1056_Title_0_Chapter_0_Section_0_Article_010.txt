Article 10
Programming of the JTF resources
1.   The JTF resources shall be programmed for the categories of regions where the territories concerned are located, on the basis of territorial just transition plans established in accordance with Article 11 and approved by the Commission as part of a programme or a programme amendment. The resources programmed shall take the form of one or more specific programmes or of one or more priorities within programmes.
The Commission shall only approve a programme, or any amendment thereto, where the identification of the territories most negatively affected by the transition process, contained within the relevant territorial just transition plan, is duly justified and the relevant territorial just transition plan is consistent with the integrated national energy and climate plan of the Member State concerned.
2.   A JTF priority or priorities shall comprise the JTF resources consisting of all or part of the JTF allocation for the Member States and the resources transferred in accordance with Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. The total of the ERDF and ESF+ resources transferred to the JTF shall not exceed three times the amount of support from the JTF to that priority excluding the resources referred to in Article 4(1) of this Regulation.
3.   In accordance with Article 112 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the co-financing rate, applicable to the region where the territory or territories identified in the territorial just transition plans in accordance with Article 11 of this Regulation are located, for the JTF priority or priorities shall not be higher than:
(a)
85 % for less developed regions;
(b)
70 % for transition regions;
(c)
50 % for more developed regions.
