Commodity derivatives shall be considered to be critical or significant where the sum of all net positions of end position holders constitutes the size of their open interest and is at a minimum of 300 000 lots on average over a one-year period. The limits shall be set based on all positions held by a person and those held on his or her behalf at an aggregate group level in order to:

support orderly pricing and settlement conditions, including preventing market distorting positions, and ensuring, in particular, convergence between prices of derivatives in the delivery month and spot prices for the underlying commodity, without prejudice to price discovery on the market for the underlying commodity.
The position limits referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to:
(a)
positions held by, or on behalf of, a non-financial entity, and which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity of that non-financial entity;

any other securities as referred to in point (c) of point (44) of Article 4(1) which relate to a commodity or an underlying as referred to in Section C.10 of Annex I.

ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine a procedure setting out how persons may apply for an exemption for positions resulting from transactions entered into to fulfil obligations to provide liquidity on a trading venue.
ESMA shall submit the draft regulatory technical standards referred to in the third and fourth subparagraphs to the Commission by 28 November 2021.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the third and fourth subparagraphs of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.’;

When drawing up the list of critical or significant commodity derivatives referred to in paragraph 1, ESMA shall take into account the following factors:

(e)
the development of new commodity derivatives;
(f)
the experience of investment firms or market operators operating a trading venue and of other jurisdictions regarding the position limits.
ESMA shall submit the draft regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph to the Commission by 28 November 2021.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
4.   A competent authority shall set position limits for critical or significant commodity derivatives and agricultural commodity derivatives that are traded on trading venues, based on the calculation methodology laid down in the regulatory technical standards adopted by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 3. Such position limits shall include economically equivalent OTC contracts.
A competent authority shall review the position limits referred to in the first subparagraph where there is a significant change on the market, including a significant change in deliverable supply or open interest, based on its determination of deliverable supply and open interest, and reset those position limits in accordance with the calculation methodology laid down in the regulatory technical standards adopted by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 3.’;
(c)

‘6.   Where agricultural commodity derivatives based on the same underlying and sharing the same characteristics are traded in significant volumes on trading venues in more than one jurisdiction, or where critical or significant commodity derivatives based on the same underlying and sharing the same characteristics are traded on trading venues in more than one jurisdiction, the competent authority of the trading venue where the largest volume of trading takes place (“central competent authority”) shall set the single position limit to be applied on all trading in those derivatives. The central competent authority shall consult the competent authorities of other trading venues on which those agricultural commodity derivatives are traded in significant volumes or on which those critical or significant commodity derivatives are traded, on the single position limit to be applied and any revisions to that single position limit.
Competent authorities that do not agree with the setting of the single position limit by the central competent authority shall state in writing the full and detailed reasons why they consider that the requirements laid down in paragraph 1 have not been met. ESMA shall settle any dispute arising from a disagreement between competent authorities in accordance with its powers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
The competent authorities of the trading venues where agricultural commodity derivatives that are based on the same underlying and that share the same characteristics are traded in significant volumes or critical or significant commodity derivatives that are based on the same underlying and that share the same characteristics are traded, and the competent authorities of position holders in those derivatives, shall put in place cooperation arrangements, which shall include the exchange of relevant data, in order to enable the monitoring and enforcement of the single position limit.
7.   ESMA shall monitor at least once a year the way competent authorities have implemented the position limits set in accordance with the calculation methodology established by ESMA under paragraph 3. In doing so, ESMA shall ensure that a single position limit effectively applies to the agricultural commodity derivatives and critical or significant contracts based on the same underlying and sharing the same characteristics irrespective of where they are traded in line with paragraph 6.
8.   Member States shall ensure that an investment firm or a market operator operating a trading venue which trades commodity derivatives applies position management controls, including powers for the trading venue to:
(a)
monitor the open interest positions of persons;
(b)
obtain information, including all relevant documentation, from persons about the size and purpose of a position or exposure entered into, information about beneficial or underlying owners, any concert arrangements, and any related assets or liabilities in the underlying market, including, where appropriate, positions held in commodity derivatives that are based on the same underlying and that share the same characteristics on other trading venues and in economically equivalent OTC contracts through members and participants;
(c)
request a person to terminate or reduce a position, on a temporary or permanent basis, and to unilaterally take action to ensure the termination or reduction of the position where the person does not comply with such request; and
(d)
require a person to provide, on a temporary basis, liquidity back into the market at an agreed price and volume with the express intent of mitigating the effects of a large or dominant position.
ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the content of position management controls, thereby taking into account the characteristics of the trading venues concerned.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 November 2021.
