Article 24
Information, communication and publicity
1.   The recipients of Union funding shall acknowledge the origin of those funds and ensure the visibility of the Union funding, in particular when promoting actions and their results, by providing coherent, effective, meaningful and proportionate targeted information to multiple audiences, including the media and the public. The visibility of Union funding shall be ensured and such information shall be provided, except in duly justified cases where it is not possible or appropriate to display such information publicly or where the release of such information is restricted by law, in particular for reasons of security, public order, criminal investigations or the protection of personal data. To ensure the visibility of Union funding, recipients of Union funding shall refer to the origin of that funding when publicly communicating on the action concerned, and shall display the Union emblem.
2.   To reach the widest possible audience, the Commission shall implement information and communication actions relating to the Fund, to actions taken pursuant to the Fund and to the results obtained.
Financial resources allocated to the Fund shall also contribute to the corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union, insofar as those priorities are related to the objectives of the Fund.
3.   The Commission shall publish the work programmes of the thematic facility referred to in Article 8. For support provided under direct or indirect management, the Commission shall publish the information referred to in Article 38(2) of the Financial Regulation on a publicly available website and shall update that information regularly. That information shall be published in an open, machine-readable format which allows data to be sorted, searched, extracted and compared.
