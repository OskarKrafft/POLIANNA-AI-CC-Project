Article 231
Guarantees
The authorising officer responsible may, if he or she deems it appropriate and proportionate, on a case-by-case basis and subject to a risk analysis, require a European political party to lodge a guarantee in advance in order to limit the financial risks connected with the pre-financing payment only when, in the light of the risk analysis, the European political party is at imminent risk of being in one of the exclusion situations referred to in Article 138(1), points (a) and (d), of this Regulation or when a decision of the Authority for European political parties and European political foundations established under Article 6 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 (the ‘Authority’) has been communicated to the European Parliament and to the Council in accordance with Article 10(4) of that Regulation.
Article 156 shall apply mutatis mutandis to guarantees which may be required in the cases foreseen in the first paragraph of this Article to pre-financing payments made to European political parties.
