Article 194
Principle of non-cumulative award and prohibition of double funding
1.   Each action may give rise to the award of only one grant from the budget to any one beneficiary, except where otherwise authorised in the relevant basic acts.
A beneficiary may be awarded only one operating grant from the budget per financial year.
An action may be financed jointly from separate budget lines by different authorising officers responsible.
2.   The applicant shall immediately inform the authorising officers of any multiple applications and multiple grants relating to the same action or to the same work programme.
3.   In no circumstances shall the same costs be financed twice by the budget.
4.   In relation to the following types of support, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply and, where appropriate, the Commission may decide not to verify whether the same cost was financed twice:
(a)
study, research, training or education support paid to natural persons;
(b)
direct support paid to natural persons most in need, such as unemployed persons and refugees.
