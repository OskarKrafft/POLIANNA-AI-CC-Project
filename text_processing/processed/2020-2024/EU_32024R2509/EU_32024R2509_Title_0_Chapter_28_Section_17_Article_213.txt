Article 213
Financial liability of the Union
1.   The financial liability and aggregate net payments from the budget shall not exceed at any time:
(a)
for financial instruments: the amount of the relevant budgetary commitment made for it;
(b)
for budgetary guarantees: the amount of the budgetary guarantee authorised by the basic act;
(c)
for financial assistance: the maximum amount of funds that the Commission is empowered to borrow for funding the financial assistance as authorised by the basic act, and the relevant interest.
2.   Budgetary guarantees and financial assistance may generate a contingent liability for the Union which shall only exceed the financial assets provided to cover the financial liability of the Union if provided for in a basic act establishing a budgetary guarantee or financial assistance and under the conditions set out therein.
3.   For the purposes of the annual assessment provided for in Article 256, the contingent liabilities arising from budgetary guarantees or financial assistance borne by the budget shall be deemed sustainable, if their forecast multiannual evolution is compatible with the limits set by the regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework provided for in Article 312(2) TFEU and the ceiling on annual payment appropriations set out in Article 3(1) of Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053.
