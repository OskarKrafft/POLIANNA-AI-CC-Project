Article 172
Contacts during the procurement procedure
1.   Before the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, the contracting authority may communicate additional information about the procurement documents if it discovers an error or omission in the text or upon request from candidates or tenderers. Information provided shall be disclosed to all candidates or tenderers.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, in a situation of extreme urgency resulting from a crisis, the contracting authority may contact in writing all invited candidates before the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, with the sole purpose of clarifying their intention to submit a request to participate or a tender, subject to the conditions set out in Article 163(6).
2.   After the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, in every case where contact has been made, and in the duly justified cases where contact has not been made as provided for in Article 154, a record shall be kept in the procurement file.
