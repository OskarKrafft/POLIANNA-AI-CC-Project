Article 175
Performance and modifications of the contract
1.   Performance of the contract shall not start before it is signed.
2.   The contracting authority may modify a contract or framework contract without a procurement procedure only in the cases provided for in paragraph 3 and provided the modification does not alter the subject matter of the contract or framework contract, within the meaning of paragraph 4.
3.   A contract, a framework contract or a specific contract under a framework contract may be modified without a new procurement procedure in any of the following cases:
(a)
for additional works, supplies or services by the original contractor that have become necessary and that were not included in the initial procurement, where the following conditions are fulfilled:
(i)
a change of contractor cannot be made for technical reasons linked to interchangeability or interoperability requirements with existing equipment, services or installations;
(ii)
a change of contractor would cause substantial duplication of costs for the contracting authority;
(iii)
any increase in price, including the net cumulative value of successive modifications, does not exceed 50 % of the initial contract value;
(b)
where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(i)
the need for modification has been brought about by circumstances which a diligent contracting authority could not foresee;
(ii)
any increase in price does not exceed 50 % of the initial contract value;
(c)
where the value of the modification is below the following thresholds:
(i)
the thresholds referred to in Article 178(1), and in point 39 of Annex I in the field of external actions, applicable at the time of the modification; and
(ii)
10 % of the initial contract value for public service and supply contracts and works or services concession contracts and 15 % of the initial contract value for public works contracts;
(d)
where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(i)
the minimum requirements of the initial procurement procedure are not altered;
(ii)
any ensuing modification of value complies with the conditions set out in this subparagraph, point (c), unless such modification of value results from the strict application of the procurement documents or contractual provisions.
The initial contract value shall not take into account price revisions.
The net cumulative value of several successive modifications under the first subparagraph, point (c), shall not exceed any threshold referred to therein.
The contracting authority shall apply the ex post publicity measures set out in Article 166.
4.   A modification shall be considered to be altering the subject matter of the contract or framework contract, where it renders the contract or framework contract materially different in substance from the one initially concluded. In any event, a modification shall be considered to be altering the subject matter of the contract or framework contract where one or more of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the modification introduces or supresses significant conditions which, had they been part of the initial procurement procedure, would have allowed for the admission of other tenderers than those initially selected or for the acceptance of a tender other than that originally accepted, or would have attracted additional participants in the procurement procedure, or would not have led to the selection of the successful tenderer;
(b)
the modification significantly changes the economic balance of the contract or the framework contract in favour of the contractor in a manner which was not provided for in the initial contract or framework contract;
(c)
the modification significantly extends the scope of the contract or framework contract.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, point (b)(ii), in a situation of extreme urgency resulting from a crisis, the contracting authority may, in agreement with the contractor, modify a contract or a framework contract beyond the threshold of 50 % and up to 100 % of the initial contract value, provided that this is justified as strictly necessary to respond to the evolution of the crisis, subject to the conditions set out in Article 163(6).
By way of derogation from paragraph 3, in a situation of extreme urgency resulting from a crisis, the terms of a framework contract may be modified by common agreement to apply to those new contracting authorities added following a modification of the framework contract, including in the case of inter-institutional or joint procurements, subject to the conditions set out in Article 163(6).
