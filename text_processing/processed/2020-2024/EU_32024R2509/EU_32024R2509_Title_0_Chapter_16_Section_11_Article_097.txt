Article 97
Estimate of amounts receivable
1.   When the authorising officer responsible has sufficient and reliable information in respect of any measure or situation which may give rise to an amount being owed to the Union, the authorising officer responsible shall make an estimate of the amount receivable.
2.   The estimate of the amount receivable shall be adjusted by the authorising officer responsible as soon as he or she is aware of an event modifying the measure or the situation which gave rise to the estimate being made.
When establishing the recovery order on a measure or situation that had previously given rise to an estimate of amounts receivable, that estimate shall be adjusted accordingly by the authorising officer responsible.
If the recovery order is drawn up for the same amount as the original estimate of amounts receivable, that estimate shall be reduced to zero.
3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, no estimate of the amount receivable shall be made before Member States make available to the Commission the amounts of own resources defined in Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053, which are paid at fixed intervals by Member States. The authorising officer responsible shall issue a recovery order in respect of those amounts.
