Article 53
Rules on the establishment plans for staff
1.   The establishment plans referred to in Article 52(1), point (c), shall constitute an absolute limit for each Union institution or body. No appointment shall be made in excess of the limit set.
However, save in the case of grades AD 14, AD 15 and AD 16, each Union institution or body may modify its establishment plans by up to 10 % of posts authorised, subject to the following conditions:
(a)
the volume of staff appropriations corresponding to a full financial year is not affected;
(b)
the limit of the total number of posts authorised by each establishment plan is not exceeded;
(c)
the Union institution or body has taken part in a benchmarking exercise with other Union institutions and bodies as initiated by the Commission’s staff screening exercise.
At least three weeks before making a modification as referred to in the second subparagraph, the Union institution concerned shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of its intention to do so. In the event that duly justified objections are raised within this period by the European Parliament or the Council, the Union institution shall refrain from making the modifications and the procedure laid down in Article 44 shall apply.
2.   By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, the effects of part-time work authorised by the appointing authority in accordance with the Staff Regulations may be offset by other appointments.
