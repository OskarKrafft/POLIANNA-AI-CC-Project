Article 15
Making appropriations corresponding to decommitments available again
1.   The appropriations corresponding to decommitments referred to in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 514/2014, (EU) 2021/1060 and (EU) 2021/2116 may be made available again in the event of a manifest error attributable solely to the Commission.
To that end, the Commission shall examine decommitments made during the preceding financial year and shall decide, by 15 February of the current financial year, on the basis of requirements, whether it is necessary to make the corresponding appropriations available again.
2.   In addition to the case referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the appropriations corresponding to decommitments shall be made available again in the event of a decommitment of resources transferred back to the fund from which they have been initially transferred in line with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.
3.   Commitment appropriations corresponding to the amount of decommitments made as a result of total or partial non-implementation of corresponding research projects may also be made available again to the benefit of the research programme the projects belong to or its successor in the context of the budgetary procedure.
