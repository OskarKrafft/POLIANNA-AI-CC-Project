Article 71
Public-private partnership bodies
Bodies having legal personality that are set up by a basic act and entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership shall adopt their own financial rules.
Those rules shall include a set of principles necessary to ensure sound financial management of Union funds.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 275 to supplement this Regulation with a model financial regulation for public-private partnership bodies laying down the principles necessary to ensure sound financial management of Union funds and which shall be based on Article 157.
The financial rules of the public-private partnership bodies shall not depart from the model financial regulation except where their specific needs so require and subject to the Commission’s prior consent.
Article 70(4) to (7) shall apply to public-private partnership bodies.
