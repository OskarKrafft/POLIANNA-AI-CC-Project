Article 146
Communication in the context of early detection and exclusion procedures
1.   All communication, in particular notification of decisions, letters, documents or information related to early detection and exclusion procedures shall be made in writing on paper or in electronic format.
2.   Notifications for communications which create legal effects or trigger time limits shall be made on paper by registered post with acknowledgement of receipt or by courier service with proof of delivery, through a secure electronic exchange system pursuant to Article 151, or by e-mail or other electronic means.
3.   Communications shall:
(a)
when made on paper, be considered to have been notified when they have been delivered to the most recent postal address provided by the recipient party. Notifications by registered post with acknowledgement of receipt or by courier service with proof of delivery shall be considered to have been received either on the delivery date registered by the postal service or by courier service or after the time limit for collection at the post office, or, in the absence of such time limit, three weeks after the attempted delivery, provided that the notification has been sent a second time and announced electronically to the most recent e-mail address provided by the recipient party;
(b)
when made through a secure electronic exchange system referred to in Article 151, be considered to have been notified on the date and time they are accessed, as indicated by the time logs in the system or, in the case of communications that have not been accessed, 10 days after sending;
(c)
when made by e-mail or other electronic means, be deemed to be notified on the day of dispatch of the e-mail, provided that it is sent to the most recent e-mail address provided by the recipient party and the sending party has not received a non-delivery report.
Where the addressee can demonstrate that he or she has been prevented by circumstances outside his or her control from accessing a communication, the legal effects of the communication shall start running from the moment on which the addressee can demonstrate that he or she has gained access to its content.
