Article 98
Establishment of amounts receivable
1.   In order to establish an amount receivable, the authorising officer responsible shall:
(a)
verify that the debt exists;
(b)
determine or verify the reality and the amount of the debt; and
(c)
verify the conditions according to which the debt is due.
The establishment of an amount receivable shall constitute recognition of the right of the Union in respect of a debtor and establishment of entitlement to demand that the debtor pay the debt.
2.   Any amount receivable that is identified as being certain, of a fixed amount and due shall be established by a recovery order by which the authorising officer responsible instructs the accounting officer to recover the amount. It shall be followed by a debit note sent to the debtor, except for the cases where a waiver procedure is carried out immediately in accordance with paragraph 4, second subparagraph. Both the recovery order and the debit note shall be drawn up by the authorising officer responsible.
The authorising officer shall send the debit note immediately after establishing the amount receivable and at the latest within a period of five years from the time when the Union institution was, in normal circumstances, in a position to claim its debt. Such period shall not apply where the authorising officer responsible establishes that, despite the efforts which the Union institution has made, the delay in acting was caused by the debtor’s conduct.
3.   To establish an amount receivable the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that:
(a)
the amount receivable is certain, meaning that it is not subject to any condition;
(b)
the amount receivable is fixed, expressed precisely in cash terms;
(c)
the amount receivable is due and is not subject to any payment time;
(d)
the particulars of the debtor are correct;
(e)
the amount is booked to the correct budgetary item;
(f)
the supporting documents are in order; and
(g)
the principle of sound financial management is complied with, in particular with regard to the criteria referred to in Article 101(2), first subparagraph, point (a) or (b).
4.   The debit note shall be to inform the debtor that:
(a)
the Union has established the amount receivable;
(b)
if payment of the debt is made within the deadline, as specified in the debit note, no default interest will be due;
(c)
failing payment of the debt within the deadline referred to in point (b) of this subparagraph the debt shall bear interest at the rate referred to in Article 99, without any prejudice to any specific regulations applicable;
(d)
failing payment of the debt by the deadline referred to in point (b) the Union institution will effect recovery either by offsetting or by enforcement of any guarantee lodged in advance;
(e)
the accounting officer may in exceptional circumstances effect recovery by offsetting before the deadline referred to in point (b), where it is necessary to protect the financial interests of the Union when he or she has justified grounds to believe that the amount due to the Union would be lost, after the debtor has been informed of the reasons and date of the recovery by offsetting;
(f)
if, after taking all the steps set out in points (a) to (e) of this subparagraph, the amount has not been recovered in full, the Union institution will effect recovery by enforcement of a decision secured either in accordance with Article 100(2) or by legal action.
Where following the verification of the particulars of the debtor or on the basis of other relevant information available at the time, it is clear that the debt falls under the cases referred to in Article 101(2), first subparagraph, point (a) or (b), or that the debit note has not been sent in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, the authorising officer shall, after having established the amount receivable, decide to directly waive recovery in accordance with Article 101 without sending a debit note, in agreement with the accounting officer.
In all other cases, the authorising officer shall print out the debit note and send it to the debtor. The accounting officer shall be informed of the dispatch of the debit note through the financial information system.
5.   Amounts wrongly paid shall be recovered.
