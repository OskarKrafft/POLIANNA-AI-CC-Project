Article 173
Award decision and information to candidates or tenderers
1.   The authorising officer responsible shall decide to whom the contract is to be awarded, in compliance with the selection and award criteria specified in the procurement documents.
2.   The contracting authority shall notify all candidates or tenderers, whose request to participate or tender is rejected, of the grounds on which the decision was taken. In addition, successful and unsuccessful tenderers shall be notified of the duration of the standstill period referred to in Articles 178(2) and 181(1), when such standstill period is applicable.
For the award of specific contracts under a framework contract with reopening of competition, the contracting authority shall inform the tenderers of the result of the evaluation.
3.   The contracting authority shall inform each tenderer who is not rejected and who makes a request in writing, of any of the following:
(a)
the name of the tenderer, or tenderers in the case of a framework contract, to whom the contract is awarded and, except in the case of a specific contract under a framework contract with reopening of competition, the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender and its total financial offer amount;
(b)
the progress of negotiation and dialogue with tenderers.
However, the contracting authority may decide to withhold certain information where its release would impede law enforcement, would be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of economic operators or might distort fair competition between them.
