Article 140
Financial penalties
1.   In order to ensure a deterrent effect, the authorising officer responsible may, having regard, where applicable, to the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 145, impose a financial penalty on a recipient with whom a legal commitment has been entered into and who is in an exclusion situation as referred to in Article 138(1), point (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i).
Regarding the exclusion situations referred to in Article 138(1), points (c) to (i), the financial penalty may be imposed as an alternative to a decision to exclude a recipient, where such an exclusion would be disproportionate on the basis of the criteria referred to in Article 138(4).
Regarding the exclusion situations referred to in Article 138(1), points (c), (d) and (e), the financial penalty may be imposed in addition to an exclusion where this is necessary to protect the financial interests of the Union, due to the systemic and recurrent conduct engaged in by the recipient with the intention to unduly obtain Union funds.
Notwithstanding the first, second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph, a financial penalty shall not be imposed on a recipient who in accordance with Article 139 has disclosed that it is in an exclusion situation.
2.   The amount of the financial penalty shall not exceed 10 % of the total value of the legal commitment. In the event of a grant agreement signed with a number of beneficiaries the financial penalty shall not exceed 10 % of the grant amount the beneficiary concerned is entitled to in accordance with the grant agreement.
