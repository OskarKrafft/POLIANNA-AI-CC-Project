Article 33
Performance and principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
1.   Appropriations shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, and thus be implemented respecting the following principles:
(a)
the principle of economy which requires that the resources used by the Union institution concerned in the pursuit of its activities shall be made available in due time, in appropriate quantity and quality, and at the best price;
(b)
the principle of efficiency which concerns the best relationship between the resources employed, the activities undertaken and the achievement of objectives;
(c)
the principle of effectiveness which concerns the extent to which the objectives pursued are achieved through the activities undertaken.
2.   In line with the principle of sound financial management, the use of appropriations shall focus on performance and for that purpose:
(a)
objectives for programmes and activities shall be established ex ante;
(b)
progress in the achievement of objectives, including mainstreamed ones, where relevant, shall be monitored with performance indicators;
(c)
progress in, and problems with, the achievement of objectives shall be reported to the European Parliament and to the Council in accordance with Article 41(3), first subparagraph, point (h), and with Article 253(1), point (e);
(d)
programmes and activities shall, where feasible and appropriate in accordance with the relevant sector-specific rules, be implemented to achieve their set objectives without doing significant harm to the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, as set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (44);
(e)
programmes and activities shall, where feasible and appropriate in accordance with the relevant sector-specific rules, be implemented to achieve their set objectives respecting working and employment conditions under applicable national law, Union law, ILO conventions and collective agreements;
(f)
programmes and activities shall, where feasible and appropriate in accordance with the relevant sector-specific rules, be implemented taking into account the principle of gender equality and in accordance with an appropriate gender mainstreaming methodology.
3.   Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound objectives as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and indicators that are relevant, accepted, credible, easy, robust and based on widely recognised scientific evidence and an effective, transparent and comprehensive methodology shall be defined where relevant. Where appropriate, the data collected in relation to such indicators shall be broken down by gender and shall be collected in a way allowing for aggregation of such data across all relevant programmes.
