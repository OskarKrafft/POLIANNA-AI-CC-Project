In the field of external actions, they may also be established pursuant to the laws of a country other than a Member State. The managers of such vehicles shall be obliged by law or contractually to act with the diligence of a professional manager and in good faith.

The selection shall be transparent, justified on objective grounds and shall not give rise to a conflict of interests.
