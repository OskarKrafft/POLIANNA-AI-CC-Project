Article 154
Clarification and correction of application documents
The authorising officer responsible may correct obvious clerical errors in application documents after confirmation of the intended correction by the participant.
Where a participant fails to submit evidence or to make statements, the evaluation committee or, where appropriate, the authorising officer responsible shall, except in duly justified cases, ask the participant to provide the missing information or to clarify supporting documents.
Such information, clarification or confirmation shall not substantially change application documents.
