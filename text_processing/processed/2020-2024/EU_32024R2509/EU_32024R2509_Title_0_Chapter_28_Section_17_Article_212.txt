Article 212
Principles and conditions applicable to financial instruments and budgetary guarantees
1.   Financial instruments and budgetary guarantees shall be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, transparency, proportionality, non-discrimination, equal treatment and subsidiarity, and in accordance with their objectives.
2.   Financial instruments and budgetary guarantees shall:
(a)
address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations and provide support, in a proportionate manner, only to final recipients that are deemed economically viable according to internationally accepted standards at the time of the Union financial support;
(b)
achieve additionality by preventing the replacement of potential support and investment from other public or private sources;
(c)
not distort competition in the internal market and be consistent with State aid rules;
(d)
achieve a leverage and a multiplier effect, with a target range of values based on an ex ante evaluation for the corresponding financial instrument or budgetary guarantee, by mobilising a global investment exceeding the size of the Union contribution or guarantee, including, where appropriate, the maximisation of private investment;
(e)
be implemented in a way to ensure that there is a common interest of the implementing entities or counterparts involved in the implementation in achieving the policy objectives defined in the relevant basic act, with provisions on for example co-investment, risk sharing requirements or financial incentives, while preventing a conflict of interests with other activities of the entities or counterparts;
(f)
provide for remuneration of the Union that is consistent with the sharing of risk among financial participants and the policy objectives of the financial instrument or budgetary guarantee;
(g)
where remuneration of the implementing entities or the counterparts involved in the implementation is due, provide that such remuneration is performance-based and comprises:
(i)
administrative fees to remunerate the entity or counterpart for the work carried out in the implementation of a financial instrument or budgetary guarantee, which shall, to the extent possible, be based on the operations carried out or the amounts disbursed; and
(ii)
where appropriate, policy related incentives to promote the achievement of the policy objectives or incentivise the financial performance of the financial instrument or budgetary guarantee.
Exceptional expenses may be reimbursed in duly justified cases;
(h)
be based on ex ante evaluations, individually or as part of a programme, in line with Article 34, containing explanations concerning the choice of the type of financial operation taking into account the policy objectives pursued and the associated financial risks and savings for the budget.
The evaluations referred to in the first subparagraph, point (h), shall be reviewed and updated to take into account the effect of major socioeconomic changes on the rationale of the financial instrument or budgetary guarantee.
3.   Without prejudice to sector-specific rules for shared management, revenue, including dividends, capital gains, guarantee fees and interest on loans and on amounts on fiduciary accounts paid back to the Commission or on fiduciary accounts opened for financial instruments or budgetary guarantees and attributable to the support from the budget under a financial instrument or a budgetary guarantee, shall be entered in the budget after deduction of management costs and fees.
Annual repayments, including capital repayments, guarantees released, and repayments of the principal of loans, paid back to the Commission or to fiduciary accounts opened for financial instruments or budgetary guarantees and attributable to the support from the budget under a financial instrument or a budgetary guarantee, shall constitute internal assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(3), point (f), and shall be used for the same financial instrument or budgetary guarantee, without prejudice to Article 218(4), for a period not exceeding the period for the budgetary commitment plus two years, unless otherwise specified in a basic act.
The Commission shall take into account such internal assigned revenue when proposing the amount for future allocations for financial instruments or budgetary guarantees.
Notwithstanding the second subparagraph, the outstanding amount of assigned revenue authorised under a basic act that is to be repealed or terminates may also be assigned to another financial instrument pursuing similar objectives, where this is provided in the basic act establishing that financial instrument.
4.   The authorising officer responsible for a financial instrument, a budgetary guarantee or a financial assistance shall produce a financial statement covering the period 1 January to 31 December, in accordance with Article 249 and in compliance with the accounting rules referred to in Article 80 and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).
For financial instruments and budgetary guarantees implemented under indirect management, the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that unaudited financial statements covering the period 1 January to 31 December prepared in compliance with the accounting rules referred to in Article 80 and with IPSAS, as well as any information necessary to produce financial statements in accordance with Article 82(2), be provided by the entities pursuant to Article 62(1), first subparagraph, points (c)(ii), (iii), (v) and (vi), by 15 February of the following financial year and that audited financial statements be provided by those entities by 15 April of the following financial year.
5.   Where financial instruments or budgetary guarantees are combined within a single agreement with ancillary support from the budget, including grants, this Title shall apply to the whole measure. The reporting shall be carried out in accordance with Article 41(4) and (5) and shall clearly identify which parts of the measure are financial instruments or budgetary guarantees.
