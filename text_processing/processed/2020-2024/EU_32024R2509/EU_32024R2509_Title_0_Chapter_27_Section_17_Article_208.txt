Article 208
Implementation contracts
1.   Without prejudice to Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU, where the implementation of the action or work programme requires the award of a contract, the beneficiary may award the contract in accordance with its usual purchasing practices provided that the contract is awarded to the tender offering best value for money or, as appropriate, to the tender offering the lowest price, while avoiding any conflict of interests.
2.   Where implementation of the action or work programme requires the award of a contract with a value of more than EUR 60 000, the authorising officer responsible may, if duly justified, require the beneficiary to abide by special rules in addition to those referred to in paragraph 1.
Those special rules shall be based on rules contained in this Regulation and shall be proportionate to the value of the contracts concerned, the relative size of the Union contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. Such special rules shall be included in the grant agreement.
