Article 29
Transfers by Union institutions other than the Commission
1.   Any Union institution other than the Commission may, within its own section of the budget, transfer appropriations:
(a)
from one title to another up to a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget line from which the transfer is made;
(b)
from one chapter to another without limit.
2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this Article, three weeks before making a transfer, as referred to in paragraph 1, the Union institution shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of its intention to do so. In the event that duly justified objections are raised within that period by either the European Parliament or the Council, the procedure laid down in Article 31 shall apply.
3.   Any Union institution other than the Commission may propose to the European Parliament and to the Council, within its own section of the budget, transfers from one title to another exceeding the limit referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article. Those transfers shall be subject to the procedure laid down in Article 31.
4.   Any Union institution other than the Commission may, within its own section of the budget, make transfers within articles without informing the European Parliament and the Council beforehand.
