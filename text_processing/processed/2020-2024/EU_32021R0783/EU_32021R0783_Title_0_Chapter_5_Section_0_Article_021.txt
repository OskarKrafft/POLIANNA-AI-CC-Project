Article 21
Information, communication and publicity
1.   The recipients of Union funding shall acknowledge the origin of those funds and ensure the visibility of the Union funding, in particular when promoting the projects and their results, by providing coherent, effective and proportionate targeted information to multiple audiences, including the media and the public. For this purpose, the recipients shall use the LIFE Programme logo, which is depicted in Annex III. All durable goods acquired in the framework of the LIFE Programme shall bear the LIFE Programme logo except in cases specified by the Commission. Where the use of the LIFE Programme logo is not feasible, the LIFE Programme shall be mentioned in all communication activities, including on notice boards at strategic places visible to the public.
2.   The Commission shall implement information and communication actions relating to the LIFE Programme, to actions taken pursuant to the LIFE Programme and to the results obtained. Financial resources allocated to the LIFE Programme shall also contribute to the corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union, insofar as those priorities are related to the objectives referred to in Article 3.
