That decrease shall not go beyond the EAFRD amounts reallocated to the measures referred to in Article 6a of this Regulation and in Article 18(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, and shall not exceed 15 percentage points of the overall share of the EAFRD contribution set in the rural development programmes for the measures referred to in Article 59(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013. For that purpose, the overall share of the EAFRD contribution set in the rural development programmes as planned at the time of the extension of the period of duration of programmes supported by the EAFRD until 31 December 2022, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, shall be taken into account. The overall share reserved for the measures referred to in Article 59(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 shall not be lower than the minimum threshold set out in that Article. The same decrease in percentage points may be applied to the additional resources referred to in Article 58a(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 without reallocating funds to the measures referred to in Article 6a of this Regulation and in Article 18(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.’
