Article 7
Volunteering under the ‘participation of young people in solidarity activities’ strand
1.   Volunteering shall:
(a)
include a learning and training component;
(b)
not be a substitute for traineeships or jobs;
(c)
not be equated with employment; and
(d)
be based on a written volunteering agreement.
The agreement referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph shall set out the rights and obligations of the parties to that agreement, the duration and location of deployment and a description of the tasks involved. Such an agreement shall refer to the terms of the participants’ insurance coverage and, where appropriate, to the relevant clearance requirements, in accordance with applicable national law.
2.   Volunteering may take place in a country other than the participant’s country of residence (‘cross-border volunteering’) or in the participant’s country of residence (‘in-country volunteering’). In-country volunteering shall be open to the participation of all young people, in particular young people with fewer opportunities.
