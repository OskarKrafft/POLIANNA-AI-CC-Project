Article 10
Alternative policy measures
1.   Where Member States decide to fulfil their obligations to achieve the savings required under Article 8(1) by way of alternative policy measures, they shall ensure, without prejudice to Article 8(8) and (9), that the energy savings required under Article 8(1) are achieved among final customers.
2.   For all measures other than those relating to taxation, Member States shall put in place measurement, control and verification systems under which documented verification is carried out on at least a statistically significant proportion and representative sample of the energy efficiency improvement measures put in place by the participating or entrusted parties. The measurement, control and verification shall be carried out independently of the participating or entrusted parties.
3.   Member States shall inform the Commission, as part of the integrated national energy and climate progress reports submitted pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, on the measurement, control and verification systems put in place, including methods used, issues identified and how they were addressed.
4.   When reporting a taxation measure, Member States shall demonstrate how the effectiveness of the price signal, such as tax rate and visibility over time, has been ensured in the design of the taxation measure. Where there is a decrease in the tax rate, Member States shall justify how the taxation measures still result in new energy savings.
