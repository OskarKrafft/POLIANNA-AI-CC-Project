Article 13
Metering for natural gas
1.   Member States shall ensure that, in so far as technically possible, financially reasonable, and proportionate to the potential energy savings, natural gas final customers are provided with competitively priced individual meters that accurately reflect the final customer’s actual energy consumption and that provide information on actual time of use.
Such a competitively priced individual meter shall always be provided when:
(a)
an existing meter is replaced, unless this is technically impossible or not cost-effective in relation to the estimated potential savings in the long term;
(b)
a new connection is made in a new building or a building undergoes major renovations within the meaning of Directive 2010/31/EU.
2.   Where, and to the extent that, Member States implement smart metering systems and roll out smart meters for natural gas in accordance with Directive 2009/73/EC:
(a)
they shall ensure that the metering systems provide to final customers information on actual time of use and that the objectives of energy efficiency and benefits for final customers are fully taken into account when establishing the minimum functionalities of the meters and the obligations imposed on market participants;
(b)
they shall ensure the security of the smart meters and data communication, and the privacy of final customers, in compliance with relevant Union data protection and privacy law;
(c)
they shall require that appropriate advice and information be given to customers at the time of installation of smart meters, in particular about their full potential with regard to meter reading management and the monitoring of energy consumption.
