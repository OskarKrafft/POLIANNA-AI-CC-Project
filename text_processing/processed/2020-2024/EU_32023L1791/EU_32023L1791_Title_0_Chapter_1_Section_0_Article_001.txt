Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1.   This Directive establishes a common framework of measures to promote energy efficiency within the Union in order to ensure that the Union’s targets on energy efficiency are met and enables further energy efficiency improvements. The aim of that common framework is to contribute to the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (35) and to the Union’s security of energy supply by reducing its dependence on energy imports, including fossil fuels.
This Directive lays down rules designed to implement energy efficiency as a priority across all sectors, remove barriers in the energy market and overcome market failures that impede efficiency in the supply, transmission, storage and use of energy. It also provides for the establishment of indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030.
This Directive contributes to the implementation of the energy efficiency first principle, thus also contributing to the Union being an inclusive, fair and prosperous society with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy.
2.   The requirements laid down in this Directive are minimum requirements and shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent measures. Such measures shall comply with Union law. Where national legislation provides for more stringent measures, the Member State shall notify such legislation to the Commission.
