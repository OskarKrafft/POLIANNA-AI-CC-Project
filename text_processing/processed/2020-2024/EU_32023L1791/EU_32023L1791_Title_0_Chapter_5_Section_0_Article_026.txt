2.   Member States may also choose, as an alternative to the criteria set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, sustainability performance criteria based on the amount of GHG emissions from the district heating and cooling system per unit of heat or cold delivered to the customers, taking into consideration measures implemented to fulfil the obligation pursuant to Article 24(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. When choosing those criteria, an efficient district heating and cooling system shall have the following maximum amount of GHG emissions per unit of heat or cold delivered to the customers:
(a)
until 31 December 2025: 200 grams/kWh;
(b)
from 1 January 2026: 150 grams/kWh;
(c)
from 1 January 2035: 100 grams/kWh;
(d)
from 1 January 2045: 50 grams/kWh;
(e)
from 1 January 2050: 0 grams/kWh.
3.   Member States may choose to apply the criteria of GHG emissions per unit of heat or cold for any given period referred to in paragraph 2, points (a) to (e), of this Article. If they choose to do so, they shall notify the Commission by 11 January 2024 for the period referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), of this Article and at least six months before the beginning of the relevant periods referred to in paragraph 2, points (b) to (e), of this Article. Such a notification shall include the measures implemented to fulfil the obligation pursuant to Article 24(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 if they have not already been notified in the latest update of their national energy and climate plan.
4.   In order for a district heating and cooling system to qualify as efficient, Member States shall ensure that where it is built or its supply units are substantially refurbished, the district heating or cooling system meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1 or 2 applicable at the time when it starts or continues its operation after the refurbishment. In addition, Member States shall ensure that when a district heating and cooling system is built or its supply units are substantially refurbished:
(a)
there is no increase in the use of fossil fuels other than natural gas in existing heat sources compared to the annual consumption averaged over the previous three calendar years of full operation before refurbishment; and
(b)
any new heat sources in that system do not use fossil fuels, except natural gas, if built or substantially refurbished until 2030.
5.   Member States shall ensure that as from 1 January 2025, and every five years thereafter, operators of all existing district heating and cooling systems with a total heat and cold output exceeding 5 MW and which do not meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1, points (b) to (e), prepare a plan to ensure more efficient consumption of primary energy, to reduce distribution losses and to increase the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling supply. The plan shall include measures to meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1, points (b) to (e), and shall require approval by the competent authority.
6.   Member States shall ensure that data centres with a total rated energy input exceeding 1 MW utilise the waste heat or other waste heat recovery applications unless they can show that it is not technically or economically feasible in accordance with the assessment referred to in paragraph 7.
7.   In order to assess the economic feasibility of increasing energy efficiency of heat and cooling supply, Member States shall ensure that an installation level cost-benefit analysis in accordance with Annex XI is carried out where the following installations are newly planned or substantially refurbished:
(a)
a thermal electricity generation installation with an average annual total energy input exceeding 10 MW, in order to assess the cost and benefits of providing for the operation of the installation as a high-efficiency cogeneration installation;
(b)
an industrial installation with an average annual total energy input exceeding 8 MW in order to assess utilisation of the waste heat on-site and off-site;
(c)
a service facility with an annual average total energy input exceeding 7 MW, such as wastewater treatment facilities and LNG facilities, in order to assess utilisation of waste heat on-site and off-site;
(d)
a data centre with a total rated energy input exceeding 1 MW level in order to assess the cost and benefit analysis, including, but not limited to, technical feasibility, cost-efficiency and the impact on energy efficiency and local heat demand, including seasonal variation, of utilising the waste heat to satisfy economically justified demand, and of the connection of that installation to a district heating network or an efficient/RES-based district cooling system or other waste heat recovery applications.
The analysis referred to in the first subparagraph, point (d), shall consider cooling system solutions that allow removing or capturing the waste heat at useful temperature level with minimal ancillary energy inputs.
Member States shall aim to remove barriers for the utilisation of waste heat and provide support for the uptake of waste heat where the installations are newly planned or refurbished.
The fitting of equipment to capture carbon dioxide produced by a combustion installation with a view to it being geologically stored as provided for in Directive 2009/31/EC shall not be considered as refurbishment for the purpose of points (b) and (c) of this paragraph.
Member States shall require the cost-benefit analysis to be carried out in cooperation with the companies responsible for the operation of the facility.
8.   Member States may exempt from paragraph 7:
(a)
peak load and back-up electricity generating installations which are planned to operate under 1 500 operating hours per year as a rolling average over a period of five years, based on a verification procedure established by the Member States ensuring that this exemption criterion is met;
(b)
installations that need to be located close to a geological storage site approved under Directive 2009/31/EC;
(c)
data centres whose waste heat is or will be used in a district heating network or directly for space heating, domestic hot water preparation or other uses in the building or group of buildings or facilities where it is located.
Member States may also lay down thresholds, expressed in terms of the amount of available useful waste heat, the demand for heat or the distances between industrial installations and district heating networks, for exempting individual installations from paragraph 7, points (c) and (d).
Member States shall notify exemptions adopted under this paragraph to the Commission.
9.   Member States shall adopt authorisation criteria as referred to in Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, or equivalent permit criteria, in order to:
(a)
take into account the outcome of the comprehensive assessment referred to in Article 25(1);
(b)
ensure that the requirements laid down in paragraph 7 are fulfilled;
(c)
take into account the outcome of the cost-benefit analysis referred to in paragraph 7.
10.   Member States may exempt individual installations from being required, by the authorisation or equivalent permit criteria referred to in paragraph 9, to implement options whose benefits exceed their costs, if there are imperative reasons of law, ownership or finance for doing so. In those cases the Member State concerned shall submit a reasoned decision to the Commission within three months of the date of taking that decision. The Commission may issue an opinion on the decision within three months of its receipt.
11.   Paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 of this Article shall apply to installations covered by Directive 2010/75/EU without prejudice to the requirements laid down in that Directive.
12.   Member States shall collect information on cost-benefit analyses carried out in accordance with paragraph 7, points (a) to (d). That information should contain at least the data on available heat supply amounts and heat parameters, number of planned operating hours every year and geographical location of the sites. Those data shall be published with due respect for their potential sensitivity.
13.   On the basis of the harmonised efficiency reference values referred to in Annex III, point (d), Member States shall ensure that the origin of electricity produced from high-efficiency cogeneration can be guaranteed according to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria laid down by each Member State. They shall ensure that that guarantee of origin complies with the requirements laid down in, and contains at least the information specified in, Annex XII. Member States shall mutually recognise their guarantees of origin, exclusively as proof of the information referred to in this paragraph. Any refusal to recognise a guarantee of origin as such proof, in particular for reasons relating to the prevention of fraud, shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. Member States shall notify the Commission of such refusal and set out the reasons for it. In the event of a refusal to recognise a guarantee of origin, the Commission may adopt a decision to compel the refusing party to recognise it, in particular with regard to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria on which such recognition is based.
14.   Member States shall ensure that any available support for cogeneration is subject to the electricity produced originating from high-efficiency cogeneration and the waste heat being effectively used to achieve primary energy savings. Public support to cogeneration and district heating generation and networks shall be subject to State aid rules, where applicable.
