Article 23
Partnerships for energy efficiency
1.   By 11 October 2024, the Commission shall assess whether energy efficiency is covered by existing partnerships. If the assessment shows that energy efficiency is not sufficiently covered by existing partnerships, the Commission shall establish sector-specific energy efficiency partnerships at Union level, with sub-partnerships per missing sector, by bringing together key stakeholders, including the social partners, in sectors such as ICT, transport, finance and building, in an inclusive and representative manner.
If a partnership is established, the Commission shall appoint, where appropriate, a chair for each Union sector-specific energy efficiency partnership.
2.   The partnerships referred to in paragraph 1 shall aim to facilitate climate and energy transition dialogues between the relevant actors and encourage sectors to draw up energy efficiency roadmaps in order to map available measures and technological options to achieve energy savings, prepare for renewable energy and decarbonise the sectors.
Such roadmaps would make a valuable contribution in assisting sectors in planning the necessary investments needed to reach the objectives of this Directive and of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 as well as facilitate cross-border cooperation between actors to strengthen the internal market.
