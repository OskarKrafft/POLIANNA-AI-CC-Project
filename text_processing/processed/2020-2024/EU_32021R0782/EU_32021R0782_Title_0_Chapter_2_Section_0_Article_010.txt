Article 10
Access to traffic and travel information
1.   Infrastructure managers shall distribute real-time data relating to the arrival and the departure of trains to railway undertakings, ticket vendors, tour operators and station managers.
2.   Railway undertakings shall provide other railway undertakings, ticket vendors and tour operators that sell their services with access to minimum travel information set out in Annex II, Parts I and II, and to the operations on reservation systems referred to in Annex II, Part III.
3.   Information shall be distributed and access shall be granted in a non-discriminatory manner and without undue delay. A one-off request shall be sufficient to have continuous access to information. The infrastructure manager and the railway undertaking obliged to make available information in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 may request the conclusion of a contract or other arrangement on whose basis information is distributed or access is granted.
The terms and conditions of any contract or arrangement for the use of the information shall not unnecessarily restrict possibilities for its reuse or be used to restrict competition.
Railway undertakings may require from other railway undertakings, tour operators and ticket vendors a fair, reasonable and proportionate financial compensation for the costs incurred in providing the access, and infrastructure managers may require compensation in accordance with the applicable rules.
4.   Information shall be distributed and access shall be provided by appropriate technical means, such as application programming interfaces.
5.   To the extent that the information covered by paragraphs 1 or 2 is provided in accordance with other Union legal acts, in particular Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/1926 (14), the corresponding obligations under this Article shall be deemed to have been complied with.
