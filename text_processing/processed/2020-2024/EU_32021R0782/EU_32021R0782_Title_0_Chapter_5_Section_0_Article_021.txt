Article 21
Right to transport
1.   Railway undertakings and station managers shall, with the active involvement of representative organisations and, where relevant, representatives of persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility, establish or have in place non-discriminatory access rules for the transport of persons with disabilities, including their personal assistants recognised as such in accordance with national practices, and persons with reduced mobility. Those rules shall take into account the agreements referred to in point 4.4.3 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1300/2014, in particular with regard to the entity responsible for providing assistance to persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility.
2.   Reservations and tickets shall be offered to persons with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility at no additional cost. A railway undertaking, ticket vendor or tour operator may not refuse to accept a reservation from, or to issue a ticket to, a person with disabilities or a person with reduced mobility, or require that such person be accompanied by another person, unless this is strictly necessary in order to comply with the access rules referred to in paragraph 1.
