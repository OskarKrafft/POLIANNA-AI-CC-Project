Article 34
Exchange of information and cross-border cooperation between national enforcement bodies
1.   Where different bodies are designated under Articles 31 and 33, reporting mechanisms shall be set up to ensure the exchange of information between them, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in order to help the national enforcement body to carry out its tasks of supervision and enforcement, and so that the complaint-handling body designated under Article 33 can collect the information necessary to examine individual complaints.
2.   National enforcement bodies shall exchange information on their work and decision-making principles and practices for the purpose of coordination. The Commission shall support them in that task.
3.   In complex cases such as those involving multiple complaints or a number of operators, cross-border travel or accidents on the territory of a Member State other than that which granted the undertaking’s licence, and in particular where it is unclear which national enforcement body is competent, or where it would facilitate or accelerate the resolution of the complaint, national enforcement bodies shall cooperate to identify a lead body, which shall serve as a single point of contact for passengers. All national enforcement bodies involved shall cooperate to facilitate the resolution of the complaint, including by sharing information, assisting with the translation of documents and providing information on the circumstances of incidents. Passengers shall be informed which body is acting as lead body.
