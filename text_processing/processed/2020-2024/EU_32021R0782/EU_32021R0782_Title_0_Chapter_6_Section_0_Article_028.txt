Complaints
1.   Each railway undertaking and station manager of a station handling on average more than 10 000 passengers per day over a year shall set up a complaint-handling mechanism for the rights and obligations covered by this Regulation in their respective fields of responsibility. They shall make their contact details and working language, or languages, widely known to passengers. This mechanism shall not apply for the purposes of Chapter III.
2.   Passengers may submit a complaint to any railway undertaking or station manager regarding their respective fields of responsibility via the mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1. Such a complaint shall be submitted within three months of the incident that it concerns. Within one month of receiving the complaint, the addressee shall either give a reasoned reply or, in justified cases, inform the passenger that he or she will receive a reply within a period of less than three months from the date of receipt of the complaint. Railway undertakings and station managers shall keep the data necessary to assess the complaint for the duration of the entire complaint-handling procedure, including the complaint-handling procedures referred to in Articles 33 and 34, and shall make that data available to national enforcement bodies upon request.
3.   Details of the complaint-handling procedure shall be accessible to the public, including to persons with disabilities and to persons with reduced mobility. This information shall be available upon request at least in the official language or languages of the Member State in which the railway undertaking is operating.
4.   The railway undertaking shall publish in the report referred to in Article 29(2) the number and categories of received complaints and of processed complaints, the response time and the possible improvement actions undertaken.
