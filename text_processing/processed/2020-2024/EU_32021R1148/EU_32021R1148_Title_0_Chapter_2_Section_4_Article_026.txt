Article 26
Cumulative and alternative financing
1.   An action that has received a contribution under the Instrument may also receive a contribution from any other Union programme, including funds under shared management, provided that the contributions do not cover the same costs. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution to the action. The cumulative financing shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action. The support from the different Union programmes may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.

(a)
they have been assessed in a call for proposals under the Instrument;
(b)
they comply with the minimum quality requirements of that call for proposals; and
(c)
