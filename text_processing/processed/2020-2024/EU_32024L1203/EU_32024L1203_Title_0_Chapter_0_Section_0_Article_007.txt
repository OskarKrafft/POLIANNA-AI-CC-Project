3.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, at least for legal persons held liable pursuant to Article 6(1), criminal offences covered by Article 3(2) are punishable by criminal or non-criminal fines, the amount of which shall be proportionate to the gravity of the conduct and to the individual, financial and other circumstances of the legal person concerned. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the maximum level of such fines is not less than:
(a)
for criminal offences covered by Article 3(2), points (a) to (l), and points (p), (s) and (t):
(i)
5 % of the total worldwide turnover of the legal person, either in the business year preceding that in which the offence was committed, or in the business year preceding that of the decision to impose the fine, or

Member States may establish rules for cases where it is not possible to determine the amount of the fine on the basis of the total worldwide turnover of the legal person in the business year preceding that in which the offence was committed, or in the business year preceding that of the decision to impose the fine.
4.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons held liable pursuant to Article 6 for the criminal offences covered by Article 3(3) are punishable by more severe criminal or non-criminal penalties or measures than those applicable for the criminal offences covered by Article 3(2).
