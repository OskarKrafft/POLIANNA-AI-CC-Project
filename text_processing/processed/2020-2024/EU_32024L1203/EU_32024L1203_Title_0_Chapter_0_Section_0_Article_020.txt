Article 20
Cooperation between Member States and the Commission, and Union bodies, offices or agencies
Where environmental criminal offences are suspected to be of a cross-border nature, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall consider referring the information related to those offences to appropriate competent bodies.
Without prejudice to the rules on cross-border cooperation and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, the Member States, Eurojust, Europol, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the European Anti-Fraud Office and the Commission shall, within their respective competences, cooperate with each other in the fight against the criminal offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4. To that end, Eurojust shall, where appropriate, provide the technical and operational assistance needed by the competent national authorities to facilitate coordination of their investigations. The Commission may, where appropriate, provide assistance.
