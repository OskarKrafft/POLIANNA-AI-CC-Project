Article 6
Liability of legal persons
1.   Member States shall ensure that legal persons can be held liable for criminal offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 where such offences have been committed for the benefit of those legal persons by any person who has a leading position within the legal person concerned, acting either individually or as part of an organ of that legal person, based on:
(a)
a power of representation of the legal person;
(b)
an authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or
(c)
an authority to exercise control within the legal person.
2.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in paragraph 1 has made possible the commission of a criminal offence referred to in Articles 3 and 4 for the benefit of the legal person by a person under its authority.
3.   Liability of legal persons under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not preclude criminal proceedings against natural persons who commit, incite or are accessories to the criminal offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4.
