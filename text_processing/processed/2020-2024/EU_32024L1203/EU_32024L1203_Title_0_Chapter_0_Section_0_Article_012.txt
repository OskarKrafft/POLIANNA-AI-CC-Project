1.   Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to establish its jurisdiction over the criminal offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 where:
(a)
the offence was committed in whole or in part within its territory;
(b)
the offence was committed on board a ship or an aircraft registered in the Member State concerned, or flying its flag;
(c)
the damage which is one of the constituent elements of the offence occurred on its territory; or
(d)
the offender is one of its nationals.
2.   A Member State shall inform the Commission where it decides to extend its jurisdiction to one or more criminal offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 which have been committed outside its territory, where:
(a)
the offender is a habitual resident in its territory;
(b)
the offence is committed for the benefit of a legal person established in its territory;
(c)
the offence is committed against one of its nationals or its habitual residents; or
(d)
the offence has created a severe risk for the environment on its territory.
Where a criminal offence referred to in Articles 3 and 4 falls within the jurisdiction of more than one Member State, those Member States shall cooperate to determine which Member State is to conduct the criminal proceedings. The matter shall, where appropriate and in accordance with Article 12(2) of Council Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA (42), be referred to Eurojust.
3.   In cases referred to in paragraph 1, points (c) and (d), Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the exercise of their jurisdiction is not subject to the condition that a prosecution can be initiated only following a denunciation from the State of the place where the criminal offence was committed.
