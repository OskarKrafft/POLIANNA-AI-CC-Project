Article 15
Publication of information in the public interest and access to justice for the public concerned
Member States shall ensure that persons affected or likely to be affected by the criminal offences referred to in Articles 3 and 4 of this Directive and persons having a sufficient interest or maintaining the impairment of a right, as well as non-governmental organisations that promote environmental protection and meet requirements under national law, have appropriate procedural rights in proceedings concerning those offences, where such procedural rights for the public concerned exist in the Member State in proceedings concerning other criminal offences, for instance as a civil party. In such cases, Member States shall also ensure, in accordance with their national law, that the information on the progress of the proceedings is shared with the public concerned, where that is done in proceedings concerning other criminal offences.
