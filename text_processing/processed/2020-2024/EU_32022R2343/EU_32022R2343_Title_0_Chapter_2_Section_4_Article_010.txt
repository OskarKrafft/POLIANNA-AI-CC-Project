Article 10
Non-entangling and biodegradable FADs
1.   Union fishing vessels shall use non-entangling designs and materials for the construction of FADs ensuring that the surface structure of the FAD is not covered or is covered only with non-meshed material. If a sub-surface component is used, it shall not be made from netting but from non-meshed materials, such as ropes or canvas sheets.
2.   Union fishing vessels shall endeavour to transition to the use of biodegradable FADs in all circumstances except for materials used for the instrumented buoys.
3.   Operators shall endeavour to conduct trials using biodegradable materials to facilitate the transition to the use of only biodegradable material for drifting FADs construction by their fleets.
