(b)
require that, when imported into the territory of a CPC, the species covered by statistical document programmes caught by Union fishing vessels in the Area shall be accompanied by statistical documents; and
(c)
cooperate, when importing catch of species covered by statistical document programmes, with the flag Member States of vessels catching those species to ensure that statistical documents are not forged or do not contain misinformation.
3.   Member States shall notify the Commission, or a body designated by it, of any factual information showing that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that vessels not registered in the IOTC record are engaged in fishing for or transhipment of IOTC species in the Area. The Commission, or a body designated by it, shall notify the IOTC Secretariat of that information immediately.
