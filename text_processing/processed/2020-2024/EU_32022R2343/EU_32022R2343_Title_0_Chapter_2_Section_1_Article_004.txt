Article 4
Discard ban
1.   Union purse seine vessels shall retain on board and land all catches of tropical tunas (bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)), except where the master of the vessel determines that:
(a)
fish are unfit for human consumption, or
(b)
there is insufficient storage capacity to accommodate tropical tuna and the non-targeted species caught during the final set of a trip.
2.   Fish referred to in paragraph 1, point (b), may only be discarded if the master and crew attempt to release the tropical tuna and the non-targeted species alive as soon as possible, while taking into consideration the safety of the crew, and no further fishing is undertaken after the discard until the tropical tuna and the non-targeted species on board the vessel have been landed or transhipped.
3.   The master of a Union fishing vessel shall record the exceptions referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), in the relevant logbook, including estimated tonnage and species composition of discarded fish, and estimated tonnage and species composition of retained fish from that set.
4.   For the purposes of this Article, non-targeted species includes non-targeted tuna species, as well as rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), triggerfish (family Balistidae), billfish (families Xyphiidae and Istiophoridae), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) and barracuda (family Sphyraenidae).
