Article 45
Inspection procedure
1.   This Article shall apply in addition to the rules on the inspection procedure laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008.
2.   Inspectors from port Member States shall be properly qualified inspectors authorised for that purpose, and shall carry a valid document of identity that they shall present to the master of the vessel to be inspected.
3.   As a minimum standard, port Member States shall ensure that their inspectors carry out the tasks set out in Annex II to CMM 16/11. Port Member States, in carrying out inspections in their ports, shall require the master of the vessel to give inspectors all necessary assistance and information, and to present relevant material and documents as may be required, or certified copies thereof.
4.   In the written report of the results of each inspection, each port Member State shall, as a minimum, include the information set out in Annex III to CMM 16/11. Within three working days of the completion of the inspection, the port Member State shall transmit a copy of the inspection report and, upon request, an original or certified copy thereof, to the master of the inspected vessel, to the flag State, to the Commission, or to a body designated by it. The Commission, or the body designated by it, shall forward the report to the IOTC Secretariat.
5.   By 15 June of each year, each port Member State shall submit to the Commission the list of fishing vessels not flagged to that port Member State which have landed in its ports tuna and tuna-like species caught in the IOTC area the preceding calendar year. That information shall detail the catch composition by weight and species landed. The Commission shall forward that information to the IOTC Secretariat by 1 July of each year.
