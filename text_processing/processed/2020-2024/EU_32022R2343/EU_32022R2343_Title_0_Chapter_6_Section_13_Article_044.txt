Article 44
Port inspection
1.   Each year, each port Member State shall inspect in its designated ports at least 5 % of all landings or transhipments related to IOTC species made by fishing vessels that are not flagged to that port Member State.
2.   Inspections shall involve the monitoring of the entire landing or transhipment and include a cross-check between the quantities, by species, recorded in the prior notice and the quantities by species actually landed or transhipped. When the landing or transhipment is completed, the inspector shall verify and note the quantities by species of fish remaining on board.
