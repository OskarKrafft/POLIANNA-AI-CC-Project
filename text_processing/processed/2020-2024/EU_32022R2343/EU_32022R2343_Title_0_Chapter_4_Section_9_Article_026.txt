Article 26
Authorisation of fishing vessels
1.   Member States shall issue an authorisation to fish for IOTC species for fishing vessels flying their flag in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2403.
2.   Member States shall submit to the Commission an updated template of the official authorisation to fish outside national jurisdictions, and update the information in the template whenever necessary. The Commission shall send this information to the IOTC Secretariat without delay. The template shall include the following information:
(a)
name of the competent authority;
(b)
name and contact of personnel of the competent authority;
(c)
signature of the personnel of the competent authority; and
(d)
official stamp of the competent authority.
3.   The template referred to in paragraph 2 shall be used exclusively for monitoring, control and surveillance purposes. A difference between the template and the authorisation carried onboard the vessel shall not constitute an infringement, but shall prompt the controlling State to clarify the issue with the identified competent authority of the flag State of the vessel in question.
