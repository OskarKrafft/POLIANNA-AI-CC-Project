Article 49
Draft IOTC IUU vessel list
1.   If the Commission receives official notification of the inclusion of a Union fishing vessel in the draft IOTC IUU vessel list from the IOTC Secretariat, it shall transmit that notification, including the supporting evidence and any other documented information provided by the IOTC Secretariat, to the flag Member State concerned.
2.   The Member State concerned shall provide comments no later than 30 days in advance of the annual meeting of the IOTC Compliance Committee. The Commission shall examine and forward that information to the IOTC Secretariat at least 15 days in advance of the annual meeting of the Compliance Committee.
3.   Once notified by the Commission, the authorities of the flag Member State concerned shall:
(a)
notify the owner and the operators of the fishing vessel of its inclusion in the draft IOTC IUU vessel list and of the possible consequences that may result from that inclusion being confirmed in the IUU vessel list adopted by the IOTC; and
(b)
closely monitor the vessels included in the draft IOTC IUU vessel list, in order to determine their activities and detect possible changes of name, flag, or registered owner of those vessels.
