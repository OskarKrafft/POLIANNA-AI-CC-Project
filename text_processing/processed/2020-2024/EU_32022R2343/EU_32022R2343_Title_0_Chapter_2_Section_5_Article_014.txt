Article 14
Landing of transhipped catches by Union carrier vessels
1.   By way of derogation from Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, the period for prior notification shall be at least 48 hours before the estimated time of arrival at the port.
2.   Member States where transhipped catches are landed shall take the appropriate measures to verify the accuracy of the information received and shall cooperate with the flag Member State of the carrier vessel, the port State where the transhipment took place and the flag states of the catching fishing vessels involved to ensure that landings are consistent with the catch amount reported for each fishing vessel. That verification shall be carried out in such a way that the carrier vessel suffers the minimum interference and inconvenience and that degradation of the fish is avoided.
3.   The master of a Union carrier vessel landing in a third country shall, at least 48 hours before entry into port and in addition to the prior notification referred to in paragraph 1, give prior notification in accordance with the national legislation of the third country in whose port the vessel intends to land transhipped catches. The master shall also send the IOTC transhipment declaration in one of the official languages of the IOTC to the competent authorities of the State in which transhipped catches are to be landed and shall not land before being authorised to do so.
4.   Where landings take place in a third country, the master of the carrier vessel shall cooperate with the port state authorities.
5.   Flag Member States of the Union fishing vessels shall include details on the transhipments by its vessels in their reports in accordance with Article 51(5).
