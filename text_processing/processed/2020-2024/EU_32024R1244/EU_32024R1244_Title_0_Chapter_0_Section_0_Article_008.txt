Article 8
Data on the release of pollutants from diffuse sources
1.   The Commission, assisted by the Agency, shall include in the Portal data on the release of pollutants from diffuse sources, where such data exist and have already been reported by Member States.
2.   The data available on the Portal shall allow users to search for and identify the release of pollutants from diffuse sources according to an adequate geographical disaggregation and shall include information on the type of methodology used to derive the data.
3.   Where it determines that no data on the release of pollutants from diffuse sources exist, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 in order to supplement this Regulation by initiating reporting on the release of relevant pollutants from one or more diffuse sources using, where appropriate, internationally approved methodologies.
