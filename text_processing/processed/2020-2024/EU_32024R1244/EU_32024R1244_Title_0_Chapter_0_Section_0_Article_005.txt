(b)
installation;
(c)

(e)
pollutant, waste or resource, as appropriate;
(f)
the environmental medium, namely air, water or land, into which the pollutant is released;
(g)
off-site transfers of waste and, as appropriate, their destination;
(h)
off-site transfers of pollutants in waste water;
(i)
diffuse sources; and

2.   The Portal shall be designed so as to make it as easy as possible for the public to access the data and to allow the data, under normal operating conditions, to be continuously and readily accessible on the internet.
