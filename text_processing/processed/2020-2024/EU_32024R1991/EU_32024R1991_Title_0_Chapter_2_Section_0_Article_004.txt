Article 4
Restoration of terrestrial, coastal and freshwater ecosystems
1.   Member States shall put in place the restoration measures that are necessary to improve to good condition areas of habitat types listed in Annex I which are not in good condition. Such restoration measures shall be put in place:
(a)
by 2030 on at least 30 % of the total area of all habitat types listed in Annex I that is not in good condition, as quantified in the national restoration plan referred to in Article 15;
(b)
by 2040 on at least 60 % and by 2050, on at least 90 % of the area of each group of habitat types listed in Annex I that is not in good condition, as quantified in the national restoration plan referred to in Article 15.
For the purpose of this paragraph, Member States shall, as appropriate, until 2030 give priority to restoration measures in areas that are located in Natura 2000 sites.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), Member States may, where duly justified and for the purposes of that paragraph, exclude from the relevant group of habitat types very common and widespread habitat types that cover more than 3 % of their European territory.
Where a Member State applies the derogation referred to in the first subparagraph, the Member State shall put in place restoration measures:
(a)
by 2050 on an area representing at least 80 % of the area that is not in good condition for each of those habitat types;
(b)
by 2030 on at least one third of the percentage referred to in point (a); and
(c)
by 2040 on at least two thirds of the percentage referred to in point (a).
The derogation referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be applied if it is ensured that the percentage referred to in point (a) of the second subparagraph does not prevent the favourable conservation status for each of those habitat types, from being reached or maintained at national biogeographical level.
3.   If a Member State applies the derogation pursuant to paragraph 2, the obligation set out in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (a), shall apply to the total area of all remaining habitat types listed in Annex I that is not in good condition and the obligation set out in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (b), shall apply to the remaining areas of the relevant groups of habitat types listed in Annex I that are not in good condition.
4.   Member States shall put in place the restoration measures that are necessary to re-establish the habitat types listed in Annex I in areas where those habitat types do not occur, with the aim of reaching the favourable reference area for those habitat types. Such measures shall be in place on areas representing at least 30 % of the additional surface needed to reach the total favourable reference area for each group of habitat types listed in Annex I, as quantified in the national restoration plan referred to in Article 15, by 2030, on areas representing at least 60 % of that surface by 2040, and on 100 % of that surface by 2050.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4 of this Article, if a Member State considers that it is not possible to put in place restoration measures by 2050 that are necessary to reach the favourable reference area for a specific habitat type on 100 % of the surface, the Member State concerned may set a lower percentage at a level between 90 % and 100 % in its national restoration plan as referred to in Article 15 and provide adequate justification. In such a case, the Member State shall gradually put in place restoration measures that are necessary to achieve that lower percentage by 2050. By 2030, those restoration measures shall cover at least 30 % of the additional surface needed to achieve such lower percentage by 2050, and by 2040, they shall cover at least 60 % of the additional surface needed to achieve such lower percentage by 2050.
6.   If a Member State applies the derogation pursuant to paragraph 5 to specific habitat types, the obligation set out in paragraph 4 shall apply to the remaining habitat types that are part of the groups of habitat types listed in Annex I to which those specific habitat types belong.
7.   Member States shall put in place restoration measures for the terrestrial, coastal and freshwater habitats of the species listed in Annexes II, IV and V to Directive 92/43/EEC and of the terrestrial, coastal and freshwater habitats of wild birds falling within the scope of Directive 2009/147/EC that are, in addition to the restoration measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article, necessary to improve the quality and quantity of those habitats, including by re-establishing them, and to enhance connectivity, until sufficient quality and quantity of those habitats is achieved.
8.   The determination of the most suitable areas for restoration measures in accordance with paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 of this Article shall be based on the best available knowledge and the latest scientific evidence of the condition of the habitat types listed in Annex I to this Regulation, measured by the structure and functions which are necessary for their long-term maintenance, including their typical species, as referred to in Article 1, point (e), of Directive 92/43/EEC, and of the quality and quantity of the habitats of the species referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article, making use of information reported under Article 17 of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 12 of Directive 2009/147/EC, and where appropriate taking into account the diversity of situations in various regions as referred to in Article 14(16), point (c), of this Regulation.
9.   Member States shall ensure, by 2030 at the latest, that the condition of habitat types is known for at least 90 % of the area distributed over all habitat types listed in Annex I and that by 2040, the condition of all areas of habitat types listed in Annex I is known.
10.   The restoration measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 shall consider the need for improved connectivity between the habitat types listed in Annex I and take into account the ecological requirements of the species referred to in paragraph 7 that occur in those habitat types.
11.   Member States shall put in place measures which shall aim to ensure that the areas that are subject to restoration measures in accordance with paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 show a continuous improvement in the condition of the habitat types listed in Annex I until good condition is reached, and a continuous improvement of the quality of the habitats of the species referred to in paragraph 7, until the sufficient quality of those habitats is reached.
Without prejudice to Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States shall put in place measures which shall aim to ensure that areas in which good condition has been reached, and in which the sufficient quality of the habitats of the species has been reached, do not significantly deteriorate.
12.   Without prejudice to Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States shall, by the date of publication of their national restoration plans in accordance with Article 17(6) of this Regulation, endeavour to put in place necessary measures with the aim of preventing significant deterioration of areas where the habitat types listed in Annex I to this Regulation occur and which are in good condition or are necessary to meet the restoration targets set out in paragraph 17 of this Article.
13.   With regard to paragraphs 11 and 12 of this Article, outside Natura 2000 sites, Member States may, in the absence of alternatives, apply the non-deterioration requirements set out in those paragraphs at the level of each biogeographical region of their territory for each habitat type and each habitat of species, provided that the Member State concerned notifies its intention to apply this paragraph to the Commission by 19 February 2025 and fulfils the obligations set out in Article 15(3), point (g), Article 20(1) point (j), Article 21(1) and Article 21(2), point (b).
14.   Outside Natura 2000 sites, the obligation set out in paragraph 11 shall not apply to deterioration caused by:
(a)

force majeure, including natural disasters;
(b)
unavoidable habitat transformations which are directly caused by climate change;
(c)
a plan or project of overriding public interest for which no less damaging alternative solutions are available, to be determined on a case by case basis; or
(d)
action or inaction by third countries for which the Member State concerned is not responsible.
15.   Outside Natura 2000 sites, the obligation set out in paragraph 12 shall not apply to deterioration caused by:
(a)

force majeure, including natural disasters;
(b)
unavoidable habitat transformations which are directly caused by climate change;
(c)
a plan or project of overriding public interest for which no less damaging alternative solutions are available; or
(d)
action or inaction by third countries for which the Member State concerned is not responsible.
16.   Within Natura 2000 sites, the non-fulfilment of the obligations set out in paragraphs 11 and 12 is justified if it is caused by:
(a)

force majeure, including natural disasters;
(b)
unavoidable habitat transformations which are directly caused by climate change; or
(c)
a plan or project authorised in accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC.
17.   Member States shall ensure that there is:
(a)
an increase of the area in good condition for habitat types listed in Annex I until at least 90 % is in good condition and until the favourable reference area for each habitat type in each biogeographic region of the Member State concerned is reached;
(b)
an increasing trend towards the sufficient quality and quantity of the terrestrial, coastal and freshwater habitats of the species listed in Annexes II, IV and V to Directive 92/43/EEC and of the species falling within the scope of Directive 2009/147/EC.
