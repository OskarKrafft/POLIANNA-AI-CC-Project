Article 9
Restoration of the natural connectivity of rivers and natural functions of the related floodplains
1.   Member States shall make an inventory of artificial barriers to the connectivity of surface waters and, taking into account the socio-economic functions of the artificial barriers, identify the barriers that need to be removed to contribute to meeting the restoration targets set out in Article 4 of this Regulation and fulfilling the objective of restoring at least 25 000 km of rivers into free-flowing rivers in the Union by 2030, without prejudice to Directive 2000/60/EC, in particular Article 4(3), (5) and (7) thereof, and Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (46), in particular Article 15 thereof.
2.   Member States shall remove the artificial barriers to the connectivity of surface waters identified in the inventory made pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, in accordance with the plan for their removal referred to in Article 15(3), points (i) and (n). When removing artificial barriers, Member States shall primarily address obsolete barriers, namely those that are no longer needed for renewable energy generation, inland navigation, water supply, flood protection or other uses.
3.   Member States shall complement the removal of artificial barriers in accordance with paragraph 2 by the measures necessary to improve the natural functions of the related floodplains.
4.   Member States shall ensure that the natural connectivity of rivers and natural functions of the related floodplains restored in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 are maintained.
