Article 27
Temporary suspension
1.   If an unforeseeable, exceptional and unprovoked event has occurred that is outside the control of the Union, with severe Union-wide consequences for the availability of land required to secure sufficient agricultural production for Union food consumption, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts which are both necessary and justifiable in an emergency. Such implementing acts may temporarily suspend the application of the relevant provisions of Article 11 to the extent and for such a period as is strictly necessary. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
2.   Implementing acts adopted under paragraph 1 shall remain in force for a period not exceeding 12 months. If after that period the specific problems referred to in paragraph 1 persist, the Commission may submit an appropriate legislative proposal to renew that period.
3.   The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of any act adopted under paragraph 1 within two working days of its adoption.
