Article 7
National defence
1.   When putting in place restoration measures for the purposes of Article 4(1), (4) or (7) or Article 5(1), (2) or (5), Member States may exempt areas used for activities the sole purpose of which is national defence if those measures are deemed to be incompatible with the continued military use of the areas in question.
2.   For the purposes of Article 4(14) and (15) and Article 5(11) and (12), Member States may provide that plans and projects the sole purpose of which is national defence are presumed to be in the overriding public interest.
For the purposes of Article 4(14) and (15) and Article 5(11) and (12), Member States may exempt plans and projects the sole purpose of which is national defence from the requirement that no less damaging alternative solutions are available. However, where a Member State applies that exemption, the Member State shall put in place measures, as far as reasonable and practicable, with the aim to mitigate the impact of those plans and projects on habitat types.
