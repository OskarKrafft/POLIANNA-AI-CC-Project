Article 5
Conditions for re-use
1.   Public sector bodies which are competent under national law to grant or refuse access for the re-use of one or more of the categories of data referred to in Article 3(1) shall make publicly available the conditions for allowing such re-use and the procedure to request the re-use via the single information point referred to in Article 8. Where they grant or refuse access for re-use, they may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 7(1).
Member States shall ensure that public sector bodies are equipped with the necessary resources to comply with this Article.
2.   Conditions for re-use shall be non-discriminatory, transparent, proportionate and objectively justified with regard to the categories of data and the purposes of re-use and the nature of the data for which re-use is allowed. Those conditions shall not be used to restrict competition.
3.   Public sector bodies shall, in accordance with Union and national law, ensure that the protected nature of data is preserved. They may provide for the following requirements:
(a)
to grant access for the re-use of data only where the public sector body or the competent body, following the request for re-use, has ensured that data has been:
(i)
anonymised, in the case of personal data; and
(ii)
modified, aggregated or treated by any other method of disclosure control, in the case of commercially confidential information, including trade secrets or content protected by intellectual property rights;
(b)
to access and re-use the data remotely within a secure processing environment that is provided or controlled by the public sector body;
(c)
to access and re-use the data within the physical premises in which the secure processing environment is located in accordance with high security standards, provided that remote access cannot be allowed without jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties.
4.   In the case of re-use allowed in accordance with paragraph 3, points (b) and (c), the public sector bodies shall impose conditions that preserve the integrity of the functioning of the technical systems of the secure processing environment used. The public sector body shall reserve the right to verify the process, the means and any results of processing of data undertaken by the re-user to preserve the integrity of the protection of the data and reserve the right to prohibit the use of results that contain information jeopardising the rights and interests of third parties. The decision to prohibit the use of the results shall be comprehensible and transparent to the re-user.
5.   Unless national law provides for specific safeguards on applicable confidentiality obligations relating to the re-use of data referred to in Article 3(1), the public sector body shall make the re-use of data provided in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article conditional on the adherence by the re-user to a confidentiality obligation that prohibits the disclosure of any information that jeopardises the rights and interests of third parties that the re-user may have acquired despite the safeguards put in place. Re-users shall be prohibited from re-identifying any data subject to whom the data relates and shall take technical and operational measures to prevent re-identification and to notify any data breach resulting in the re-identification of the data subjects concerned to the public sector body. In the event of the unauthorised re-use of non-personal data, the re-user shall, without delay, where appropriate with the assistance of the public sector body, inform the legal persons whose rights and interests may be affected.
6.   Where the re-use of data cannot be allowed in accordance with the obligations laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article and there is no legal basis for transmitting the data under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the public sector body shall make best efforts, in accordance with Union and national law, to provide assistance to potential re-users in seeking consent of the data subjects or permission from the data holders whose rights and interests may be affected by such re-use, where it is feasible without a disproportionate burden on the public sector body. Where it provides such assistance, the public sector body may be assisted by the competent bodies referred to in Article 7(1).
7.   Re-use of data shall be allowed only in compliance with intellectual property rights. The right of the maker of a database as provided for in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC shall not be exercised by public sector bodies in order to prevent the re-use of data or to restrict re-use beyond the limits set by this Regulation.
8.   Where data requested is considered to be confidential, in accordance with Union or national law on commercial or statistical confidentiality, the public sector bodies shall ensure that the confidential data is not disclosed as a result of allowing re-use, unless such re-use is allowed in accordance with paragraph 6.
9.   Where a re-user intends to transfer non-personal data protected on the grounds set out in Article 3(1) to a third country, it shall inform the public sector body of its intention to transfer such data and the purpose of such transfer at the time of requesting the re-use of such data. In the case of re-use in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article, the re-user shall, where appropriate with the assistance of the public sector body, inform the legal person whose rights and interests may be affected of that intention, purpose and the appropriate safeguards. The public sector body shall not allow the re-use unless the legal person gives permission for the transfer.
10.   Public sector bodies shall transmit non-personal confidential data or data protected by intellectual property rights to a re-user which intends to transfer those data to a third country other than a country designated in accordance with paragraph 12 only if the re-user contractually commits to:
(a)
complying with the obligations imposed in accordance with paragraphs 7 and 8 even after the data is transferred to the third country; and
(b)
accepting the jurisdiction of the courts or tribunals of the Member State of the transmitting public sector body with regard to any dispute related to compliance with paragraphs 7 and 8.
11.   Public sector bodies shall, where relevant and to the extent of their capabilities, provide guidance and assistance to re-users in complying with the obligations referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article.
In order to assist public sector bodies and re-users, the Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing model contractual clauses for complying with the obligations referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 33(3).
12.   Where justified because of the substantial number of requests across the Union concerning the re-use of non-personal data in specific third countries, the Commission may adopt implementing acts declaring that the legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements of a third country:
(a)
ensure protection of intellectual property and trade secrets in a way that is essentially equivalent to the protection ensured under Union law;
(b)
are being effectively applied and enforced; and
(c)
provide effective judicial redress.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 33(3).
13.   Specific Union legislative acts may deem certain non-personal data categories held by public sector bodies to be highly sensitive for the purposes of this Article where their transfer to third countries may put at risk Union public policy objectives, such as safety and public health or may lead to the risk of re-identification of non-personal, anonymised data. Where such an act is adopted, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 32 supplementing this Regulation by laying down special conditions applicable to the transfers of such data to third countries.
Those special conditions shall be based on the nature of the non-personal data categories identified in the specific Union legislative act and on the grounds for deeming those categories to be highly sensitive, taking into account the risks of re-identification of non-personal, anonymised data. They shall be non-discriminatory and limited to what is necessary to achieve the Union public policy objectives identified in that act, in accordance with the Union’s international obligations.
If required by specific Union legislative acts as referred to in the first subparagraph, such special conditions may include terms applicable for the transfer or technical arrangements in this regard, limitations with regard to the re-use of data in third countries or categories of persons entitled to transfer such data to third countries or, in exceptional cases, restrictions with regard to transfers to third countries.
14.   The natural or legal person to which the right to re-use non-personal data was granted may transfer the data only to those third countries for which the requirements in paragraphs 10, 12 and 13 are met.
