Article 19
Registration of recognised data altruism organisations
1.   An entity which meets the requirements of Article 18 may submit an application for registration in the public national register of recognised data altruism organisations in the Member State in which it is established.
2.   An entity which meets the requirements of Article 18 and has establishments in more than one Member State may submit an application for registration in the public national register of recognised data altruism organisations in the Member State in which it has its main establishment.
3.   An entity which meets the requirements of Article 18 but which is not established in the Union shall designate a legal representative in one of the Member States in which the data altruism services are offered.
For the purpose of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, the legal representative shall be mandated by the entity to be addressed in addition to or instead of it by competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations or data subjects and data holders, with regard to all issues related to that entity. The legal representative shall cooperate with and comprehensively demonstrate to the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations, upon request, the actions taken and provisions put in place by the entity to ensure compliance with this Regulation.
The entity shall be deemed to be under the jurisdiction of the Member State in which the legal representative is located. Such an entity may submit an application for registration in the public national register of recognised data altruism organisations in that Member State. The designation of a legal representative by the entity shall be without prejudice to any legal actions which could be initiated against the entity.
4.   Applications for registration referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall contain the following information:
(a)

(b)
the entity’s legal status, form and, where the entity is registered in a public national register, registration number;
(c)
the statutes of the entity, where appropriate;
(d)
the entity’s sources of income;
(e)
the address of the entity’s main establishment in the Union, if any, and, where applicable, any secondary branch in another Member State or that of the legal representative;
(f)

(g)
the entity’s contact persons and contact details;
(h)
the objectives of general interest it intends to promote when collecting data;
(i)
the nature of the data that the entity intends to control or process, and, in the case of personal data, an indication of the categories of personal data;
(j)
any other documents which demonstrate that the requirements of Article 18 are met.
5.   Where the entity has submitted all necessary information pursuant to paragraph 4 and after the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations has evaluated the application for registration and found that the entity complies with the requirements of Article 18, it shall register the entity in the public national register of recognised data altruism organisations within 12 weeks after the receipt of the application for registration. The registration shall be valid in all Member States.
The competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations shall notify the Commission of any registration. The Commission shall include that registration in the public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations.
6.   The information referred to in paragraph 4, points (a), (b), (f), (g) and (h), shall be published in the relevant public national register of recognised data altruism organisations.
7.   A recognised data altruism organisation shall notify the relevant competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations of any changes to the information provided pursuant to paragraph 4 within 14 days of the date of the change.
The competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations shall notify the Commission of each such notification by electronic means without delay. Based on such a notification, the Commission shall update the public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations without delay.
