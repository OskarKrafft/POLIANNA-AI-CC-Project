The single information point shall make available by electronic means a searchable asset list containing an overview of all available data resources including, where relevant, those data resources that are available at sectoral, regional or local information points, with relevant information describing the available data, including at least the data format and size and the conditions for their re-use.
3.   The single information point may establish a separate, simplified and well-documented information channel for SMEs and start-ups, addressing their needs and capabilities in requesting the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3(1).
4.   The Commission shall establish a European single access point offering a searchable electronic register of data available in the national single information points and further information on how to request data via those national single information points.
