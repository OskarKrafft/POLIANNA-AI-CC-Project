5.   Where a data intermediation services provider that is not established in the Union fails to designate a legal representative or the legal representative fails, upon request of the competent authority for data intermediation services, to provide the necessary information that comprehensively demonstrates compliance with this Regulation, the competent authority for data intermediation services shall have the power to postpone the commencement of or to suspend the provision of the data intermediation service until the legal representative is designated or the necessary information is provided.
6.   The competent authorities for data intermediation services shall notify the data intermediation services provider concerned of the measures imposed pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 and the reasons on which they are based, as well as the necessary steps to be taken to rectify the relevant shortcomings, without delay, and shall stipulate a reasonable period, which shall not be longer than 30 days, for the data intermediation services provider to comply with those measures.
7.   If a data intermediation services provider has its main establishment or its legal representative in a Member State but provides services in other Member States, the competent authority for data intermediation services of the Member State of the main establishment or where the legal representative is located and the competent authorities for data intermediation services of those other Member States shall cooperate and assist each other.

The competent authority for data intermediation services shall, upon such a request, provide a response without delay and within a timeframe proportionate to the urgency of the request.
Any information exchanged in the context of assistance requested and provided under this paragraph shall be used only in respect of the matter for which it was requested.
