Article 9
Procedure for requests for re-use
1.   Unless shorter time limits have been established in accordance with national law, the competent public sector bodies or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7(1) shall adopt a decision on the request for the re-use of the categories of data referred to in Article 3(1) within two months of the date of receipt of the request.
In the case of exceptionally extensive and complex requests for re-use, that two-month period may be extended by up to 30 days. In such cases the competent public sector bodies or the competent bodies referred to in Article 7(1) shall notify the applicant as soon as possible that more time is needed for conducting the procedure, together with the reasons for the delay.
2.   Any natural or legal person directly affected by a decision as referred to in paragraph 1 shall have an effective right of redress in the Member State where the relevant body is located. Such a right of redress shall be laid down in national law and shall include the possibility of review by an impartial body with the appropriate expertise, such as the national competition authority, the relevant access-to-documents authority, the supervisory authority established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or a national judicial authority, whose decisions are binding upon the public sector body or the competent body concerned.
