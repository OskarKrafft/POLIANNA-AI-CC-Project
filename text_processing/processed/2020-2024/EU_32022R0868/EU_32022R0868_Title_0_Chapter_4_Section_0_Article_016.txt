Article 16
National arrangements for data altruism
Member States may have in place organisational or technical arrangements, or both, to facilitate data altruism. To that end, Member States may establish national policies for data altruism. Those national policies may, in particular, assist data subjects in making personal data related to them held by public sector bodies available voluntarily for data altruism, and set out the necessary information that is required to be provided to data subjects concerning the re-use of their data in the general interest.
If a Member State develops such national policies, it shall notify the Commission thereof.
