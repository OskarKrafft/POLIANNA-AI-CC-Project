Article 24
Monitoring of compliance
1.   The competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall monitor and supervise compliance of recognised data altruism organisations with the requirements laid down in this Chapter. The competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations may also monitor and supervise the compliance of such recognised data altruism organisations, on the basis of a request by a natural or legal person.
2.   The competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall have the power to request information from recognised data altruism organisations that is necessary to verify compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. Any request for information shall be proportionate to the performance of the task and shall be reasoned.
3.   Where the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations finds that a recognised data altruism organisation does not comply with one or more of the requirements of this Chapter, it shall notify the recognised data altruism organisation of those findings and give it the opportunity to state its views within 30 days of the receipt of the notification.
4.   The competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations shall have the power to require the cessation of the infringement referred to in paragraph 3 either immediately or within a reasonable time limit and shall take appropriate and proportionate measures with the aim of ensuring compliance.
5.   If a recognised data altruism organisation does not comply with one or more of the requirements of this Chapter even after having been notified in accordance with paragraph 3 by the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations, that recognised data altruism organisation shall:
(a)
lose its right to use the label ‘data altruism organisation recognised in the Union’ in any written and spoken communication;
(b)
be removed from the relevant public national register of recognised data altruism organisations and the public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations.
Any decision revoking the right to use the label ‘data altruism organisation recognised in the Union’ under the first subparagraph, point (a), shall be made public by the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations.
6.   If a recognised data altruism organisation has its main establishment or its legal representative in a Member State but is active in other Member States, the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations of the Member State of the main establishment or where the legal representative is located and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations of those other Member States shall cooperate and assist each other. Such assistance and cooperation may cover information exchanges between the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations concerned for the purposes of their tasks under this Regulation and reasoned requests to take the measures referred to in this Article.
Where a competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations in one Member State requests assistance from a competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations in another Member State, it shall submit a reasoned request. The competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations shall, upon such a request, provide a response without delay and within a timeframe proportionate to the urgency of the request.
Any information exchanged in the context of assistance requested and provided under this paragraph shall be used only in respect of the matter for which it was requested.
