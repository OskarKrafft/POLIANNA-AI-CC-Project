Article 17
Public registers of recognised data altruism organisations
1.   Each competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations shall keep and regularly update a public national register of recognised data altruism organisations.
2.   The Commission shall maintain a public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations for information purposes. Provided that an entity is registered in the public national register of recognised data altruism organisations in accordance with Article 18, it may use the label ‘data altruism organisation recognised in the Union’ in its written and spoken communication, as well as a common logo.
In order to ensure that recognised data altruism organisations are easily identifiable throughout the Union, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish a design for the common logo. Recognised data altruism organisations shall display the common logo clearly on every online and offline publication that relates to their data altruism activities. The common logo shall be accompanied by a QR code with a link to the public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
