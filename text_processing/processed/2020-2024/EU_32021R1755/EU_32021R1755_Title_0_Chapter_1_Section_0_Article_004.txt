Geographical coverage and resources of the Reserve
1.   All Member States shall be eligible for support from the Reserve.
2.   The maximum resources of the Reserve shall be EUR 5 470 435 000 in current prices.
3.   The resources referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be provisionally allocated, in both commitment and payment appropriations, pursuant to the methodology set out in Annex I. They shall be made available as follows:
(a)
a pre-financing amount of EUR 4 321 749 000 in current prices shall be made available and paid in three instalments of EUR 1 697 933 000 in 2021, EUR 1 298 919 000 in 2022 and EUR 1 324 897 000 in 2023 in accordance with Article 9;
(b)
a remaining provisionally allocated amount of EUR 1 148 686 000 in current prices shall be made available in 2025 in accordance with Article 12.
The amounts referred to in the first subparagraph, point (a), of this paragraph shall be considered pre-financing within the meaning of Article 115(2), point (b)(i), of the Financial Regulation.
4.   Member States whose provisional allocation from the resources of the Reserve includes an amount exceeding EUR 10 million determined on the basis of the factor linked to fish caught in the United Kingdom’s exclusive economic zone shall spend at least 50 % of that amount or 7 % of their provisionally allocated amount, whichever is lower, to support local and regional coastal communities, including the fisheries sector, in particular the small-scale coastal fisheries sector dependent on fishing activities.
Where the provisional allocation is not entirely used, the amounts required to be spent for the purpose referred to in the first subparagraph shall be proportionately reduced.
Where the amount required to be spent to support local and regional coastal communities is not entirely used for that purpose, 50 % of the amount unused shall be deducted in the calculation of the total accepted amount.
The amount of eligible expenditure accepted, as referred to in Article 12(2), point (a), shall specify, where applicable, the accepted amount of expenditure to support local and regional coastal communities.
The application for a financial contribution from the Reserve shall include a breakdown of the expenditure incurred and paid for measures supporting local and regional coastal communities, in accordance with Annex II.
5.   The Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, set out the provisional amounts allocated to each Member State based on the criteria set out in Annex I. That implementing act shall also set out the minimum amount of resources that shall be spent in accordance with paragraph 4.
