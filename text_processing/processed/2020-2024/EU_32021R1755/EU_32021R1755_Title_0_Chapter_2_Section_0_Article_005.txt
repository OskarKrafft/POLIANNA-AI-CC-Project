3.   When designing support measures, Member States shall take into account the varied impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union on different regions and local communities and focus financial contribution from the Reserve on those most adversely affected by the withdrawal, while taking into account the partnership principle and encouraging a multi-level dialogue with local and regional authorities and communities of regions and sectors that are most adversely affected by the withdrawal, social partners and civil society, where relevant, and in accordance with their institutional, legal and financial framework.
4.   When designing support measures in the field of fisheries, Member States shall take into account the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, making sure that those measures contribute to the sustainable management of fish stocks and shall endeavour to support fishers most adversely affected by the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union, including small-scale coastal fisheries.
5.   The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with applicable law.
6.   Measures eligible under paragraph 1 may receive support from other Union funds and programmes provided that such support does not cover the same cost.
7.   Member States shall repay the contribution from the Reserve to an action comprising investment in infrastructure or productive investment, if within 5 years of the final payment to the recipients of the financial contribution from the Reserve or within the period of time set out in State aid rules, where applicable, that action is subject to any of the following:
(a)
a cessation of a productive activity or a transfer of a productive activity outside the Member State in which it received financial contribution from the Reserve;
(b)
a change in ownership of an item of infrastructure which gives to a firm or a public body an undue advantage;
(c)
a substantial change affecting its nature, objectives or implementation conditions which would result in undermining its original objectives.
Member States may reduce the time limit set out in the first subparagraph to 3 years in cases that concern the maintenance of investments or jobs created by SMEs.
This paragraph shall not apply to any action that undergoes cessation of a productive activity due to a non-fraudulent bankruptcy.
