Article 8
Database of forced labour risk areas or products
1.   The Commission shall establish a database, with the assistance of external expertise if needed. This database shall provide indicative, non-exhaustive, evidence-based, verifiable and regularly updated information on forced labour risks in specific geographic areas or with respect to specific products or product groups, including with regard to forced labour imposed by state authorities. The database shall prioritise the identification of widespread and severe forced labour risks.
2.   The database referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on independent and verifiable information from international organisations, in particular the ILO and the UN, or institutional, research or academic organisations.
The database shall not publicly disclose information that names economic operators directly.
The database shall indicate specific economic sectors in specific geographic areas for which there is reliable and verifiable evidence that forced labour imposed by state authorities exists.
3.   The Commission shall ensure that the database is easily accessible, including for persons with disabilities, and made publicly available, in all official languages of the institutions of the Union, by 14 June 2026.
