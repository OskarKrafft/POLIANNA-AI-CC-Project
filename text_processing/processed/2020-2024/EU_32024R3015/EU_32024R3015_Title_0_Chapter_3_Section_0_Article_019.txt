Article 19
Field inspections
1.   In exceptional situations where the lead competent authority deems it necessary to conduct field inspections, it shall do so taking into consideration where the risk of forced labour is located.
2.   Where the risk of forced labour is located in the territory of the Member State, the lead competent authority may conduct its own inspections, in accordance with national law in compliance with Union law. If necessary, the lead competent authority may request cooperation from other national authorities relevant for the implementation of this Regulation, such as labour, health or fiscal authorities.
3.   Where the risk of forced labour is located outside the territory of the Union, the Commission acting as lead competent authority may carry out all necessary checks and inspections provided that the economic operators concerned give their consent and that the government of the third country in which the inspections are to take place has been officially notified and raises no objection. The Commission may request assistance from the European External Action Service, as appropriate, to facilitate such contacts.
