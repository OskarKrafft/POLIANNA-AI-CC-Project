Article 10
Support measures for SMEs
The Commission shall develop accompanying measures to support the efforts of economic operators and their business partners in the same supply chain, in particular SMEs. Where appropriate, information on those measures shall be made available through the Forced Labour Single Portal referred to in Article 12.
Competent authorities shall designate contact points to provide information to SMEs regarding matters related to the application of this Regulation. Those contact points may also provide assistance to SMEs on those matters.
Member States’ competent authorities may also organise training sessions for economic operators on forced labour risk indicators and on how to engage in dialogue with those competent authorities throughout an investigation.
