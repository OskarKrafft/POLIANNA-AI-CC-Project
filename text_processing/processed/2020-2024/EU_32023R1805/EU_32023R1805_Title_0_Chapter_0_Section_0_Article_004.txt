1.   The yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship during a reporting period shall not exceed the limit set out in paragraph 2.
2.   The limit referred to in paragraph 1 shall be calculated by reducing the reference value of 91,16 grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ by the following percentage:

4.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 28 to amend Annex II in order to include the well-to-wake emission factors related to any new sources of energy or to adapt the existing emission factors to ensure consistency with future international standards or Union legal acts in the field of energy, in accordance with the best available scientific and technical knowledge.
