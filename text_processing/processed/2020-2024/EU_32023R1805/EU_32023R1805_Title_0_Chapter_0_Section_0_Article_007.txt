Article 7
Common principles for monitoring and reporting
1.   In accordance with Articles 8, 9 and 10, companies shall, for each of their ships, monitor and report on the relevant data during a reporting period. They shall carry out that monitoring and reporting within all ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State and for any voyages referred to in Article 2(1).
2.   Monitoring and reporting shall be complete and cover the energy used on board by ships at any time, whether at sea or at berth. Companies shall apply appropriate measures to prevent any data gaps within the reporting period.
3.   Monitoring and reporting shall be consistent and comparable over time. To that end, companies shall use the same monitoring methodologies and data sets subject to modifications assessed by the verifier. Companies shall enable reasonable assurance of the integrity of the data to be monitored and reported.
4.   Companies shall obtain, analyse and store, for at least five years, all monitoring data and documentation, including assumptions, references, emission factors, fuel bunker delivery notes as complemented in accordance with Annex I and activity data, and any other information needed to verify compliance with this Regulation, in a transparent and accurate manner, in paper or electronic form, so that the verifier is able to determine the GHG intensity of the energy used on board by ships.
5.   In undertaking the monitoring and reporting activities set out in Articles 8, 9, 10 and 15 of this Regulation, information and data collected for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2015/757 shall be used where appropriate.
