Article 11
Assessment of the monitoring plan and of the modified monitoring plan
1.   For each ship and in the event of a change of verifier, the verifier shall assess the conformity of the monitoring plan with the requirements set out in Articles 7, 8 and 9. Where the verifier’s assessment identifies non-conformities with those requirements, the company concerned shall without undue delay revise its monitoring plan accordingly and submit the revised plan for a final assessment by the verifier before the reporting period starts. The company concerned shall agree with the verifier on the time-frame necessary to introduce those revisions. That timeframe shall in any event not extend beyond the beginning of the reporting period.
2.   Modifications to the monitoring plan under Article 9(2), points (b), (c) and (d), shall be subject to an assessment by the verifier. Following that assessment, the verifier shall notify the company concerned whether those modifications are in conformity with the requirements set out in Articles 7, 8 and 9.
3.   Once the monitoring plan and the modified monitoring plan have been satisfactorily assessed, the verifier shall record them in the FuelEU database. The monitoring plan and the modified monitoring plan shall be accessible to the administering State.
