ArticleÂ 1
Subject matter and objective
This Regulation lays down uniform rules imposing:
(a)
a limit on the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of energy used on board by a ship arriving at, staying within or departing from ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State; and
(b)
an obligation to use on-shore power supply (OPS) or zero-emission technology in ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State.
Its objective in doing so is to increase consistent use of renewable and low-carbon fuels and substitute sources of energy in maritime transport across the Union, in line with the objective of reaching Union-wide climate neutrality at the latest by 2050, while ensuring the smooth operation of maritime transport, creating regulatory certainty for the uptake of renewable and low-carbon fuels and sustainable technologies and avoiding distortions in the internal market.
