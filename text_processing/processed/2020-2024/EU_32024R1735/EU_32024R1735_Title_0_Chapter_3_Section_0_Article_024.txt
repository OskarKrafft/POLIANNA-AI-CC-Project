Article 24
Regulatory framework for the market for captured CO2

1.   By 30 June 2027, the Commission shall carry out an assessment of the functioning of the market for captured CO2. That assessment shall be based on a clear methodology, take into account the annual reports referred to in Article 21(2) and, in particular, consider whether:
(a)
the obligations set out in Article 23(1) effectively promote the development of the CO2 storage market in the Union;
(b)
the market provides for open, fair and non-discriminatory access and safety of the CO2 storage and transport network;
(c)
the market provides for open, fair and non-discriminatory access to capture CO2 for usage or storage purposes;
(d)
the adequacy of the CO2 transport network and other infrastructure across the Union to sufficiently support the injection capacity objectives as well as the need for CO2 capture;
(e)
the functioning of the CO2 market ensures sufficient access to injection capacity for hard-to-abate CO2 emissions.
2.   On the basis of the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may propose a legislative act to regulate the market in order to address any shortcomings identified, in particular with regard to hard-to-abate emissions.
