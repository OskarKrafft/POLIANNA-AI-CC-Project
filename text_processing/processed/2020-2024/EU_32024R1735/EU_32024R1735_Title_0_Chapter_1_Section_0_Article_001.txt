Article 1
Subject matter
1.   The general objective of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by establishing a framework in order to ensure the Union’s access to a secure and sustainable supply of net-zero technologies, including by scaling up the manufacturing capacity of net-zero technologies and their supply chains to safeguard their resilience while contributing to achieving the Union’s climate targets and climate neutrality objective, as defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, with a view to the decarbonisation of the Union’s economy and society, and by contributing to quality jobs in net-zero technologies, and thereby also improving the competitiveness of the Union.
2.   To achieve the general objective referred to in paragraph 1, this Regulation lays down measures aiming to:
(a)
lower the risk of supply disruptions related to net-zero technologies likely to distort competition and fragment the internal market, in particular by identifying and supporting the scale-up of the manufacturing capacity of net-zero technologies and their supply chains;
(b)
establish a Union market for CO2 storage services;
(c)
encourage demand for sustainable and resilient net-zero technologies through public procurement procedures, auctioning and other forms of public intervention;
(d)
enhance skills through the support of the Academies, thereby safeguarding and creating quality jobs;
(e)
support innovation through the creation of net-zero regulatory sandboxes, coordination of research and innovation activities through the Strategic Energy Technologies Plan Steering Group, as well as through the use of pre-commercial procurement and public procurement of innovative solutions;
(f)
improve the Union’s ability to monitor and mitigate supply risks related to net-zero technologies.
