Article 17
Net-zero Acceleration Valleys
1.   Member States may decide to designate net-zero Acceleration Valleys (the ‘Valleys’) as specific areas to accelerate net-zero industrial activities, in particular to accelerate the implementation of net-zero technology manufacturing projects, including net-zero strategic projects or clusters thereof, or to test innovative net-zero technologies. The objectives of the Valleys shall be to create clusters of net-zero industrial activity and to further streamline administrative procedures.
2.   The decision referred to in paragraph 1 shall:
(a)
define a clear geographic and technology scope for the Valleys;
(b)
take into account areas that include artificial and built surfaces, industrial sites, and brownfield sites;
(c)
be subject to an environmental assessment pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC, and, where applicable, to an assessment pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC; to the extent possible, the results of those assessments shall facilitate the preparation of net-zero technology manufacturing projects or net-zero strategic projects with a view to meeting the objectives of this Regulation and avoiding duplication of assessments; this provision is without prejudice to the compliance of individual projects with applicable Union environmental law;
(d)
ensure synergies, where possible, with the designation of renewables acceleration areas as established by Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council (54).
3.   A decision by a Member State to designate a Valley shall be accompanied by a plan setting out concrete national measures to increase its attractiveness as a location for manufacturing activities, including at least the following economic and administrative support schemes to:
(a)
facilitate the development of the necessary infrastructure in the Valley;
(b)
support private investments in the Valley;
(c)
achieve the adequate reskilling and upskilling of the local workforce;
(d)
make information about the Valley accessible online in accordance with Article 7.
4.   Public investments with the aim of setting up Valleys, equipping them with appropriate infrastructure, converting brownfield sites and developing the adequacy of the local skills pool may benefit, where appropriate, from the maximum co-financing rates under Regulations (EU) 2021/1058, (EU) 2021/1056 and (EU) 2021/1057.
