Article 21
Transparency of CO2 storage capacity data
1.   By 30 December 2024, Member States shall:
(a)
make data on all areas where CO2 storage sites could be permitted on their territory, including saline aquifers, publicly available, without prejudice to requirements regarding the protection of confidential information;
(b)
oblige entities which are or have been holders of an authorisation as defined in Article 1, point 3, of Directive 94/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (55) on their territory to make publicly available on a non-reliance basis geological data relating to production sites that have been decommissioned or whose decommissioning has been notified to the competent authority and, if available, economic assessments of the respective costs of enabling CO2 injection, unless the entity has applied for an exploration permit in accordance with Directive 2009/31/EC, including data on:
(i)
whether the site is suitable for sustainably, safely and permanently injecting and storing CO2;
(ii)
the availability or need for transport infrastructure and modes suitable for safely transporting CO2 to reach the site.
For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the data shall include at least the information requested in the Commission Notices on the Guidance to Member States for integrated national energy and climate plans notified pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and the updates thereof submitted pursuant to Article 14 thereof (national energy and climate plans).
2.   By 30 December 2024 and each year thereafter, each Member State shall submit to the Commission a report, which shall be made publicly available, and shall be without prejudice to requirements regarding the protection of confidential information, describing:
(a)
a mapping of CO2 capture projects in progress on its territory or in cooperation with other Member States, and an estimation of the corresponding needs for injection and storage capacities, and CO2 transport;
(b)
a mapping of CO2 storage and CO2 transport projects in progress on its territory, including the status of permitting under Directive 2009/31/EC, expected dates for Final Investment Decision (FID) and entry into operation;
(c)
the national support measures that have been or will be adopted to prompt projects referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph, as well as measures relating to the cross-border transport of CO2;

(d)
the national strategy and targets that will be and have been set for the capture of CO2 by 2030, where applicable;
(e)
bilateral and regional cooperation that facilitates the cross-border transport of CO2, including their implications for the access of entities capturing CO2 to a safe and non- discriminatory means of transporting CO2;
(f)
CO2 transport projects in progress and an estimation of the necessary future CO2 transport projects’ capacity to match the corresponding capture and storage capacity.
3.   Should the report referred to in paragraph 2 show that no CO2 storage projects are in progress on their territory, Member States shall report on plans to facilitate the decarbonisation of industrial sectors. This shall, if applicable, include the cross-border transport of CO2 to storage sites located in other Member States as well as CO2 utilisation projects.
