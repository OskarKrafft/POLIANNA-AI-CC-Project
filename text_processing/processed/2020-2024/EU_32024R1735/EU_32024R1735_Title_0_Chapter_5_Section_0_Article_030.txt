Article 30
European net-zero industry academies
1.   Based on an assessment, by the Commission, using existing data and reports, of skills shortages in net-zero technology industries key for the industrial transformation and decarbonisation, and fully respecting the competence of Member States in the field of education and training, the Commission shall support, including through the provision of seed-funding, the launch of European net-zero industry academies (the ‘Academies’), as organisations or consortia or projects of relevant stakeholders, which have the following objectives:
(a)
developing, for voluntary use by Member States and education and training providers on their territories, learning programmes, content and learning and training materials for training and education, such as on developing, producing, installing, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, ecodesigning, re-using and recycling net-zero technologies, and on raw materials as well as relevant occupational health and safety aspects and transversal competences; this shall reflect the assessment of skills shortages and support the capacities of public authorities, in particular those competent to issue permits and authorisations referred to in Chapter II and contracting authorities and contracting entities referred to in Chapter IV of this Regulation;
(b)
promoting the voluntary use of the learning programmes, content and materials by education and training providers in the Member States;
(c)
offering support to the education and training providers that use the learning programmes, content and materials produced by the Academies to uphold the quality of the training offered and to develop mechanisms to ensure the quality of the training offered;
(d)
developing credentials, including, if appropriate, micro-credentials, for voluntary use by Member States and education and training providers on their territories, in order to facilitate the identification of skills and, where appropriate, the recognition of qualifications, to enhance the transferability between jobs and industries, to facilitate the cross-border mobility of the workforce, to promote matching with relevant quality jobs through tools such as the European network of employment services (EURES) and EURAXESS, and to ensure visibility of the fact that a learning programme or learning content was developed by an Academy.
2.   The Academies shall involve relevant actors, such as net-zero technology industry, education and training providers and social partners from a range of Member States. The Academies shall develop action plans setting out, among others, milestones, targets including in terms of number of learners to be based on the assessment of skills shortages, as well as a financial plan aiming to achieve financial sustainability. Those action plans shall pay particular attention to regions in industrial transformation or with a high rate of unemployment, where relevant.
3.   The Academies shall produce gender-balanced content, contribute to counter gender stereotypes and promote equal access to learning contents for all, paying particular attention to the need to activate more women and young people, in particular NEETs, older people, workers in professions which are at risk of disappearing or the content and tasks of which are being highly transformed by new technologies, people working in regions in transition and persons with disabilities. The Academies shall promote diversity and the inclusivity of people with disability, migrants and people in vulnerable situations.
4.   Without prejudice to the respective powers of the budgetary authority, financial means shall be made available where appropriate at Union level to support the launch of the Academies with seed-funding as referred to in paragraph 1. In addition, Member States are encouraged to make use of relevant Union funds such as ESF+, to support the deployment of the learning content developed by the Academies.
