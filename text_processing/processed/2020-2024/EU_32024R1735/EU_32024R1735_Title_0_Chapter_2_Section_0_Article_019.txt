Article 19
Coordination of financing
1.   The Platform as established in Article 38 shall examine the bottlenecks and Union-wide financial needs of net-zero strategic projects, advise on ways of coordinating Union and national financing with regard to those financial needs, and collect potential best practices, inter alia, for the purpose of developing Union cross-border supply chains, in particular on the basis of regular exchanges and recommendations of the net-zero Industry Group and with the relevant industrial alliances.
2.   The Platform shall, at the request of the net-zero strategic project promoter, discuss and advise on how the financing of the project can be completed, taking into account the funding already secured and considering at least the following elements:
(a)
additional private sources of financing;
(b)
support through resources from the EIB Group or other international financial institutions including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development;
(c)
existing Member State instruments and programmes, including from national promotional banks, institutions and Export Credit Agencies;
(d)
relevant Union funding and financing programmes.
3.   By 30 September 2024 and every two years thereafter, the Platform shall provide recommendations to the Commission on ways to ensure sufficient funding, including through the Union budget, to pursue the objectives of this Regulation.
4.   Member States and, where appropriate, the Commission shall undertake activities to accelerate public investments in net-zero technology manufacturing projects. Such activities may, without prejudice to Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, include advising on and coordinating support for net-zero technology manufacturing projects which are facing difficulties in accessing finance.
