Article 31
Regulated professions in the net-zero technology industries and recognition of professional qualifications
1.   Within nine months after the completion of the learning content and materials developed by an Academy and every two years thereafter, Member States shall strive to identify whether the learning programmes developed by that Academy are equivalent to the specific qualifications required by the host Member State to access regulated activities within the scope of a profession with particular interest for the net-zero technology industry in that Member State. Member States shall ensure that the results of the assessments are made public and easily accessible online. In the event that the learning programmes are deemed not to be equivalent to the qualifications required by the host Member State to access regulated activities, or where a Member State has not sought to identify equivalence, that Member State shall inform the Platform, providing relevant information on:
(a)
the reasoning for not completing the identification exercise; or
(b)
the differences between the learning programmes developed by the Academies and the specific qualifications required by that host Member State, and how to achieve equivalence.
2.   If a Member State concludes that the learning programmes developed by an Academy are equivalent to the specific qualifications required by the host Member State to access regulated activities, it shall facilitate the recognition of credentials issued by education and training providers on the basis of the learning programmes developed by the Academy, under Title III, Chapter I of Directive 2005/36/EC, where a holder of such a credential requests access to a regulated profession within the meaning of Article 3(1), point (a), of Directive 2005/36/EC, and of particular importance for the net-zero technology industry, by treating the credential as sufficient evidence of formal qualifications, in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 2005/36/EC.
3.   Where access to a profession of particular importance for the net-zero technology industry is regulated within the meaning of Article 3(1), point (a), of Directive 2005/36/EC, Member States shall work towards developing a common set of minimum knowledge, skills and competences necessary for the pursuit of that specific profession for the purpose of establishing a common training framework as referred to in Article 49a(1) of Directive 2005/36/EC to enable automatic recognition of qualifications. The Platform may also submit suggestions for common training frameworks, as referred to in Article 49a(3) of Directive 2005/36/EC.
