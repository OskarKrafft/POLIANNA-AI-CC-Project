Article 11
Planning
1.   National, regional and local authorities responsible for preparing plans, including zoning, spatial plans and land use plans, shall consider including in such plans, where appropriate, provisions for the development of net-zero technology manufacturing projects, including net-zero strategic projects and, where appropriate, net-zero industry acceleration valleys, as well as the necessary infrastructure. Where considering to include such provisions, priority shall be given to artificial and built surfaces, industrial sites and brownfield sites. To facilitate the development of net-zero technology manufacturing projects, Member States shall ensure that all relevant spatial planning data is available online in accordance with Article 7.
2.   Where plans include provisions for the development of net-zero technology manufacturing projects, including net-zero strategic projects, and their required infrastructure, and are subject to an assessment pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC and pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC, those assessments shall be combined. Where applicable, the combined assessment shall also address the impact on potentially affected water bodies referred to in Directive 2000/60/EC. Where relevant Member States are required to assess the impacts of existing and future activities on the marine environment, including land-sea interactions, as referred to in Article 4 of Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (53), those impacts shall also be covered in the combined assessment. The fact that assessments are combined pursuant to this paragraph shall not affect their content or quality. The combined assessment shall be carried out in a manner that does not lead to a prolongation of the time limits set out in this Regulation.
