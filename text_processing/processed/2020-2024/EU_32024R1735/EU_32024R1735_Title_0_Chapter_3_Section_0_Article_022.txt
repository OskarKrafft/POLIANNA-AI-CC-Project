Article 22
CO2 transport infrastructure
1.   In order to facilitate the achievement of the objective set out in Article 20, the Union and its Member States, where appropriate in collaboration with relevant companies, shall make all reasonable efforts to develop the necessary CO2 transport infrastructure, including cross-border infrastructure, while taking into account the economic and environmental benefits of proximity of capture and storage sites.
2.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable access to CO2 transport networks and to storage sites for the purposes of geological storage of the produced and captured CO2 as far as it is economically feasible to do so or when a potential customer is willing to pay, in accordance with Article 21 of Directive 2009/31/EC.
3.   Where CO2 is captured and transported in one Member State and transported and stored in other Member States, Member States shall coordinate the measures taken by them pursuant to paragraph 2. The Commission may facilitate such coordination through the establishment of CCS Regional Groupings when there is a joint request from the Member States involved.
