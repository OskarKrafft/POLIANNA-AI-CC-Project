Reduction of monthly and interim payments
1.   Where the Commission establishes from declarations of expenditure or the information, declarations and documents referred to in Article 90 that financial ceilings set by Union law have been exceeded, the Commission shall reduce the monthly or interim payments to the Member State concerned in the framework of the implementing acts concerning the monthly payments referred to in Article 21(3) or in the framework of the interim payments referred to in Article 32.
