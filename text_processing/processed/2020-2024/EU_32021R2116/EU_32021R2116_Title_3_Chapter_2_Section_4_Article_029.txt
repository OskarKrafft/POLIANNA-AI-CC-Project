Article 29
Budgetary commitments
1.   The Commission’s implementing decision approving a CAP Strategic Plan shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 110(1) of the Financial Regulation and, once notified to the Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation. That implementing decision shall specify the contribution per year.
2.   The Union’s budgetary commitments in respect of each CAP Strategic Plan shall be made in annual instalments between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2027. By way of derogation from Article 111(2) of the Financial Regulation, for each CAP Strategic Plan, the budgetary commitments for the first instalment shall be made after the Commission approves that CAP Strategic Plan and notifies the Member State concerned thereof. The budgetary commitments for subsequent instalments shall be made by the Commission before 1 May of each year, on the basis of the implementing decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, except where Article 16 of the Financial Regulation applies.
