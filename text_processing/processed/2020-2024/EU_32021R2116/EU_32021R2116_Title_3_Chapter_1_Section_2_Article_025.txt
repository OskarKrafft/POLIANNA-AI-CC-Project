1.   The actions financed pursuant to Article 7, point (c), shall aim to give the Commission the means to:
(a)
manage Union agricultural markets in a global context;
(b)
ensure agri-economic and agri-environmental-climate monitoring of agricultural land use and agricultural land use change, including agro-forestry, and monitoring of the condition of soil, crops, agricultural landscapes and agricultural land so as to enable estimates to be made, in particular as regards yields and agricultural production and agricultural impacts associated with exceptional circumstances, and to enable the assessment of the resilience of agricultural systems and progress towards the achievement of the relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals;
(c)
share the access to the estimates referred to in point (b) in an international context, such as the initiatives coordinated by United Nations organisations, including the constitution of greenhouse gas inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or other international agencies;

contribute to specific measures increasing the transparency of world markets, taking account of Union objectives and commitments;
(e)
ensure technological follow-up of the agri-meteorological system.

(a)
the collection or purchase of data needed to implement and monitor the CAP, including satellite data, geo-spatial data and meteorological data;
(b)
the creation of a spatial data infrastructure and a website;
(c)
the carrying out of specific studies on climatic conditions;
(d)
remote sensing used to assist in the monitoring of agricultural land use change and soil health; and

the updating of agri-meteorological and econometric models.
Where necessary, those actions shall be carried out in collaboration with the European Environment Agency, the Joint Research Centre, national laboratories and bodies or with the involvement of the private sector.
