Article 19
Early-warning and monitoring system
In order to ensure that the budget ceiling referred to in Article 14 is not exceeded, the Commission shall implement a monthly early-warning and monitoring system in respect of EAGF expenditure.
To that end, at the beginning of each budgetary year, the Commission shall determine monthly expenditure profiles based, where appropriate, on average monthly expenditure during the previous three years.
The Commission shall periodically submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council in which the development of expenditure effected in relation to the profiles is examined and which contains an assessment of the forecasted implementation for the current budgetary year.
