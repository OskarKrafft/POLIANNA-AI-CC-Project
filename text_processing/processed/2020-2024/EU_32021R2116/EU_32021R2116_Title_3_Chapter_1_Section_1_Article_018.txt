Article 18
Budgetary discipline procedure
1.   Where, upon drawing up the draft budget for budgetary year N, there appears to be a risk that the amount referred to in Article 14 of this Regulation for budgetary year N will be exceeded, the Commission shall propose the measures necessary to ensure compliance with that amount. Those measures are to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council where the legal basis of the relevant measure is Article 43(2) TFEU or by the Council where the legal basis of the relevant measure is Article 43(3) TFEU.
2.   If at any time the Commission considers that there is a risk that the amount referred to in Article 14 of this Regulation will be exceeded and that it cannot take adequate measures to remedy the situation, it shall propose other measures to ensure compliance with that amount. Those measures are to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council where the legal basis of the relevant measure is Article 43(2) TFEU or by the Council where the legal basis of the relevant measure is Article 43(3) TFEU.
3.   Where, at the end of budgetary year N, reimbursement requests from the Member States exceed or are likely to exceed the amount referred to in Article 14, the Commission shall:
(a)
consider the requests submitted by Member States pro rata subject to the budget available, and adopt implementing acts setting provisionally the amount of the payments for the month concerned;
(b)
determine for all Member States, on or before 28 February of budgetary year N + 1, their situation with regard to Union financing for the budgetary year N;
(c)
adopt implementing acts setting the total amount of Union financing broken down by Member State, on the basis of a single rate of Union financing, subject to the amount which was available for the monthly payments;
(d)
effect, at the latest when the monthly payments are made for March of budgetary year N + 1, any compensation to be carried out with respect to Member States.
The implementing acts provided for in the first subparagraph, points (a) and (c), of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 103(2).
