Article 77
Scrutiny by Member States
1.   Member States shall carry out systematic scrutiny of the commercial documents of undertakings taking account of the nature of the transactions to be scrutinised. Member States shall ensure that the selection of undertakings for scrutiny gives the best possible assurance of the effectiveness of the measures for preventing and detecting irregularities. The selection shall take account, inter alia, of the financial importance of the undertakings in that system and of other risk factors.
2.   In appropriate cases, the scrutiny provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be extended to natural and legal persons with whom undertakings are associated and to such other natural or legal persons as may be relevant for the pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 78.
3.   The body or bodies responsible for the application of this Chapter shall be organised in such a way as to be independent of the departments or branches of departments responsible for the payments and the checks carried out prior to payment.
4.   Undertakings for which the sum of the receipts or payments amounted to less than EUR 40 000 shall be scrutinised in accordance with this Chapter only for specific reasons to be indicated by the Member States in their annual control plan referred to in Article 80(1).
5.   The scrutiny carried out pursuant to this Chapter shall not prejudice the checks undertaken pursuant to Articles 49 and 50.
