Article 68
Identification system for agricultural parcels
1.   The identification system for agricultural parcels shall be a geographic information system established and regularly updated by the Member States on the basis of aerial or spatial ortho-imagery, with a uniform standard that guarantees a level of accuracy that is at least equivalent to that of cartography at a scale of 1:5 000.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the identification system for agricultural parcels:
(a)
uniquely identifies each agricultural parcel and units of land containing non-agricultural areas considered eligible by the Member States for receiving the aid for the interventions referred to in Title III of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115;
(b)
contains up-to-date values on the areas considered eligible by the Member States for receiving the aid for the interventions referred to in Article 65(2);
(c)
enables the correct localisation of agricultural parcels and non-agricultural areas claimed for payment.
3.   Member States shall annually assess the quality of the identification system for agricultural parcels in accordance with the methodology set up at Union level.
Where the assessment reveals deficiencies in the system, Member States shall adopt appropriate remedial actions or, failing that, shall be requested by the Commission to set up an action plan in accordance with Article 42.
An assessment report and, where appropriate, the remedial actions and the timetable for their implementation shall be submitted to the Commission by 15 February following the calendar year concerned.
