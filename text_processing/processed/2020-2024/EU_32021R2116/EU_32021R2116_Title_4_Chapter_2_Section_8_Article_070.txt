Article 70
Area monitoring system
1.   Member States shall set up and operate an area monitoring system, which shall be operational from 1 January 2023. If the full deployment of the system from that date is not feasible due to technical limitations, Member States may choose to set up and start the operation of such a system gradually, providing information for a limited number of interventions only. However, by 1 January 2024, an area monitoring system in all Member States shall be fully operational.
2.   Member States shall annually assess the quality of the area monitoring system in accordance with the methodology set up at Union level.
Where the assessment reveals deficiencies in the system, Member States shall adopt appropriate remedial actions or, failing that, shall be requested by the Commission to set up an action plan in accordance with Article 42.
An assessment report and, where appropriate, the remedial actions and the timetable for their implementation shall be submitted to the Commission by 15 February following the calendar year concerned.
