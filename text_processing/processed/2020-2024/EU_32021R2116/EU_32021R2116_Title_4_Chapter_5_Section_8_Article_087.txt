Article 87
Control system for social conditionality
1.   Member States shall set up a system providing for the application of administrative penalties to beneficiaries referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 who do not comply with the rules on social conditionality listed in Annex IV to that Regulation.
To that end, Member States shall make use of their applicable control and enforcement systems in the field of social and employment legislation and applicable labour standards to ensure that beneficiaries of the aid referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115, in Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 or in Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) No 229/2013 comply with the obligations referred to in Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2021/2115.
2.   Member States shall ensure a clear separation of responsibilities between the authorities or bodies responsible for the enforcement of social and employment legislation and applicable labour standards on the one hand, and the paying agencies on the other, the role of the paying agencies being the execution of payments and the application of penalties under the social conditionality mechanism.
