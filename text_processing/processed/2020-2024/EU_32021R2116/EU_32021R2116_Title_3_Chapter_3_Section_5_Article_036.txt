Article 36
No double funding
Member States shall ensure that expenditure financed under the EAGF or the EAFRD is not the subject of any other financing from the Union budget.
Under the EAFRD, an operation may receive different forms of support from the CAP Strategic Plan and from the other funds referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 or from other Union instruments only if the total cumulated aid amount granted under the different forms of support does not exceed the highest aid intensity or aid amount applicable to that type of intervention as referred to in Title III of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115. In such cases Member States shall not declare the same expenditure to the Commission for support:
(a)
from another fund referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 or from another Union instrument; or
(b)
from the same CAP Strategic Plan.
The amount of expenditure to be entered into a declaration of expenditure may be calculated on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the document setting out the conditions for support.
