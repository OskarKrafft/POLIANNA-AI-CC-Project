Article 57
Provisions specific to the EAFRD
1.   Where irregularities and other cases of non-compliance by beneficiaries, and as regards financial instruments, also by specific funds under holding funds or final recipients, with the conditions of the interventions for rural development specified in the CAP Strategic Plans are detected, Member States shall make financial adjustments by cancelling partially or, when justified, entirely the Union financing concerned. Member States shall take into consideration the nature and gravity of the non-compliance detected and the level of the financial loss to the EAFRD.
Amounts of the Union financing under the EAFRD which are cancelled and amounts recovered, and the interest thereon, shall be reallocated to other rural development operations in the CAP Strategic Plans. However, Member States may reuse the cancelled or recovered Union funds in their entirety only for a rural development operation under their CAP Strategic Plans and may not reallocate them to rural development operations which have been the subject of a financial adjustment.
Member States shall deduct any sums unduly paid as a result of an outstanding irregularity by a beneficiary, in accordance with this Article, from any future payments to the beneficiary by the paying agency.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, second subparagraph, for interventions for rural development receiving aid from the financial instruments referred to in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, a contribution cancelled as a result of an individual non-compliance may be reused within the same financial instrument as follows:
(a)
where the non-compliance that gives rise to the cancellation of the contribution is detected at the level of the final recipient as defined in Article 2, point (18), of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, only for other final recipients within the same financial instrument;
(b)
where the non-compliance that gives rise to the cancellation of the contribution is detected at the level of the specific fund as defined in Article 2, point (21), of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 within a holding fund as defined in Article 2, point (20), of that Regulation, only for other specific funds.
