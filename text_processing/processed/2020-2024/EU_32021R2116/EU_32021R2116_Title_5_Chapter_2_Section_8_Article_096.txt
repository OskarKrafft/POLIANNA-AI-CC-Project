Article 96
Use of the euro by Member States that have not adopted the euro
1.   If a Member State which has not adopted the euro decides to pay the expenditure resulting from agricultural legislation in euros rather than in its national currency, that Member State shall take measures to ensure that the use of the euro does not provide a systematic advantage compared with the use of national currency.
2.   The Member State shall notify the Commission of the planned measures referred to in paragraph 1 before they come into effect. Those measures shall not take effect until the Commission has notified that Member State of its agreement thereto.
