Article 31
Prefinancing arrangements
1.   Following its implementing decision approving the CAP Strategic Plan, the Commission shall pay an initial prefinancing amount to the Member State for the entire duration of the CAP Strategic Plan. This initial prefinancing amount shall be paid in instalments as follows:
(a)
in 2023: 1 % of the amount of support from the EAFRD for the entire duration of the CAP Strategic Plan;
(b)
in 2024: 1 % of the amount of support from the EAFRD for the entire duration of the CAP Strategic Plan;
(c)
in 2025: 1 % of the amount of support from the EAFRD for the entire duration of the CAP Strategic Plan.
If a CAP Strategic Plan is approved in 2024 or later, the instalments from previous years shall be paid without delay following such approval.
2.   The total amount paid as prefinancing shall be reimbursed to the Commission if no expenditure is effected and no declaration of expenditure for the CAP Strategic Plan is sent within 24 months of the date on which the Commission pays the first instalment of the prefinancing amount. That prefinancing shall be offset against the earliest expenditure declared for the CAP Strategic Plan.
3.   No additional prefinancing shall be paid or recovered where a transfer to or from the EAFRD has taken place in accordance with Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115.
4.   Interest generated on the prefinancing shall be used for the CAP Strategic Plan concerned and deducted from the amount of public expenditure indicated on the final declaration of expenditure.
5.   The total prefinancing amount shall be cleared in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 53 before the CAP Strategic Plan is closed.
