Article 81
Access to information and scrutiny by the Commission
1.   In accordance with the relevant national law, Commission officials shall have access to all documents prepared either with a view to or following the scrutiny organised under this Chapter and to the data held, including those stored in the data-processing systems. Those data shall be provided upon request on an appropriate data support medium.
2.   The scrutiny referred to in Article 77 shall be carried out by the officials of the Member States. Officials of the Commission may participate in that scrutiny but they may not exercise the powers of scrutiny accorded to the officials of the Member States. However, they shall have access to the same premises and to the same documents as the officials of the Member States.
3.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Regulations (Euratom, EC) No 2988/95, (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and (EU) 2017/1939, where national provisions concerning criminal procedure reserve certain acts for officials specifically designated by the national law, neither the officials of the Commission, nor the officials of the requesting Member State, shall take part in those acts. In any event, they shall, in particular, not take part in home visits or the formal questioning of persons in the context of the criminal law of the Member State concerned. They shall, however, have access to information thus obtained.
