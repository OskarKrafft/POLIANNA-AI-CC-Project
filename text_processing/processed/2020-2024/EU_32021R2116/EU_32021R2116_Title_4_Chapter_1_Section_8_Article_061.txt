Article 61
Non-compliance with public procurement rules
Where the non-compliance concerns Union or national rules on public procurement, Member States shall ensure that the part of the aid not to be paid or to be withdrawn is determined on the basis of the gravity of the non-compliance and in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
Member States shall ensure that the legality and regularity of the transaction shall only be affected up to the level of the part of the aid not to be paid or to be withdrawn.
