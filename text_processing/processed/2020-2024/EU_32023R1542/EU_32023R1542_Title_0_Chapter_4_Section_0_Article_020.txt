Article 20
Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the battery. Where that is not possible or not warranted due to the nature of the battery, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the documents accompanying the battery.
2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the battery is placed on the market or put into service.
3.   The CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body where required under Annex VIII. That identification number shall be affixed by the notified body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or by its authorised representative.
4.   The CE marking and the identification number referred to in paragraph 3 may be followed, if applicable, by any pictogram or other mark indicating a special risk, use or any danger linked to the use, storage, treatment or transport of the battery.
5.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.
