Article 15
Presumption of conformity of batteries
1.   For the purposes of compliance and verification of compliance of batteries with the requirements laid down in Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 78, tests, measurements and calculations shall be made using reliable, accurate and reproducible methods which take into account the generally recognised state-of-the-art methods, and the results of which are deemed to be of low uncertainty, including methods set out in standards for which references have been published for those purposes in the Official Journal of the European Union.
2.   Harmonised standards shall aim to simulate real-life usage as far as possible while maintaining standard tests.
3.   Batteries which are in conformity with harmonised standards, or parts thereof, for which references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union shall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements laid down in Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 78 to the extent that those requirements are covered by such harmonised standards or parts thereof, and, if applicable, to the extent that the minimum values established for those requirements pursuant to Articles 9 and 10 are attained.
