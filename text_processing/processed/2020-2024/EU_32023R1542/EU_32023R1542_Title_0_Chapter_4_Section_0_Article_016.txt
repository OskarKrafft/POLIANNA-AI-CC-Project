Article 16
Common specifications
1.   In exceptional cases, the Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down common specifications for the requirements laid down in Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 78 or tests referred to in Article 15(1), where:
(a)
those requirements or tests are not covered by harmonised standards, or parts thereof, for which references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union;
(b)
the Commission has requested one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a harmonised standard for those requirements or tests; and
(c)
at least one of the following conditions has been fulfilled:
(i)
the request of the Commission has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation organisations,
(ii)
the Commission observes undue delays in the adoption of the requested harmonised standards, or
(iii)
a European standardisation organisation has delivered a standard that does not entirely correspond to the request of the Commission.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).
When preparing the draft implementing act establishing the common specifications, the Commission shall take into account the views of relevant bodies or the expert group and shall duly consult all relevant stakeholders.
2.   Batteries which are in conformity with common specifications or parts thereof shall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements laid down in Articles 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 78 to the extent that those requirements are covered by such common specifications or parts thereof, and, if applicable, to the extent that the minimum values established for those requirements pursuant to Articles 9 and 10 are attained.
3.   Where a harmonised standard is adopted by an European standardisation organisation and proposed to the Commission for the purpose of publishing its reference in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall assess the harmonised standard in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. When the reference of a harmonised standard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall repeal the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1, or parts thereof which cover the same requirements or tests referred to in paragraph 1.
