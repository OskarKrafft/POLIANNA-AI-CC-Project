Article 61
Collection of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries
1.   Producers of SLI batteries, industrial batteries and electric vehicle batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall take back, free of charge and without an obligation on the end-user to buy a new battery, nor to have bought the battery from them, and shall ensure that all waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries regardless of their nature, chemical composition, condition, brand, or origin of the respective category that they have made available on the market for the first time in the territory of that Member State are collected separately. For that purpose, they shall accept to take back waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries from end-users, or from take-back and collection systems which include collection points set up by them in cooperation with:
(a)
distributors of SLI batteries, industrial batteries and electric vehicle batteries in accordance with Article 62(1);
(b)
operators carrying out remanufacturing or repurposing of SLI batteries, industrial batteries and electric vehicle batteries;
(c)
waste electrical and electronic equipment and end-of-life vehicle treatment facilities referred to in Article 65 for the waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries arising from their operations;
(d)
public authorities or third parties carrying out waste management on their behalf in accordance with Article 66.
Member States may adopt measures to require that the entities referred to in the first subparagraph, points (a) to (d), may collect waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries only if they have concluded a contract with the producers or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations.
Where waste industrial batteries require prior dismantling at the premises of private, non-commercial users, the obligation of the producer to take back those waste batteries shall not result in any costs related to the dismantling and collection of those waste batteries being borne by those users.
2.   The take-back arrangements put in place in accordance with paragraph 1 shall cover the whole territory of a Member State taking into account population size and density, expected volume of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries, accessibility for and proximity to end-users, not being limited to areas where the collection and subsequent management of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries is profitable.
3.   Producers of SLI batteries, industrial batteries and electric vehicle batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall:
(a)
provide the take back and collection systems referred to in paragraph 1 with suitable collection infrastructure for the separate collection of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries meeting the applicable safety requirements, and cover the necessary costs incurred by those take back and collection systems in relation to the take back activities; the containers for collection and temporary storage of such waste batteries at the take back and collection systems shall be suitable in view of the volume and hazardous nature of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries that are likely to be collected through those collection points;
(b)
collect waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries from the take back and collection systems referred to in paragraph 1 with a frequency that is proportionate to the storage capacity of the separate collection infrastructure and the volume and hazardous nature of waste batteries that are usually collected through those take back and collection systems; and
(c)
provide for the delivery of waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries collected from end-users and from the take back and collection systems referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to permitted facilities for treatment in accordance with Articles 70 and 73.
4.   The entities referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) to (d), of this Article may hand over collected waste SLI batteries, waste industrial batteries and waste electric vehicle batteries to waste management operators selected in accordance with Article 57(8) with a view to their treatment in accordance with Article 70. In such cases, the obligation of producers pursuant to paragraph 3, point (c), of this Article shall be deemed to be met.
