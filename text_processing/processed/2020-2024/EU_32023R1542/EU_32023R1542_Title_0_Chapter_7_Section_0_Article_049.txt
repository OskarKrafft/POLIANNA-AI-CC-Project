Article 49
Economic operator’s management system
1.   Each economic operator referred to in Article 48(1) shall:
(a)
adopt, and clearly communicate to suppliers and the public, a company battery due diligence policy, concerning raw materials listed in point 1 of Annex X, and associated social and environmental risk categories listed in point 2 of Annex X;
(b)
incorporate in its battery due diligence policy standards that are consistent with the standards set out in the internationally recognised due diligence instruments listed in point 4 of Annex X;
(c)
structure its internal management system to support its battery due diligence policy by assigning responsibility to its top management level to oversee its battery due diligence policy as well as maintain records of that system for a minimum of 10 years;
(d)
establish and operate a system of controls and transparency regarding the supply chain, including a chain of custody or traceability system, identifying upstream actors in the supply chain;
(e)
incorporate its battery due diligence policy, including risk management measures, into contracts and agreements with suppliers; and
(f)
establish a grievance mechanism, including an early-warning risk-awareness system and a remediation mechanism, or provide for such mechanisms through collaborative agreements with other economic operators or organisations or by facilitating recourse to an external expert or body, such as an ombudsman; such mechanisms shall be based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
2.   The system referred to in paragraph 1, point (d), shall be supported by documentation that provides at least the following information:
(a)
a description of the raw material, including its trade name and type;
(b)
the name and address of the supplier that supplied the raw material present in the batteries to the economic operator that places the batteries containing the raw material in question on the market;
(c)
the country of origin of the raw material and the market transactions from the raw material’s extraction to the immediate supplier to the economic operator that places the battery on the market;
(d)
the quantities of the raw material present in the battery placed on the market, expressed in percentage or weight;
(e)
third-party verification reports issued by a notified body and concerning the suppliers as referred to in Article 50(3);
(f)
if the reports referred to in point (e) are not available and where the raw material originates from a conflict-affected and high-risk area, additional information in accordance with the specific recommendations for upstream economic operators, as set out in the OECD Due diligence guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, where relevant, such as the mine of origin, locations where the raw material is consolidated, traded and processed, and taxes, fees and royalties are paid.
Third party verification reports referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph shall be made available by suppliers as referred to in Article 50(3) to the downstream operators of the supply chain.
