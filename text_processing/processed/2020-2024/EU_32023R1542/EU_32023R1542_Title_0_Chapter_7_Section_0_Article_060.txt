Article 60
Collection of waste LMT batteries
1.   Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall ensure that all waste LMT batteries, regardless of their nature, chemical composition, condition, brand or origin, are collected separately in the territory of a Member State where they make batteries available on the market for the first time. For that purpose they shall:
(a)
establish a waste LMT battery take back and collection system;
(b)
offer the collection of waste LMT batteries, free of charge, to the entities referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), and provide for the collection of waste LMT batteries from all entities that have made use of that offer (‘connected collection points for LMT batteries’);
(c)
provide for the necessary practical arrangements for collection and transport of waste LMT batteries, including the provision, free of charge, of suitable collection and transport containers meeting the requirements of Directive 2008/68/EC, to the connected collection points for LMT batteries;
(d)
collect, free of charge, the waste LMT batteries collected at the connected collection points for LMT batteries, with a frequency that is proportionate to the area covered and the volume and hazardous nature of the waste LMT batteries usually collected at those collection points;
(e)
collect, free of charge, the waste LMT batteries removed from waste electrical and electronic equipment, with a frequency that is proportionate to the volume and hazardous nature of the waste LMT batteries;
(f)
ensure that the waste LMT batteries collected from the connected collection points for LMT batteries and removed from waste electrical and electronic equipment are subsequently subject to treatment in a permitted facility by a waste management operator in accordance with Article 70.
2.   Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall ensure that the take back and collection system for waste LMT batteries:
(a)
consists of collection points set up by them in cooperation with one or more of the following:
(i)
distributors in accordance with Article 62;
(ii)
end-of-life vehicle treatment facilities subject to Directive 2000/53/EC;
(iii)
public authorities, or third parties carrying out waste management on their behalf, in accordance with Article 66;
(iv)
voluntary collection points in accordance with Article 67;
(v)
waste electrical and electronic equipment treatment facilities subject to Directive 2012/19/EU; and
(b)
covers the whole territory of the Member State taking into account population size and density, expected volume of waste LMT batteries, accessibility for and proximity to end-users, not being limited to areas where the collection and subsequent management of waste LMT batteries is profitable.
3.   Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall attain, and maintain durably, at least the following collection targets of waste LMT batteries:
(a)
51 % by 31 December 2028;
(b)
61 % by 31 December 2031.
Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations shall calculate the collection rate referred to in this paragraph in accordance with Annex XI.
4.   Producers of LMT batteries or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations, shall:
(a)
set up the collection points referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), with suitable collection infrastructure for the separate collection of waste LMT batteries meeting the applicable safety requirements and cover the necessary costs incurred by those collection points in relation to the take back activities; the containers for collection and temporary storage of such waste batteries at the collection points shall be suitable in view of the volume and hazardous nature of waste LMT batteries that are likely to be collected through those collection points;
(b)
collect waste LMT batteries from the collection points referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), with a frequency that is proportionate to the storage capacity of the separate collection infrastructure and the volume and hazardous nature of waste batteries that are usually collected through those collection points; and
(c)
provide for the delivery of waste LMT batteries collected from the collection points referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), of this Article to permitted facilities for treatment in accordance with Articles 70 and 73.
5.   End-users shall be able to discard waste LMT batteries at collection points referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), and shall not be charged or be obliged to buy a new battery or to have bought the LMT battery from the producers who set up the collection points.
6.   Collection points set up in accordance with paragraph 2, points (a)(i), (iii) and (iv), shall not be subject to the registration or permit requirements of Directive 2008/98/EC.
7.   Member States may adopt measures to require that the collection points referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), of this Article may collect waste LMT batteries only if they have concluded a contract with the producers or, where appointed in accordance with Article 57(1), producer responsibility organisations.
8.   In view of the expected development of the market and increase of the expected lifetime of LMT batteries, and in order to better ascertain the actual volume of waste LMT batteries available for collection, the Commission is empowered to adopt, by 18 August 2027, delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to amend the methodology to calculate the collection rate of waste LMT batteries set out in Annex XI and to amend the collection target laid down in paragraph 3 of this Article to adapt the collection target to the new methodology while maintaining equivalent ambition and timelines.
