Article 17
Subcontracting
1.   To encourage new entrants, SMEs and start-ups and their cross-border participation, and to offer the widest possible geographical coverage while protecting the Union’s autonomy, the contracting authority shall request that the tenderer subcontracts part of the contract by competitive tendering at the appropriate levels of subcontracting to companies other than those which belong to the tenderer’s group.
2.   The tenderer shall justify any derogation from a request made under paragraph 1.
3.   For contracts above EUR 10 million, the contracting authority shall aim to ensure that at least 30 % of the value of the contract is subcontracted by competitive tendering at various levels of subcontracting to companies outside the group of the prime tenderer, particularly in order to enable the cross-border participation of SMEs. The Commission shall inform the Programme committee referred to in Article 107(1) on the fulfilment of that objective for contracts signed after the entry into force of this Regulation.
