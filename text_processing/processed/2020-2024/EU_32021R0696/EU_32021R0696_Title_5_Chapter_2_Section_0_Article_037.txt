Article 37
General principles of security accreditation
Security accreditation activities for all of the Programme’s components shall be conducted in accordance with the following principles:
(a)
security accreditation activities and decisions shall be undertaken in a context of collective responsibility for the security of the Union and of the Member States;
(b)
efforts shall be made for decisions within the Security Accreditation Board to be reached by consensus;
(c)
security accreditation activities shall be carried out using a risk assessment and management approach, considering risks to the security of the component concerned as well as the impact on cost or schedule of any measure to mitigate the risks, taking into account the objective not to lower the general level of security of that component;
(d)
decisions of the Security Accreditation Board on security accreditation shall be prepared and taken by professionals who are duly qualified in the field of accrediting complex systems, have an appropriate level of security clearance and who act objectively;
(e)
efforts shall be made to consult all relevant parties with an interest in security issues for the component concerned;

security accreditation activities shall be carried out by all relevant stakeholders of the component concerned in accordance with a security accreditation strategy, without prejudice to the role of the Commission;

decisions of the Security Accreditation Board on security accreditation shall, following the process defined in the relevant security accreditation strategy defined by that Board, be based on local decisions on security accreditation taken by the respective national security accreditation authorities of the Member States;
(h)
a permanent, transparent and fully understandable monitoring process shall ensure that the security risks for the component concerned are known, that security measures are defined to reduce such risks to an acceptable level, in view of the security needs of the Union and of its Member States, and for the smooth running of the component and that those measures are applied in accordance with the concept of defence in depth. The effectiveness of such measures shall be continuously evaluated. The process relating to security risk assessment and management shall be conducted as an iterative process jointly by the stakeholders of the component concerned;

security accreditation activities shall be carried out with due regard for the need for adequate coordination between the Commission and the authorities responsible for implementing security rules;
(k)
the security accreditation of EGNOS performed by the Security Accreditation Board shall be without prejudice to the accreditation activities performed, for aviation, by the European Aviation Safety Agency.
