Article 43
Protection of classified information
1.   The exchange of classified information related to the Programme shall be subject to the existence of an international agreement between the Union and a third country or international organisation on the exchange of classified information or, where applicable, an arrangement entered into by the competent Union institution or body and the relevant authorities of a third country or international organisation on the exchange of classified information, and to the conditions laid down therein.
2.   Natural persons resident in and legal persons established in third countries may deal with EUCI regarding the Programme only where they are subject, in those third countries, to security regulations ensuring a degree of protection at least equivalent to that provided by the Commission’s rules on security set out in Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444 and by the security rules of the Council set out in the Annexes to Decision 2013/488/EU. The equivalence of the security regulations applied in a third country or international organisation shall be defined in a security of information agreement, including, if relevant, industrial security matters, concluded between the Union and that third country or international organisation in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 218 TFEU and taking into account Article 13 of Decision 2013/488/EU.
3.   Without prejudice to Article 13 of Decision 2013/488/EU and to the rules governing the field of industrial security as set out in Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444, a natural person or legal person, third country or international organisation may be given access to EUCI where deemed necessary on a case-by-case basis, according to the nature and content of such information, the recipient’s need-to-know and the degree of advantage to the Union.
