Objectives
1.   The general objectives of the Programme are to:
(a)
provide or contribute to the provision of high-quality and up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space-related data, information and services without interruption and wherever possible at global level, meeting existing and future needs and able to support the Union’s political priorities and related evidence-based and independent decision making, inter alia for climate change, transport and security;
(b)
maximise the socio-economic benefits, in particular by fostering the development of innovative and competitive European upstream and downstream sectors, including SMEs and start-ups, thereby enabling growth and job creation in the Union and promoting the widest possible uptake and use of the data, information and services provided by the Programme’s components both within and outside the Union; while ensuring synergies and complementarity with the Union’s research and technological development activities carried out under Regulation (EU) 2021/695;
(c)
enhance the safety and security of the Union and its Member States and reinforce the autonomy of the Union, in particular in terms of technology;
(d)
promote the role of the Union as a global actor in the space sector, encourage international cooperation, reinforce European space diplomacy including by fostering the principles of reciprocity and fair competition, and to strengthen its role in tackling global challenges, supporting global initiatives including with regard to sustainable development and raising awareness of space as a common heritage of humankind;
(e)
enhance the safety, security and sustainability of all outer space activities pertaining to space objects and debris proliferation, as well as space environment, by implementing appropriate measures, including development and deployment of technologies for spacecraft disposal at the end of operational lifetime and for space debris disposal.
2.   The specific objectives of the Programme are:
(a)
for Galileo and EGNOS: to provide long-term, state-of-the-art and secure positioning, navigation and timing services whilst ensuring service continuity and robustness;
(b)
for Copernicus: to deliver accurate and reliable Earth observation data, information and services integrating other data sources, supplied on a long-term sustainable basis, to support the formulation, implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States’ policies and actions based on user requirements;
(c)
for SSA: to enhance capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects and space debris with the aim of further increasing the performance and autonomy of capabilities under the SST sub-component at Union level, to provide SWE services and to map and network Member States’ capacities under the NEO sub-component;
(d)
for GOVSATCOM: to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services for GOVSATCOM users;
(e)
to support an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space, taking into account the essential security interests of the Union;
(f)
to foster the development of a strong Union space economy, including by supporting the space ecosystem and by reinforcing competitiveness, innovation, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity building in all Member States and Union regions, with particular regard to SMEs and start-ups or natural and legal persons from the Union who are active or wishing to become active in that sector.
