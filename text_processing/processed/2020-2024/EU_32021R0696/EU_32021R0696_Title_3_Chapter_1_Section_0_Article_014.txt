Article 14
Principles of procurement
1.   In procurement procedures for the purpose of the Programme, the contracting authority shall act in accordance with the following principles:
(a)
to promote in all Member States throughout the Union and throughout the supply chain, the widest and most open participation possible by economic operators, in particular start-ups, new entrants and SMEs, including in the case of sub-contracting by the tenderers;
(b)
to ensure effective competition and, where possible, to avoid reliance on a single provider, in particular for critical equipment and services, while taking into account the objectives of technological independence and continuity of services;
(c)
by way of derogation from Article 167 of the Financial Regulation, to use, wherever appropriate, multiple supply sources in order to ensure better overall control of all the Programme’s components, their cost and schedule;
(d)
to follow the principles of open access and fair competition throughout the industrial supply chain, by tendering on the basis of the provision of transparent and timely information, clear communication of the applicable procurement rules and procedures, selection and award criteria and any other relevant information allowing a level-playing field for all potential tenderers, including SMEs and start-ups;
(e)
to reinforce the autonomy of the Union, in particular in technological terms;
(f)
to comply with the security requirements of the Programme’s components and to contribute to the protection of the essential security interests of the Union and its Member States;
(g)
to promote service continuity and reliability;
(h)
to satisfy appropriate social and environmental criteria.
2.   The procurement board, within the Commission, shall scrutinise the procurement process related to all of the Programme’s components and monitor the contractual implementation of the Union budget delegated to entrusted entities. A representative of each of the entrusted entities shall be invited where appropriate.
