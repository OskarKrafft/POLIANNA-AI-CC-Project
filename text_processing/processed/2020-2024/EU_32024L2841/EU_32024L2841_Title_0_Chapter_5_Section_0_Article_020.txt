Article 20
Reporting and assessment
1.   By 5 June 2031, and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions a report on the application of this Directive.
2.   The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall address, inter alia, in the light of social, economic, technological and other relevant developments the use of the European Disability Card and European Parking Card for persons with disabilities, in particular the impact of any fees, the extent to which the implementation of this Directive has met its objectives and its interaction with other relevant Union legal acts with a view to assessing the need to review this Directive.
That report shall also include an analysis of specific situations of disadvantage resulting from intersectional discrimination, which is understood as discrimination based on a combination of disability and any other grounds protected under Council Directive 79/7/EEC (24), 2000/43/EC (25), 2000/78/EC (26) or 2004/113/EC (27), with a particular focus on women and girls with disabilities.
3.   By 5 June 2029, the Commission shall carry out an assessment on any remaining gaps relating to the free movement of persons with disabilities. The Commission shall take due account of the outcome of that assessment when deciding whether further action at Union level is required to address any such gaps.
4.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission, at its request and in due time, the information necessary for the Commission to draw up the report referred to in paragraph 1.
5.   The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall take into account the viewpoints of persons with disabilities, of relevant non-governmental organisations in particular organisations representing persons with disabilities, and of economic stakeholders.
