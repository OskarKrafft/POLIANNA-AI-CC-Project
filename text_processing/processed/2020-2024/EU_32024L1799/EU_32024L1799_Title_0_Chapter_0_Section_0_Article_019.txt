Article 19
Reporting by the Commission and review
1.   By 31 July 2031, the Commission shall submit a report on the application of this Directive. The report shall assess the contribution of this Directive, and in particular that of Articles 5 and 16, to promoting repair in the internal market, including the repair of goods subject to repairability requirements outside the legal guarantee and the consumers’ choice for repair within the legal guarantee as well as its impact on businesses and consumers.
2.   The report shall also assess the effectiveness of incentives to choose repair, including the extension of the legal guarantee, and the need to promote commercial guarantees on repair services and to adopt rules on the liability of repairers for repair.
3.   With regard to Article 7, the report shall assess the effectiveness of the European online platform based on information on the number of active repair service providers and on the number of consumers that accessed the European online platform.
4.   The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions. Member States shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of that report. That report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
5.   The necessary level of harmonisation required to ensure a level-playing field for companies in the internal market including the convergence of and divergence between national laws of the Member States transposing this Directive, in particular regarding the liability periods, shall be assessed in the context of the review provided for in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2019/771.
