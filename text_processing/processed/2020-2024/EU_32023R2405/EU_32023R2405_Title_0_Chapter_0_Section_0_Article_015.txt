Article 15
Flexibility mechanisms
1.   By way of derogation from Article 4(1), from 1 January 2025 until 31 December 2034, for each reporting period, an aviation fuel supplier may supply the minimum shares of SAF defined in Annex I as a weighted average over all the aviation fuel it supplied across Union airports for that reporting period.
2.   By 1 July 2024, the Commission shall identify and assess the developments on SAF production and supply on the Union aviation fuel market as well as assess possible improvements or additional measures to the existing SAF flexibility mechanism referred to in paragraph 1, such as setting up or recognising a system of tradability of SAF to enable fuel supply in the Union without it being physically connected to a supply site, with a view to further facilitate the supply and uptake of SAF for aviation during the flexibility period.
Such a possible system, incorporating elements of a book and claim scheme, could enable aircraft operators or fuel suppliers, or both, to purchase SAF through contractual arrangements with aviation fuel suppliers and to claim the use of SAF at Union airports.
The Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council setting out the main findings of the evaluation carried out pursuant to this paragraph and accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
