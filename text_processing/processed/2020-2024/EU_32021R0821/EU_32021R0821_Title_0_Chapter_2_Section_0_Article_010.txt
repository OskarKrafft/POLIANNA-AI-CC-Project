Article 10
1.   An authorisation shall be required for the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if another Member State imposes an authorisation requirement for the export of those items on the basis of a national control list of items adopted by that Member State pursuant to Article 9 and published by the Commission pursuant to Article 9(4), and if the exporter has been informed by the competent authority that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for uses of concern with respect to public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism, or to human rights considerations.
2.   A Member State which refuses an authorisation required under paragraph 1 shall also inform the Commission and the other Member States of such decision.
3.   A Member State which imposes an authorisation requirement pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article on the export of a dual-use item not listed in Annex I, shall inform its customs authorities and other relevant national authorities about the authorisation requirement without delay and, where appropriate, provide the other Member States and the Commission with the relevant information, in particular concerning the items and end-users concerned. The other Member States shall give due consideration to that information and shall inform their customs authorities and other relevant national authorities thereof.
