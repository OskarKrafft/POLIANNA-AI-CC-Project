Article 29
1.   The Commission and the Member States shall, where appropriate, maintain dialogues with third countries, with a view to promoting the global convergence of controls.
The dialogues may support regular and reciprocal cooperation with third countries, including exchange of information and best practices, as well as capacity-building and outreach to third countries. The dialogues may also encourage the adherence of third countries to robust export controls developed by multilateral export control regimes as a model for international best practice.
2.   Without prejudice to the provisions on mutual administrative assistance agreements or protocols in customs matters concluded between the Union and third countries, the Council may authorise the Commission to negotiate with third countries on agreements providing for the mutual recognition of export controls of dual-use items covered by this Regulation.
Those negotiations shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established in Article 207(3) TFEU and in the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, as appropriate.
