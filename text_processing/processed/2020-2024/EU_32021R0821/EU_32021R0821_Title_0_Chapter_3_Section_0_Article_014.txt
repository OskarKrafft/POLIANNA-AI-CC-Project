Article 14
1.   If the dual-use items in respect of which an application has been made for an individual export authorisation to a destination not listed in Part 2 of Section A of Annex II or to any destination in the case of dual-use items listed in Annex IV are or will be located in one or more Member States other than the one where the application has been made, that fact shall be indicated in the application. The competent authority of the Member State to which the application for authorisation has been made shall immediately consult the competent authorities of the Member States in question and provide the relevant information. That consultation may be carried out using the electronic system referred to in Article 23(6). The Member States consulted shall make known within 10 working days any objections they may have to the granting of such an authorisation, which shall bind the Member State in which the application has been made.
If no objections are received within 10 working days, the Member States consulted shall be regarded as having no objection.
In exceptional cases, any Member State consulted may request the extension of that 10-day period. However, the extension shall not exceed 30 working days.
2.   If an export might prejudice its essential security interests, a Member State may request another Member State not to grant an export authorisation or, if such authorisation has been granted, request its annulment, suspension, modification or revocation. The Member State receiving such a request shall immediately engage in consultations of a non-binding nature with the requesting Member State, to be terminated within 10 working days. In the event that the Member State receiving the request decides to grant the authorisation, that Member State shall notify the Commission and the other Member States thereof using the electronic system referred to in Article 23(6).
