Article 7
1.   The transit of non-Union dual-use items listed in Annex I may be prohibited at any time by the competent authority of the Member State where the items are situated if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1).
2.   Before deciding whether or not to prohibit a transit the competent authority may, in individual cases, impose an authorisation requirement for the specific transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1). If the transit takes place through the territory of multiple Member States, the competent authority of each affected Member State shall be able to prohibit such transit through its territory.
The competent authority may impose the authorisation requirement on the natural or legal person or the partnership that holds the contract with the consignee in the third country and has the power to determine the sending of the items passing through the customs territory of the Union.
If the natural or legal person or the partnership is not resident or established in the customs territory of the Union, the competent authority may impose the authorisation requirement on:
(a)
the declarant within the meaning of Article 5(15) of the Union Customs Code;
(b)
the carrier within the meaning of Article 5(40) of the Union Customs Code; or
(c)
the natural person carrying the dual-use items in transit where those dual-use items are contained in the personal baggage of that person.
3.   A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items.
4.   Article 9(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.
