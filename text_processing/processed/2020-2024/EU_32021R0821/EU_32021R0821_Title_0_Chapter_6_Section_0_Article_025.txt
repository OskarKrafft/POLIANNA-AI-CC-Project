Article 25
1.   Each Member State shall take appropriate measures to ensure the proper enforcement of this Regulation. In particular, it shall lay down the penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation or of those adopted for its implementation. Those penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
2.   The Dual-Use Coordination Group shall set up an enforcement coordination mechanism to support exchange of information and direct cooperation between competent authorities and enforcement agencies of the Member States (the ‘Enforcement Coordination Mechanism’). Under the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism, the Member States and the Commission shall exchange relevant information, where available, including on the application, nature and effect of the measures, taken under paragraph 1, on enforcement of best practices and unauthorised exports of dual-use items and/or infringements of this Regulation and/or relevant national legislation.
Under the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism, the Member States and the Commission shall also exchange information on best practices of national enforcement authorities regarding risk-based audits, the detection and prosecution of unauthorised exports of dual-use items and/or possible other infringements of this Regulation and/or relevant national legislation.
Exchange of information under the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism shall be confidential.
