Article 17
1.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 in order to amend the list of dual-use items set out in Annexes I and IV, as follows:
(a)
the list of dual-use items set out in Annex I shall be amended in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any amendment thereof, that Member States and, where applicable, the Union have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties;
(b)
where the amendment of Annex I concerns dual-use items which are also listed in Annex II or IV, those Annexes shall be amended accordingly.
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 in order to amend Annex II by removing items and by adding or removing destinations from the scope of Union general export authorisations in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group set up pursuant to Article 24 and taking into consideration obligations and commitments under the relevant non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, such as amendments to control lists, as well as relevant geopolitical developments. Where imperative grounds of urgency require a removal of particular destinations from the scope of a Union general export authorisation, the procedure provided for in Article 19 shall apply to delegated acts adopted pursuant to this paragraph.
