Article 86
Budgetary commitments
1.   The decision approving the programme in accordance with Article 23 shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 110(1) of the Financial Regulation and its notification to the Member State concerned shall constitute a legal commitment.
That decision shall specify the total Union contribution per Fund and per year. However, for programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, an amount corresponding to 50 % of the contribution for the years 2026 and 2027 (‘flexibility amount’) per programme in each Member State shall be retained and shall only be definitively allocated to the programme after the adoption of the Commission decision following the mid-term review in accordance with Article 18.
2.   The budgetary commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made by the Commission in annual instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2027.
3.   By way of derogation from Article 111(2) of the Financial Regulation, the budgetary commitments for the first instalment shall follow the adoption of the programme by the Commission.
