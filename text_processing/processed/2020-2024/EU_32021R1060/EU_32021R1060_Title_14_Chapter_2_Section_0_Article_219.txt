Article 100
Calculation of the balance
1.   When the Commission determines the amount chargeable to the Funds for the accounting year and the consequent adjustments in relation to the payments to the Member State, it shall take into account:
(a)
the amounts in the accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 98(3) and to which the co-financing rate for each priority is to be applied;
(b)
the total amount of interim payments made by the Commission during that accounting year;
(c)
for the ERDF, the ESF+, the Cohesion Fund, the JTF and the EMFAF, for the years 2021 and 2022, the amount of pre-financing.
2.   Where there is an amount recoverable from the Member State, it shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting against amounts due to the Member State in subsequent payments to the same programme. Such a recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds to the programme. The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(3) of the Financial Regulation.
