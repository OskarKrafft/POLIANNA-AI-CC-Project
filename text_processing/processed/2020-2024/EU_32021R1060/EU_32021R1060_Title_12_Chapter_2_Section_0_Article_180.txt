Article 61
Differentiated treatment of investors
1.   Support from the Funds to financial instruments invested in final recipients and any type of income generated by those investments, including resources paid back, which are attributable to the support from the Funds, may be used for differentiated treatment of investors operating under the market economy principle through an appropriate sharing of risks and profits, taking into account the principle of sound financial management.
2.   The level of such differentiated treatment shall not exceed that which is necessary to create incentives for attracting private resources, established either by a competitive process or an independent assessment.
