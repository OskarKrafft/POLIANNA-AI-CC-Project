Article 85
Adjustment during the programming period
1.   Where the Commission or the audit authority conclude, based on the audits carried out and the annual control report, that the conditions set out in Article 84 are no longer fulfilled, the Commission shall request the audit authority to carry out additional audit work in accordance with Article 69(3) and satisfy itself that remedial actions are taken.
2.   Where the subsequent annual control report confirms that the conditions continue not to be fulfilled, thus limiting the assurance provided to the Commission on the effective functioning of the management and control systems and of the legality and regularity of expenditure, the Commission shall request the audit authority to carry out system audits.
3.   The Commission may, after having given to the Member State the opportunity to present its observations, inform the Member State that the enhanced proportionate arrangements set out in Article 83 shall no longer be applied from the start of the subsequent accounting year.
