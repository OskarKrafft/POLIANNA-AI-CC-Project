Article 31
Community-led local development
1.   Where a Member State considers it appropriate pursuant to Article 28, the ERDF, the ESF+, the JTF and the EMFAF shall support community-led local development.
2.   The Member State shall ensure that community-led local development is:
(a)
focused on subregional areas;
(b)
led by local action groups composed of representatives of public and private local socioeconomic interests, in which no single interest group controls the decision-making;
(c)
carried out through strategies in accordance with Article 32;
(d)
supportive of networking, accessibility, innovative features in the local context and, where appropriate, cooperation with other territorial actors.
3.   Where support to strategies referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 is available from more than one Fund, the relevant managing authorities shall organise a joint call for selection of those strategies and establish a joint committee for all the Funds concerned to monitor the implementation of those strategies. The relevant managing authorities may choose one of the Funds concerned to support all preparatory, management and animation costs referred to in points (a) and (c) of Article 34(1) related to those strategies.
4.   Where the implementation of such a strategy involves support from more than one Fund, the relevant managing authorities may choose one of the Funds concerned as the Lead Fund.
5.   While respecting the scope and the eligibility rules of each fund involved in supporting the strategy, the rules of the Lead Fund shall apply to that strategy. The authorities of other funds shall rely on decisions and management verifications made by the competent authority of the Lead Fund.
6.   The authority of the Lead Fund shall provide the authorities of other Funds with information necessary to monitor and make payments in accordance with the rules set out in the Fund-specific Regulations.
