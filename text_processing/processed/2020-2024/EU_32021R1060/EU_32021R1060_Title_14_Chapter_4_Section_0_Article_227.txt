Article 108
Geographical coverage of support for the Investment for jobs and growth goal
1.   The ERDF, the ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund shall support the Investment for jobs and growth goal in all regions corresponding to level 2 of the common classification of territorial units for statistics (‘NUTS level 2 regions’) established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2016/2066.
2.   Resources from the ERDF and ESF+ for the Investment for jobs and growth goal shall be allocated among the following three categories of NUTS level 2 regions:
(a)
less developed regions, whose GDP per capita is less than 75 % of the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 (‘less developed regions’);
(b)
transition regions, whose GDP per capita is between 75 % and 100 % of the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 (‘transition regions’);
(c)
more developed regions, whose GDP per capita is above 100 % of the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 (‘more developed regions’).
The classification of regions under one of the three categories of region shall be determined on the basis of how the GDP per capita of each region, measured in purchasing power standards (PPS) and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2015-2017, relates to the average GDP per capita of the EU-27 for the same reference period.
3.   The Cohesion Fund shall support those Member States whose gross national income (GNI) per capita, measured in PPS and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2015-2017, is less than 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 for the same reference period.
4.   The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing act, setting out the list of regions fulfilling the criteria of one of the three categories of region and of Member States fulfilling the criteria of paragraph 3. That list shall be valid from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027.
