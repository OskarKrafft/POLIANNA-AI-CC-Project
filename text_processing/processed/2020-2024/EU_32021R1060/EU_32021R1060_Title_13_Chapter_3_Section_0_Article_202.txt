Article 83
Enhanced proportionate arrangements
The Member State may apply the following enhanced proportionate arrangements for the management and control system of a programme where the conditions set out in Article 84 are fulfilled:
(a)
by way of derogation from point (a) of Article 74(1) and Article 74(2), the managing authority may apply only national procedures to carry out management verifications;
(b)
by way of derogation from Article 77(1) regarding system audits and Article 79(1) and (3) regarding audits of operations, the audit authority may limit its audit activity to audits of operations covering a sample based on a statistical selection of 30 sampling units for the programme or group of programmes concerned;
For the purposes of management verifications referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the managing authority may rely on verifications carried out by external bodies provided that it has sufficient evidence of the competence of those bodies.
For point (b) of the first subparagraph, where the population consists of less than 300 sampling units, the audit authority may apply a non-statistical sampling method in accordance with Article 79(2).
The Commission shall limit its own audits to a review of the work of the audit authority through re-performance at its level only, unless available information suggests a serious deficiency in the work of the audit authority.
