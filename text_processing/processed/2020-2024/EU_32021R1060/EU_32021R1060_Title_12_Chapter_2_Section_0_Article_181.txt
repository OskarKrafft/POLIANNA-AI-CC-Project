Article 62
Re-use of resources attributable to the support from the Funds
1.   Resources paid back, before the end of the eligibility period, to financial instruments from investments in final recipients or from the release of resources set aside for guarantee contracts, including capital repayments and any type of generated income that is attributable to the support from the Funds, shall be re-used in the same or other financial instruments for further investments in final recipients, to cover the losses in the nominal amount of the Funds contribution to the financial instrument resulting from negative interest, if such losses occur despite active treasury management, or for any management costs and fees associated to such further investments, taking into account the principle of sound financial management.
2.   Member States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the resources referred to in paragraph 1 and paid back to financial instruments during a period of at least 8 years after the end of the eligibility period, are re-used in accordance with the policy objectives of the programme or programmes under which they were set up, either within the same financial instrument or, following the exit of those resources from the financial instrument, in other financial instruments or in other forms of support.
