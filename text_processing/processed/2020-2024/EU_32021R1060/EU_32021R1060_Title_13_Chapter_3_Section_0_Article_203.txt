Article 84
Conditions for application of enhanced proportionate arrangements
1.   The Member State may apply the enhanced proportionate arrangements referred to in Article 83 at any time during the programming period, where the Commission has confirmed in its published annual activity reports, for the last 2 years preceding such a decision by the Member State, that the management and control system of the programme is functioning effectively and that the total error rate for each year is 2 % or below. When assessing the effective functioning of the management and control system of the programme, the Commission shall take into account the participation of the Member State concerned in the enhanced cooperation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Where a Member State decides to apply the enhanced proportionate arrangements referred to in Article 83, it shall notify the Commission on the application of such arrangements. In such a case the arrangements shall apply from the start of the subsequent accounting year.
2.   At the start of the programming period, the Member State may apply the enhanced proportionate arrangements referred to in Article 83, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article are met with respect to a similar programme implemented in 2014-2020 and where the management and control arrangements established for the 2021-2027 programme build largely on those from the previous programme. In such a case, the arrangements shall apply from the start of the programme.
3.   The Member State shall establish or update accordingly the description of the management and control system and the audit strategy set out in Article 69(11) and Article 78.
