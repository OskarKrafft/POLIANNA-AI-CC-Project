Article 33
Local action groups
1.   Local action groups shall design and implement the strategies referred to in point (c) of Article 31(2).
2.   The managing authorities shall ensure that the local action groups are inclusive, and that they either select one partner within the group as a lead partner in administrative and financial matters or come together in a legally constituted common structure.
3.   The following tasks shall be carried out exclusively by the local action groups:
(a)
building the capacity of local actors to develop and implement operations;
(b)
drawing up a non-discriminatory and transparent selection procedure and criteria, which avoids conflicts of interest and ensures that no single interest group controls selection decisions;
(c)
preparing and publishing calls for proposals;
(d)
selecting operations and fixing the amount of support and presenting the proposals to the body responsible for final verification of eligibility before approval;
(e)
monitoring progress towards the achievement of objectives of the strategy;
(f)
evaluating the implementation of the strategy.
4.   Where local action groups carry out tasks not covered by paragraph 3 that fall under the responsibility of the managing authority, or of the paying agency where the EAFRD is selected as a Lead Fund, these local action groups shall be identified by the managing authority as intermediate bodies in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.
5.   The local action group may be a beneficiary and may implement operations in accordance with the strategy, provided that the local action group ensures that the principle of separation of functions is respected.
