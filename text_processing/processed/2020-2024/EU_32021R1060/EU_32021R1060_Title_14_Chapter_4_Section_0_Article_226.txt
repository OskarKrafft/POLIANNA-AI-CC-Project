Article 107
Procedure for decommitment
1.   On the basis of the information it has received as of 31 January, the Commission shall inform the Member State of the amount of the decommitment resulting from that information.
2.   The Member State shall have 2 months to agree to the amount to be decommitted or to submit its observations.
3.   By 30 June, the Member State shall submit to the Commission an amended financing plan reflecting, for the calendar year concerned, the reduced amount of support over one or more priorities of the programme. For programmes supported by more than one Fund, the amount of support shall be reduced by Fund proportionately to the amounts concerned by the decommitment that had not been used in the calendar year concerned.
In the absence of such a submission, the Commission shall amend the financing plan by reducing the contribution from the Funds for the calendar year concerned. That reduction shall be allocated to each priority proportionately to the amounts concerned by the decommitment that had not been used in the calendar year concerned.
4.   The Commission shall amend the decision approving the programme no later than 31 October.
