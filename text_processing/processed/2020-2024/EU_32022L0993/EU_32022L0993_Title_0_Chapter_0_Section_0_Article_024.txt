Article 24
Port State control procedures
1.   Without prejudice to Directive 2009/16/EC, port State control pursuant to Article 23 shall be limited to the following:
(a)
verification that every seafarer serving on board who is required to hold a certificate of competency and/or a certificate of proficiency in accordance with the STCW Convention holds such a certificate of competency or a valid dispensation and/or certificate of proficiency, or provides documentary proof that an application for an endorsement attesting recognition of a certificate of competency has been submitted to the authorities of the flag State;
(b)
verification that the numbers and certificates of the seafarers serving on board are in accordance with the safe-manning requirements of the authorities of the flag State.
2.   The ability of the ship’s seafarers to maintain watchkeeping and security standards, as appropriate, as required by the STCW Convention shall be assessed in accordance with Part A of the STCW Code if there are clear grounds for believing that such standards are not being maintained because any of the following has occurred:
(a)
the ship has been involved in a collision, grounding or stranding;
(b)
there has been a discharge of substances from the ship when underway, at anchor or at berth which is illegal under an international convention;
(c)
the ship has been manoeuvred in an erratic or unsafe manner whereby routing measures adopted by the IMO, or safe navigation practices and procedures have not been followed;
(d)
the ship is otherwise being operated in such a manner as to pose a danger to persons, property or the environment, or to compromise security;
(e)
a certificate has been fraudulently obtained or the holder of a certificate is not the person to whom that certificate was originally issued;
(f)
the ship is flying the flag of a country which has not ratified the STCW Convention, or has a master, officer or rating holding a certificate issued by a third country which has not ratified the STCW Convention.
3.   Notwithstanding verification of the certificate, assessment under paragraph 2 may require the seafarer to demonstrate the relevant competence at the place of duty. Such a demonstration may include verification that operational requirements in respect of watchkeeping standards have been met and that there is a proper response to emergency situations within the seafarer’s level of competence.
