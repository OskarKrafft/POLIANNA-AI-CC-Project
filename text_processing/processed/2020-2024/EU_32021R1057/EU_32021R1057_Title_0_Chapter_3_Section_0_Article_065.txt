Article 23
Indicators and reporting
1.   Priorities addressing material deprivation shall use common output and result indicators, as set out in Annex III to monitor progress in implementation. Those priorities may also use programme-specific indicators.
2.   The reference values of common and programme-specific result indicators shall be established.
3.   Managing authorities shall report twice to the Commission the results of a structured survey of the end recipients regarding the support received from the ESF+ and also focusing on their living conditions and the nature of their material deprivation, carried out during the previous year. That survey shall be based on the model which shall be established by the Commission by means of an implementing act. The first such reporting shall take place by 30 June 2025 and the second by 30 June 2028.
4.   The Commission shall adopt an implementing act establishing the model to be used for the structured survey of end recipients in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 38(2) in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article.
5.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 37 to amend the indicators in Annex III where considered to be necessary to ensure effective assessment of progress in the implementation of programmes. Such amendments shall be proportionate taking into account the administrative burden borne by Member States and beneficiaries. Delegated acts in accordance with this paragraph shall not change the methodology for data collection as laid down in Annex III.
