Article 4
Amendment to Regulation (EU) No 228/2013
The following Article is inserted:
‘Article 22a
Interbranch agreements in Réunion
1.   Pursuant to Article 349 of the Treaty, by way of derogation from Article 101(1) of the Treaty and notwithstanding Article 164(4), first subparagraph, points (a) to (n), of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, where an interbranch organisation recognised pursuant to Article 157 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 operates exclusively in Réunion and is considered to represent the production of, trade in or processing of one specified product, France may, at the request of that organisation, extend to other operators who are not members of that interbranch organisation rules aimed at supporting the maintenance and diversification of local production in order to increase food security in Réunion, provided that those rules apply only to those operators whose activities are solely carried out in Réunion in relation to products which are destined for the local market. Notwithstanding Article 164(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, an interbranch organisation is to be regarded as being a representative under this Article where it accounts for at least 70 % of the volume of production, trade or processing of the product or products concerned.
2.   By way of derogation from Article 165 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, where the rules of a recognised interbranch organisation operating exclusively in Réunion are extended under paragraph 1 of this Article, and the activities covered by those rules are in the general economic interest of economic operators whose activities are solely carried out in Réunion in relation to products which are destined for the local market, France may, after consulting the relevant stakeholders, decide that individual economic operators or groups which are not members of the organisation but which operate on that local market are to pay the organisation all or part of the financial contributions paid by its members, to the extent that such contributions are intended to cover costs that are directly incurred as a result of pursuing the activities in question.
3.   France shall inform the Commission of any agreement whose scope is extended in accordance with this Article.’.
