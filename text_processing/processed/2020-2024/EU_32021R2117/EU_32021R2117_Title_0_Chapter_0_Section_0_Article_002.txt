Applications shall describe and state reasons for the amendments requested.
2.   Amendments to a product specification shall be classified into two categories as regards their importance: Union amendments requiring an objection procedure at Union level and standard amendments to be dealt with at Member State or third country level.
For the purposes of this Regulation, “Union amendment” means an amendment to a product specification that:

includes a change in the name of the protected designation of origin or the protected geographical indication;
(b)
consists of a change, a deletion or an addition of a category of grapevine products referred to in Annex VII, Part II;

Applications for approval of Union amendments submitted by third countries or by third country producers shall contain proof that the requested amendment complies with the laws on the protection of designations of origin or geographical indications in force in that third country.
Applications for approval of Union amendments shall relate exclusively to Union amendments. If an application for a Union amendment also relates to standard amendments, the parts relating to standard amendments shall be deemed as not having been submitted, and the procedure for Union amendments shall apply only to the parts relating to that Union amendment.
The scrutiny of such applications shall focus on the proposed Union amendments.
4.   Standard amendments shall be approved and made public by Member States in whose territory the geographical area of the product concerned is located and communicated to the Commission.
As regards third countries, amendments shall be approved in accordance with the law applicable in the third country concerned.’;

Union symbols indicating the protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication and the Union indications “protected designation of origin” or “protected geographical indication” may appear on the labelling only after the publication of the decision conferring protection on that designation of origin or geographical indication.
