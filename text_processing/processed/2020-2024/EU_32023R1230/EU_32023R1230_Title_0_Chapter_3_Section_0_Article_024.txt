Article 24
Rules for affixing the CE marking to machinery and related products
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the machinery or related product. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the machinery or related product, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the documents accompanying the machinery or related product.
2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the machinery or related product is placed on the market or put into service.
3.   Where the conformity of machinery or a related product is assessed in accordance with the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 25(2), points (a), (b) and (c) and in Article 25(3), points (b), (c) and (d), the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body involved in that procedure.
The identification number of that notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s authorised representative.
4.   The CE marking and, where applicable, the identification number of the notified body may be followed by a pictogram or any other marking indicating a special risk or use.
5.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking.
