1.   Two years after the start of the implementation of the Plans, the Commission shall provide the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions with an evaluation report on the implementation and functioning of the Fund, taking into account the results of the first reports submitted by Member States in accordance with Article 24, and shall submit, where appropriate, any proposals for amendments to this Regulation.
2.   The evaluation report referred to in paragraph 1 shall, in particular, assess:
(a)
the extent to which the objectives of the Fund set out in Article 3 have been achieved, the efficiency of the use of the resources and the Union added value;
(b)
on a country-by-country basis, the efficiency of measures and investments and the use of the direct income support in light of the achievement of the milestones and targets set out in the Plans;
(c)
how the definitions of energy poverty and transport poverty are applied in Member States, based on the information referred to in Article 6(1), point (f), as well as whether amendments to such definitions are necessary;
(d)
the continued relevance of all objectives, and measures and investments set out in Article 8 of this Regulation in light of the impact on greenhouse gas emissions of the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and road transport within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC and of the national measures taken to meet the binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council (36), as well as the continued relevance of the assigned revenues in relation to possible developments concerning the auctioning of allowances under the emission trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors pursuant to Chapter IVa of Directive 2003/87/EC and other relevant considerations.
3.   By 31 December 2033, the Commission shall provide the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions with an independent ex post evaluation report. The ex post evaluation report shall consist of a global assessment of the Fund and shall include information on its impact.
4.   Without prejudging the multiannual financial framework post 2027, in the event revenue generated from the auctioning of allowances referred to in Article 30d(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC is established as an own resource in accordance with Article 311(3) TFEU, the Commission shall, as appropriate, present the necessary proposals in order to ensure, within the framework of the multiannual financial framework post 2027, the effectiveness and continuity of the implementation of the Fund, which is temporarily and exceptionally financed by external assigned revenue generated from allowances of the emission trading system.
