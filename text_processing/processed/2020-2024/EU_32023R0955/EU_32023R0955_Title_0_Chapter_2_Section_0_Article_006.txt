envisaged milestones, targets and an indicative comprehensive timetable for the implementation of the measures and investments to be completed by 31 July 2032;

(p)
where applicable and relevant, an explanation of how geographic specificities, such as islands, outermost regions and territories, rural or remote areas, less accessible peripheries, mountainous areas or areas lagging behind, have been taken into account in the Plan;

its territorial just transition plans under Regulation (EU) 2021/1056.
4.   During the preparation of the Plans, the Commission shall organise an exchange of good practices, including on cost-effective measures and investments to be included in the Plans.

6.   To assist Member States in providing the information referred to in paragraph 1, point (d), of this Article the Commission shall provide a common value to be considered as an estimate for the carbon price resulting from the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, road transport and additional sectors within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC.
7.   Each Member State shall use the template set out in Annex V for the Plan.
