3.   The maximum financial allocation referred to in paragraph 2, point (b), of this Article shall be determined on the basis of the estimated total costs of the Plan proposed by the Member State, as assessed by reference to the criteria set out in Article 16(3).
The amount of the maximum financial allocation referred to in paragraph 2, point (b), of this Article shall be set as follows:
(a)
where the Plan complies satisfactorily with the criteria set out in Article 16(3), and the amount of the estimated total costs of the Plan minus the national contribution is equal to, or higher than, the maximum financial allocation for that Member State referred to in Article 14(1), the financial allocation allocated to the Member State shall be equal to the total amount of the maximum financial allocation referred to in Article 14(1);

where the Plan complies satisfactorily with the criteria set out in Article 16(3), and the amount of the estimated total costs of the Plan minus the national contribution is lower than the maximum financial allocation for that Member State referred to in Article 14(1), the financial allocation allocated to the Member State shall be equal to the amount of the estimated total costs of the Plan minus the national contribution;

where the Plan complies satisfactorily with the criteria set out in Article 16(3), but the assessment identifies weaknesses in the internal control systems, the Commission may require that additional measures to address those weaknesses be included in the Plan and be achieved by the Member State before the first payment;
(d)
where the Plan does not comply satisfactorily with the criteria set out in Article 16(3), no financial allocation shall be allocated to the Member State.
