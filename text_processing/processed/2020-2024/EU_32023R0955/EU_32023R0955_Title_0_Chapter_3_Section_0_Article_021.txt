To that effect, the Member States shall provide an effective and efficient internal control system as further set out in Annex III and the recovery of amounts wrongly paid or incorrectly used. Member States may rely on their regular national budget management systems.

(ii)
a summary of the audits carried out in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards, including the scope of those audits in terms of amount of spending covered and period of time covered and an analysis of the weaknesses identified and any corrective action taken;
(d)

to expressly authorise the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, to exert their rights as provided for in Article 129(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and to impose obligations on all final recipients of the financial allocations paid for implementing the measures and investments included in the Plan, or to all other persons or entities involved in their implementation to expressly authorise the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, where applicable, EPPO to exert their rights as provided for in Article 129(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 and to impose similar obligations on all final recipients of funds disbursed;
(f)
to keep records in accordance with Article 132 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, the point of reference being the payment transaction relevant to the respective measure or investment.
The information referred to in point (d)(ii) of the first subparagraph of this Article shall be required only where the value of public procurement is greater than the Union thresholds set out in Article 4 of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (34).

The personal data shall be processed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, whichever is applicable.

When deciding on the amount of the recovery and reduction the Commission shall respect the principle of proportionality and shall take into account the seriousness of the fraud, corruption and conflict of interests affecting the financial interests of the Union, or of a breach of an obligation. The Commission shall give the Member State the opportunity to present its observations before the reduction is made.
