Article 4
Social Climate Plans
1.   Each Member State shall submit to the Commission its Plan. The Plan shall contain a coherent set of existing or new national measures and investments to address the impact of carbon pricing on vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises and vulnerable transport users in order to ensure affordable heating, cooling and mobility, while accompanying and accelerating necessary measures to meet the climate targets of the Union.
2.   Each Member State shall ensure consistency between its Plan and its updated integrated national energy and climate plan referred to in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
3.   The Plan may include national measures providing temporary direct income support to vulnerable households and vulnerable transport users to reduce the impact of the increase in the price of fossil fuels resulting from the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and road transport within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC.
4.   The Plan shall include national and, where relevant, local and regional measures and investments, in accordance with Article 8, to:
(a)
carry out building renovation, and decarbonise heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of renewable energy generation and storage;
(b)
increase the uptake of zero- and low-emission mobility and transport.
5.   Where a Member State has already in place a national emission trading system for buildings and road transport or carbon tax, the national measures already in place to mitigate social impacts and challenges may be included in the Plan provided that they comply with this Regulation.
