1.   The Member State may include in the estimated total costs of the Plan the following measures and investments with lasting impacts, provided they principally target vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises or vulnerable transport users and intend to:
(a)
support building renovations, in particular for vulnerable households and vulnerable micro-enterprises occupying the worst performing buildings, and including for tenants and people living in social housing;
(b)
support access to affordable energy-efficient housing, including social housing;
(c)
contribute to the decarbonisation, such as through electrification, of heating and cooling of, and cooking in, buildings by providing access to affordable and energy-efficient systems, and by integrating renewable energy generation and storage, including through renewable energy communities, citizen energy communities and other active customers to promote the uptake of the self-consumption of renewable energy, such as energy sharing and peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy, connection to smart grids and to district heating networks, that contributes to achieving energy savings or to reducing energy poverty;
(d)
provide targeted, accessible and affordable information, education, awareness and advice on cost-effective measures and investments, available support for building renovations and energy efficiency, as well as sustainable and affordable mobility and transport alternatives;
(e)
support public and private entities, including social housing providers, in particular public-private cooperatives, in developing and providing affordable energy efficiency solutions and appropriate funding instruments in line with the social goals of the Fund;
(f)
provide access to zero- and low-emission vehicles and bicycles, while maintaining technological neutrality, including financial support or fiscal incentives for their purchase as well as for appropriate public and private infrastructure, in particular, where relevant, purchase of zero- and low-emission vehicles, infrastructure for recharging and refuelling and development of a second-hand zero-emission vehicles market; Member States shall aim to ensure that where zero-emission vehicles are an affordable and deployable solution, support to such vehicles is prioritised in their Plans;
(g)
incentivise the use of affordable and accessible public transport and support private and public entities, including cooperatives, in developing and providing sustainable mobility on demand, shared mobility services and active mobility options.
2.   Member States may include in the estimated total costs of the Plans the costs of measures providing direct income support to vulnerable households and vulnerable transport users to reduce the impact of the increase in road transport and heating fuel prices. Such support shall be temporary and decrease over time. Member States may provide temporary direct income support if their Plans contain measures or investments aimed at those vulnerable households and vulnerable transport users in accordance with Article 8(1) of this Regulation. Such support shall be limited to the direct impact of the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and road transport within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC. The costs of measures providing temporary direct income support shall not represent more than 37,5 % of the estimated total costs of the Plan, as referred to in Article 6(1), point (j), of this Regulation.
3.   Member States may include in the estimated total costs of the Plans the costs of technical assistance to cover expenses related to training, programming, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities which are required for the management of the Fund and the achievement of its objectives, for example studies, information technology (IT) expenses, public consultation of stakeholders, information and communication actions. The costs of such technical assistance shall be up to 2,5 % of the estimated total costs of the Plan, as referred to in Article 6(1), point (j).
