1.   The Commission shall assess the Plan and, where applicable, any amendment to that Plan submitted by a Member State in accordance with Article 18, for compliance with this Regulation. When carrying out that assessment, the Commission shall act in close cooperation with the Member State concerned. The Commission may make observations or seek additional information within two months from the date of submission of the Plan by the Member State. The Member State shall provide the requested additional information and may revise the Plan if needed, including after the submission of the Plan. The Member State and the Commission may agree to extend the deadline for assessment by a reasonable period if necessary.
2.   The Commission shall assess whether transfers requested in accordance with Article 11 meet the objectives of this Regulation.
3.   The Commission shall assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of the Plan, taking into account the specific challenges and the financial allocation of the Member State, as follows:
(a)
for the purpose of assessing relevance, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria:
(i)
whether the Plan represents an adequate response to the social impact on and challenges faced by vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises and vulnerable transport users in the Member State concerned from the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and road transport within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC, in particular households in energy poverty or households in transport poverty, duly taking into account the challenges identified in the assessments of the Commission of the update of the concerned Member State’s integrated national energy and climate plan and of its progress pursuant to Article 9(3), and Articles 13 and 29 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, as well as in the Commission recommendations to Member States issued pursuant to Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in view of the Union’s 2030 climate and energy targets and long-term objective of climate neutrality in the Union at the latest by 2050;
(ii)
whether the Plan is expected to ensure that measures and investments included in the Plan do not significantly harm environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and whether the Plan helps reduce fossil fuel dependency;
(iii)
whether the Plan contains measures and investments that contribute to the green transition, including to addressing the social impacts and challenges resulting therefrom and in particular to the achievement of the Union’s 2030 climate and energy targets and long-term objective of climate neutrality in the Union at the latest by 2050 and the 2030 milestones of the Union’s Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy;
(b)
for the purpose of assessing effectiveness, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria:
(i)
whether the Plan is expected to have a lasting impact in the Member State on the challenges addressed by that Plan, in line with the Union’s 2030 climate and energy targets and long-term objective of climate neutrality in the Union at the latest by 2050, and in particular on vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises and vulnerable transport users, in particular households in energy poverty or households in transport poverty;
(ii)
whether the arrangements proposed by the Member State are expected to ensure the effective monitoring and implementation of the Plan, including the envisaged timetable, milestones and targets, and the related indicators;
(iii)
whether the measures and investments proposed by the Member State are consistent and compliant with the requirements of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency (recast), Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, and repealing Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (32) and Directive 2010/31/EU; and
(iv)
whether the measures and investments proposed by the Member State foster complementarity, synergy, coherence and consistency with the Union instruments referred to in Article 6(3).
(c)
for the purposes of assessing efficiency, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria:
(i)
whether the justification provided by the Member State for the amount of the estimated total costs of the Plan is reasonable, plausible, in line with the principle of cost efficiency and commensurate with the expected national environmental and social impact, while also taking into account national specificities that could impact the costs provided in the Plan;
(ii)
whether the arrangements proposed by the Member State are expected to prevent, detect and correct corruption, fraud and conflicts of interests when using the financial allocation provided under the Fund, including the arrangements that aim to avoid double funding from the Fund and other Union programmes;
(iii)
