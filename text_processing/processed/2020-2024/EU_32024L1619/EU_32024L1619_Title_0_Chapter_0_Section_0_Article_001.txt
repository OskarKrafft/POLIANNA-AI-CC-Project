‘Article 4a
Supervisory independence of competent authorities
1.   For the purposes of this Article, “members of the competent authority’s governance body” means natural persons that form part of the most senior collective decision-making body of the competent authority and who are vested with the power to exercise executive functions regarding the day-to-day management of the supervisory function of the competent authority, excluding governors of national central banks.
2.   For the purpose of preserving the independence of competent authorities in the exercise of their powers, Member States shall provide for the necessary arrangements to ensure that competent authorities, including their members of staff and the members of their governance bodies, can exercise their supervisory powers independently and objectively, without seeking or taking instructions from supervised institutions, from any body of the Union or any government of a Member State or from any other public or private body. Member States shall ensure that the governance bodies of competent authorities are functionally independent of other public and private bodies. Those arrangements shall be without prejudice to the arrangements under national law whereby competent authorities are subject to public and democratic accountability.
Member States shall ensure that no member of a competent authority’s governance body who is appointed after 11 January 2026 remains in office for more than 14 years. Member States shall ensure that members of a competent authority’s governance body are appointed on the basis of published criteria that are objective and transparent and that those members can be dismissed if they no longer meet the criteria of appointment or have been convicted of a serious criminal offence. The reasons for dismissal shall be made public unless the member of the competent authority’s governance body concerned objects to the publication.
Member States shall ensure that competent authorities publish their objectives, are accountable for the discharge of their duties in relation to those objectives and are subject to financial control in a manner which does not affect their independence.
This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of competent authorities pursuant to international or European systems of financial supervision, in particular the European system of financial supervision established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (*3), the single supervisory mechanism established pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (*4) and Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank (*5), and the Single Resolution Mechanism established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*6).
3.   Member States shall, in particular, ensure that competent authorities have in place all the necessary arrangements to prevent conflicts of interest of their members of staff and of the members of their governance bodies. For that purpose, Member States shall lay down rules that are proportionate to the role and responsibilities of the members of staff and the members of governance bodies, and that, at a minimum, prohibit them from:
(a)
trading in financial instruments issued by or referenced to the institutions supervised by their competent authorities, and the direct or indirect parent undertakings, subsidiaries or affiliates of those institutions, with the exception of:
(i)
instruments managed by third parties, provided that the owners of those instruments are precluded from intervening in the management of the portfolio;
(ii)
investments in collective investment undertakings;
(b)
being hired by or accepting any kind of contract for the provision of professional services during a certain period (“cooling-off period”) with any of the following:
(i)
institutions with which the member of staff or the member of the competent authority’s governance body has been directly involved for the purposes of supervision or decision-making, including the direct or indirect parent undertakings, subsidiaries or affiliates of those institutions;
(ii)
entities providing services to any of the entities referred to in point (i), unless the member of staff or the member of the competent authority’s governance body is strictly precluded from taking part in the provision of those services during the cooling-off period;
(iii)
entities conducting lobbying and advocacy activities directed at the competent authority on matters for which the member of staff or the member of the competent authority’s governance body was responsible during that member’s employment or term of office.
The exceptions provided for in the first subparagraph, points (a)(i) and (ii), shall only apply where the third parties and collective investment undertakings do not predominantly invest in instruments issued by or referenced to the entities referred to in point (a).
4.   The cooling-off period shall start from the date on which direct involvement in the supervision of the entities referred to in paragraph 3, point (b)(i), ceased. Competent authorities shall ensure that their members of staff and the members of their governance bodies have no access to confidential or sensitive information relating to those entities during the cooling-off period. In the case of hirings by entities referred to in paragraph 3, points (b)(i) and (ii), the length of the cooling-off period shall be no less than six months for members of staff directly involved in the supervision of entities referred to in paragraph 3, point (b)(i), and no less than 12 months for members of the competent authority’s governance body. In the case of hirings by entities referred to in paragraph 3, point (b)(iii), the length of the cooling-off period shall be no less than three months for both members of staff and members of the competent authority’s governance body.
Member States may allow competent authorities to subject their members of staff and the members of their governance bodies to whom paragraph 3, point (b)(i), applies to a cooling-off period in the event of their hiring by direct competitors of one of the entities referred to in that point. For those purposes, the length of the cooling-off period shall be no less than three months for members of staff directly involved in the supervision of those entities and no less than six months for members of the competent authority’s governance body.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, Member States may allow competent authorities to apply shorter cooling-off periods of a minimum of three months for the members of staff directly involved in the supervision of institutions only where a longer cooling-off period:
(a)
would unduly restrict the ability of the competent authority to hire new members of staff with the adequate or necessary skills to exercise its supervisory functions, in particular taking into account the small size of the national labour market; or
(b)
would constitute a breach of any relevant fundamental right recognised in the constitution of the Member State concerned, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, or of any relevant workers’ rights as set out in national labour law.
6.   Members of staff and members of a competent authority’s governance body subject to the prohibition provided for in paragraph 3, point (b), shall be entitled to appropriate compensation for that prohibition. Member States shall decide on the appropriate form of such compensation.
7.   Member States shall ensure that members of staff and members of a competent authority’s governance body are subject to a declaration of interest. That declaration shall include information on the members’ holdings in the form of stocks, equities, bonds, mutual funds, investment funds, mixed-type funds, hedge funds and exchange-traded funds, that may raise conflict of interest concerns. The persons concerned shall submit the declaration of interest prior to their appointment and subsequently on an annual basis.
The declaration of interest shall be without prejudice to any requirement to submit a wealth declaration under applicable national rules.
8.   Where a member of staff or a member of a competent authority’s governance body owns, at the time of being hired or appointed or at any time thereafter, financial instruments that may give rise to conflicts of interest, the competent authority shall have the power to require on a case-by-case basis that those instruments be sold or disposed of within a reasonable timeframe. Competent authorities shall also have the power to allow, on a case-by-case basis, those members to sell or dispose of financial instruments that they owned at the time of being hired or appointed.
9.   To ensure a proportionate application of this Article, EBA shall, by 10 July 2026 issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, addressed to the competent authorities, on the prevention of conflicts of interest in, and on the independence of, competent authorities, taking into account international best practices.

ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A MATERIAL HOLDING

Article 27a
Notification and assessment of the acquisition
1.   Member States shall require institutions, and financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies within the scope of Article 21a(1) (the “proposed acquirer”) to notify their competent authority in writing in advance where they intend to acquire, directly or indirectly, a material holding (the “proposed acquisition”). The notification shall indicate the size of the proposed acquisition and the relevant information, as specified in Article 27b(5).
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, a holding shall be deemed material where it is equal to or more than 15 % of the eligible capital of the proposed acquirer.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, where the proposed acquirer is an institution, the threshold referred to in paragraph 2 shall apply on both an individual basis and on the basis of the consolidated situation of the group. Where the threshold referred to in paragraph 2 is only exceeded on an individual basis, the proposed acquirer shall notify the competent authority in the Member State where it is established. That competent authority shall assess the proposed acquisition. Where that threshold is exceeded on an individual basis and on the basis of the consolidated situation of the group, the proposed acquirer shall also notify the consolidating supervisor. That consolidating supervisor shall also assess the proposed acquisition.
4.   Where the proposed acquirer is a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company within the scope of Article 21a(1), the threshold referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply on the basis of the consolidated situation, and the consolidating supervisor shall be the competent authority for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article.
5.   The competent authority shall acknowledge, in writing, the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 1 or of any additional information in accordance with paragraph 9 promptly and in any event within 10 working days following receipt of the notification or of the additional information.
6.   The competent authority shall have 60 working days from the date of the written acknowledgement of receipt of the notification and from the receipt of all documents, including those required by the Member State to be attached to the notification in accordance with Article 27b(5) (the “assessment period”), to carry out the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1).
Where the proposed acquisition concerns a qualifying holding in a credit institution as referred to in Article 22(1), the proposed acquirer shall also be subject to the notification requirement and the assessment under that Article. In that event, the time for the competent authority to carry out both the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1) and that referred to in Article 22(2) shall expire only when the later of the two relevant assessment periods expires.
7.   Where the proposed acquisition of a material holding is conducted between entities of the same group as referred to in Article 113(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or between entities within the same institutional protection scheme as referred to in Article 113(7) of that Regulation, the competent authority shall not be required to carry out the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1) of this Directive.
8.   The competent authority shall inform the proposed acquirer of the date of the expiry of the assessment period at the time of acknowledging receipt as referred to in paragraph 5.
9.   The competent authority may, during the assessment period, where necessary, and in any event no later than on the 50th working day of the assessment period, request additional information that is necessary to complete the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1). Such a request shall be made in writing and shall specify the additional information needed.
10.   The assessment period shall be suspended between the date of request for additional information by the competent authority and the date of receipt of a response thereto by the proposed acquirer, providing all the requested information. That suspension shall not exceed 20 working days. Any further requests by the competent authority for completion or clarification of the information provided shall be at its discretion but shall not result in a suspension of the assessment period.
11.   The competent authority may extend the suspension referred to in paragraph 10 to a maximum of 30 working days in the following situations:
(a)
where the entity being acquired is situated in, or is subject to the regulatory framework of, a third country;
(b)
where an exchange of information with authorities responsible for supervising the proposed acquirer in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 is necessary to carry out the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1) of this Directive.
12.   Where the approval of a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company within the scope of Article 21a(1) takes place concurrently with the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1), the competent authority for the purposes of Article 21a(1) shall coordinate, as appropriate, with the consolidating supervisor and, where different, the competent authority in the Member State where the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company is established. In that case, the assessment period shall be suspended until the procedure set out in Article 21a is complete.
13.   Where the competent authority decides to oppose the proposed acquisition, it shall, within two working days of completion of the assessment provided for in Article 27b(1), and before the end of the assessment period, inform the proposed acquirer in writing, providing the reasons for its opposition.
14.   Where the competent authority does not oppose the proposed acquisition within the assessment period in writing, it shall be deemed approved.

(a)
whether the proposed acquirer will be able to comply and continue to comply with the prudential requirements set out in this Directive and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and where applicable, other Union legal acts;
(b)
whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that, in connection with the proposed acquisition, money laundering or terrorist financing within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 is being or has been committed or attempted, or that the proposed acquisition could increase the risk thereof.
2.   For the purpose of assessing the criterion set out in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article, the competent authority shall consult, in the context of its verifications, the authorities responsible for supervising the proposed acquirer in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849.

For the purposes of this paragraph and with regard to the criterion set out in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article, a negative opinion by the authorities responsible for supervising the proposed acquirer in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849, received by the competent authorities within 30 working days of the initial request, shall be duly taken into consideration by the competent authorities when assessing the proposed acquisition and may constitute a reasonable ground for opposition.

5.   Member States shall publish a list of the information required to carry out the assessment. The proposed acquirer shall provide that information to the competent authority at the time of the notification referred to in Article 27a(1). The information required shall be proportionate and appropriate to the nature of the proposed acquisition. Member States shall not require information that is not relevant for the prudential assessment under this Article.
6.   Without prejudice to Article 27a(5) to (11), where two or more proposals to acquire material holdings in the same entity have been notified, the competent authority shall treat the proposed acquirers in a non-discriminatory manner.
7.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:
(a)
the list of minimum information to be provided by the proposed acquirer to the competent authority at the time of the notification referred to in Article 27a(1), Article 27f(1) and Article 27i(1);

The competent authority shall also forward its assessment to the consolidating supervisor.
Where the proposed acquirer is a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company within the scope of Article 21a(1), the consolidating supervisor assessing the proposed acquisition shall notify the competent authority in the Member State where the proposed acquirer is established of the proposed acquisition within 10 working days following receipt of the notification by the proposed acquirer, if that competent authority is different from the consolidating supervisor.

3.   Where the assessment of the proposed acquisition needs to be carried out by the consolidating supervisor referred to in Article 27a(3) and the consolidating supervisor is different from the competent authority in the Member State where the proposed acquirer is established, the two authorities shall work together in full consultation. The consolidating supervisor shall prepare an assessment on the proposed acquisition and shall forward that assessment to the competent authority in the Member State where the proposed acquirer is established.
