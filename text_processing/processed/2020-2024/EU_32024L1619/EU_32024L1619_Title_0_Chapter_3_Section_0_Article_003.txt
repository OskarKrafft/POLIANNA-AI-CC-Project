Classification of third-country branches
1.   Member States shall classify third-country branches as class 1 where those branches meet any of the following conditions:
(a)
the total value of the assets booked or originated by the third-country branch in the Member State is equal to or greater than EUR 5 billion, as reported for the immediately preceding annual reporting period in accordance with Section II, Sub-Section 4;

(c)
the third-country branch is not a qualifying third-country branch within the meaning of Article 48b.

3.   As part of the assessment referred to in paragraph 2, the competent authority or, where appropriate, the designated authority shall consult EBA and competent authorities of the Member States where the relevant third-country group has established other third-country branches or subsidiary institutions, in order to assess the financial stability risks that the relevant third-country branch poses for the Member States other than the Member State where it is established.
The competent authority or, where appropriate, the designated authority shall provide its reasoned assessment of the systemic importance of the third-country branch for the Union or the Member State where it is established to EBA and to the competent authorities of the Member States where the relevant third-country group has established other third-country branches or subsidiary institutions.
Where the competent authorities which are consulted disagree with the assessment of the systemic importance of the third-country branch, they shall inform the competent authority which has conducted the assessment referred to in paragraph 2 within 10 working days from receiving the assessment. The competent authorities, with the assistance of EBA, shall use their best endeavours to reach a consensus on the assessment and, where applicable, on the targeted requirements referred to in paragraph 4 no later than three months from the date on which the competent authority or, where appropriate, the designated authority raised its objection. After that period has expired, the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the third-country branch under assessment shall decide on the assessment of the systemic importance of the third-country branch and on the targeted requirements referred to in paragraph 4.

requiring that the relevant third-country branch restructure its assets or activities in such a manner that it ceases to qualify as having systemic importance in accordance with paragraph 2 or that it ceases to pose an undue risk to the financial stability of the Union or the Member States where it is established; or
(b)
imposing additional prudential requirements on the relevant third-country branch.
Where the competent authority or, where appropriate, the designated authority, considers that a third-country branch has systemic importance, but it decides not to exercise any of the powers referred to in in the first subparagraph, point (a), of this paragraph or in Article 48i, it shall provide a reasoned notification to EBA and to the competent authorities of the Member States where the relevant third-country group has established other third-country branches or subsidiary institutions as to why it has decided not to exercise those powers.
5.   By 31 December 2028, EBA shall report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission, on:
(a)
the assessment referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, in particular as regards the identification of third-country branches of the same head undertaking and the functioning of the consultation process laid down in that paragraph;

4.   Where a review, in particular of the governance arrangements, the business model, or the activities of the third-country branch, gives competent authorities reasonable grounds to suspect that, in connection with that third-country branch, money laundering or terrorist financing within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 is being or has been committed or attempted, or that there is increased risk thereof, the competent authority shall immediately notify EBA and the authority that is responsible for supervising the third-country branch in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849. Where there is an increased risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, the competent authority and the authority that is responsible for supervising the third-country branch in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 shall liaise and notify their common assessment immediately to EBA. The competent authority shall take, as appropriate, measures in accordance with this Directive, which may include withdrawing the third-country branch’s authorisation under Article 48d(2), point (g), of this Directive.

EBA may assist the competent authorities and the authorities responsible for supervising the third-country branch in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/849 in the event of a disagreement concerning the coordination of supervisory activities under this Article on its own initiative. In such an event, EBA shall act in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
