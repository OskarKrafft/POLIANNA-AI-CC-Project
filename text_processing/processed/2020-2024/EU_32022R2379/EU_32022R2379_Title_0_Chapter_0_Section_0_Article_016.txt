Article 16
Derogations
1.   Where the application of this Regulation or of the implementing measures and delegated acts adopted pursuant to it necessitates major adaptations of a national statistical system of a Member State, the Commission may adopt implementing acts granting derogations to the Member State concerned for a maximum duration of three years. No derogation shall be granted from the transitional rules for the detailed topic of use of plant protection products in agriculture referred to in Article 14(1).
The relevant Member State shall submit a duly reasoned request for such a derogation to the Commission within three months of the date of the entry into force of the act concerned, explaining what major adaptations of the national statistical system are needed and providing an estimated timeline for such adaptations.
The impact of derogations granted under this Article on the comparability of Member States’ data or on the calculation of the required timely and representative European aggregates shall be kept to a minimum. The burden on respondents and Member States shall be taken into account by the Commission when granting the derogation.
2.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 19(2).
