Article 7
Transmission frequency of the data sets
1.   The transmission frequency of the data sets shall be as set out in the Annex. The Commission may adopt implementing acts to further specify each transmission frequency.
2.   A Member State may be exempted from sending specific data with the transmission frequencies set out in the Annex for predefined variables in the event that the impact of that Member State on the EU total of those variables is limited.
The Commission may adopt implementing acts setting out the deadlines for transmitting the data and the transmission frequencies concerned, the variables and the relevant thresholds on the basis of which the first subparagraph may be applied. Those thresholds shall be set out in such a way that their application does not reduce the information on the expected EU total of the corresponding variable by more than 5 %. The thresholds shall be revised by the Commission (Eurostat) so that they correspond to the trends of EU totals.
3.   For production statistics, a Member State may be exempted from transmissions of specific data for predefined variables in the event that the impact of the variable is limited in relation to the agricultural production at national or regional level. The Commission may adopt implementing acts setting out thresholds for those variables.
4.   The implementing acts referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 19(2) at least 12 months before the beginning of the relevant reference year.
