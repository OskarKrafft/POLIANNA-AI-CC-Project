Article 18
Recovery and resilience plan
1.   A Member State wishing to receive a financial contribution in accordance with Article 12 shall submit to the Commission a recovery and resilience plan as defined in Article 17(1).
2.   After the Commission makes available for allocation the amount referred to in Article 12(3), a Member State may update and submit the recovery and resilience plan referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to take into account the updated maximum financial contribution calculated in accordance with Article 11(2).
3.   The recovery and resilience plan presented by the Member State may be submitted in a single integrated document together with the National Reform Programme and shall be officially submitted, as a rule, by 30 April. A draft recovery and resilience plan may be submitted by Member States from 15 October of the preceding year.
4.   The recovery and resilience plan shall be duly reasoned and substantiated. It shall in particular set out the following elements:
(a)
an explanation of how the recovery and resilience plan, taking into account the measures included therein, represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to the economic and social situation of the Member State, thereby contributing appropriately to all pillars referred to in Article 3, taking into account the specific challenges of the Member State concerned;
(b)
an explanation of how the recovery and resilience plan contributes to effectively address all or a significant subset of challenges identified in the relevant country-specific recommendations, including fiscal aspects thereof and recommendations made pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 where appropriate, addressed to the Member State concerned, or challenges identified in other relevant documents officially adopted by the Commission in the context of the European Semester;
(c)
a detailed explanation of how the recovery and resilience plan strengthens the growth potential, job creation and economic, social and institutional resilience of the Member State concerned, including through the promotion of policies for children and the youth, and mitigates the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis, contributing to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and thereby enhancing the economic, social and territorial cohesion and convergence within the Union;
(d)
an explanation of how the recovery and resilience plan ensures that no measure for the implementation of reforms and investments included in the recovery and resilience plan does significant harm to environmental objectives within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the principle of ‘do no significant harm’);
(e)
a qualitative explanation of how the measures in the recovery and resilience plan are expected to contribute to the green transition, including biodiversity, or to addressing the challenges resulting therefrom, and whether they account for an amount that represents at least 37 % of the recovery and resilience plan’s total allocation, based on the methodology for climate tracking set out in Annex VI; that methodology shall be used accordingly for measures that cannot be directly assigned to an intervention field listed in Annex VI; the coefficients for support for the climate objectives may be increased up to a total amount of 3 % of the allocation of the recovery and resilience plan for individual investments to take account of accompanying reform measures that credibly increase their impact on the climate objectives as explained in the recovery and resilience plan;
(f)
an explanation of how the measures in the recovery and resilience plan are expected to contribute to the digital transition or to the challenges resulting therefrom, and whether they account for an amount which represents at least 20 % of the recovery and resilience plan’s total allocation, based on the methodology for digital tagging set out in Annex VII; that methodology shall be used accordingly for measures that cannot be directly assigned to an intervention field listed in Annex VII; the coefficients for support for the digital objectives may be increased for individual investments to take account of accompanying reform measures that increase their impact on the digital objectives;
(g)
where appropriate, for investments in digital capacities and connectivity, a security self-assessment based on common objective criteria identifying any security issues, and detailing how those issues will be addressed in order to comply with relevant Union and national law;
(h)
an indication of whether the measures included in the recovery and resilience plan comprise cross-border or multi-country projects;
(i)
envisaged milestones, targets and an indicative timetable for the implementation of the reforms, and investments to be completed by 31 August 2026;
(j)
the envisaged investment projects and the related investment period;
(k)
the estimated total costs of the reforms and investments covered by the recovery and resilience plan submitted (also referred to as ‘estimated total costs of the recovery and resilience plan’) backed up by appropriate justification and by explanations of how it is in line with the principle of cost efficiency and commensurate to the expected national economic and social impact;
(l)
where relevant, information on existing or planned Union financing;
(m)
the accompanying measures that may be needed;
(n)
a justification of the coherence of the recovery and resilience plan; and an explanation of its consistency with the principles, plans and programmes referred to in Article 17;
(o)
an explanation of how the measures in the recovery and resilience plan are expected to contribute to gender equality and equal opportunities for all and the mainstreaming of those objectives, in line with principles 2 and 3 of the European Pillar of Social Rights, with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 and, where relevant, with the national gender equality strategy;
(p)
the arrangements for the effective monitoring and implementation of the recovery and resilience plan by the Member State concerned, including the proposed milestones and targets, and the related indicators;
(q)
for the preparation and, where available, for the implementation of the recovery and resilience plan, a summary of the consultation process, conducted in accordance with the national legal framework, of local and regional authorities, social partners, civil society organisations, youth organisations and other relevant stakeholders, and how the input of the stakeholders is reflected in the recovery and resilience plan;
(r)
an explanation of the Member State’s system to prevent, detect and correct corruption, fraud and conflicts of interests, when using the funds provided under the Facility, and the arrangements that aim to avoid double funding from the Facility and other Union programmes;
(s)
where appropriate, the request for loan support and the additional milestones as referred to in Article 14(2) and (3) and the elements thereof; and
(t)
any other relevant information.
5.   When preparing their recovery and resilience plans, Member States may request the Commission to organise an exchange of good practices in order to allow the requesting Member States to benefit from the experience of other Member States. Member States may also request technical support under the Technical Support Instrument. Member States shall be encouraged to foster synergies with recovery and resilience plans of other Member States.
