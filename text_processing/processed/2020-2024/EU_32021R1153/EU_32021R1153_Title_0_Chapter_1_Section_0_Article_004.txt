The Commission shall do its utmost to enable Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund to attain, by the end of the period 2021-2027, the highest possible absorption of the amount transferred to the CEF, including through the organisation of additional calls.

The Commission shall implement those resources directly in accordance with Article 62(1), first subparagraph, point (a), of the Financial Regulation or indirectly in accordance with point (c) of that subparagraph. Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned.
14.   Without prejudice to paragraph 13 of this Article, in the digital sector, resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at the request of those Member States, be transferred to the CEF, including for the purpose of complementing the funding of eligible actions under Article 9(4) of this Regulation, up to 100 % of the total eligible cost, without prejudice to the co-financing principle laid down in Article 190 of the Financial Regulation and to the State Aid Rules.
