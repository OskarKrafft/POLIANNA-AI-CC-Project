Article 22
Monitoring and reporting
1.   Indicators to report on the progress of the CEF towards the achievement of the general and specific objectives laid down in Article 3 are set out in Part I of the Annex.
2.   To ensure effective assessment of the CEF’s progress towards the achievement of its objectives, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 26, to amend Part I of the Annex with regard to the indicators where considered necessary as well as to supplement this Regulation with provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework.
3.   The performance reporting system shall ensure that data for monitoring the implementation and the results of the CEF are suitable for an in-depth analysis of the progress achieved, including for climate tracking, and that they are collected efficiently, effectively and in a timely manner. To that end, proportionate reporting requirements shall be imposed on recipients of Union funds and, where appropriate, on Member States.
4.   The Commission shall improve the dedicated internet site, by publishing, in real time, a map with the projects that are being implemented, together with relevant information, including impact assessments and the value, beneficiary, implementing entity and state of play of the project. The Commission shall also present progress reports every two years. Those progress reports shall include the information on the implementation of the CEF, in accordance with the general and specific objectives laid down in Article 3, clarifying whether the different sectors are on track, whether the total budgetary commitment is in line with the total amount allocated, whether the on-going projects are sufficiently complete, and whether it is still feasible and appropriate to deliver them.
