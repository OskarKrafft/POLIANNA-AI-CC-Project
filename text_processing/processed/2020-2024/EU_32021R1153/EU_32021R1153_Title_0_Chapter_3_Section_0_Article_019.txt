Article 19
Cumulative and alternative funding
1.   An action that has received a contribution under the CEF may also receive a contribution from another Union programme, including funds under shared management, provided that the contributions do not cover the same costs. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution to the action. The cumulative funding shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action. The support from the different Union programmes may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.
2.   The Seal of Excellence label shall be awarded to actions which comply with the following cumulative conditions:
(a)
they have been assessed in a call for proposals under the CEF;
(b)
they comply with the minimum quality requirements of that call for proposals;
(c)
they cannot be financed under that call for proposals due to budgetary constraints.
It shall be possible for actions that have been awarded a Seal of Excellence label in accordance with the first subparagraph to receive support from the ERDF in accordance with Article 67(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 or from the Cohesion Fund, without any further assessment, and provided that such actions are consistent with the objectives and rules of the Fund concerned.
