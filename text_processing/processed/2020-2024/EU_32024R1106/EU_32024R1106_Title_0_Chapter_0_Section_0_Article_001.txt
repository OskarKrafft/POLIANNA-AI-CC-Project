Authorisation and supervision of inside information platforms
1.   An IIP shall operate only after the Agency has assessed whether that IIP complies with the requirements set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 and has authorised its operation. The Agency shall establish a register of IIPs which it has authorised pursuant to this paragraph. The register of IIPs shall be publicly available and shall contain information on the services for which the IIP is authorised. The Agency shall regularly review the compliance of IIPs with paragraphs 3, 4 and 5.
2.   IIPs registered by the Agency pursuant to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1348/2014 (*8) and included in the Agency’s list of IIPs shall be allowed to continue operating until the Agency has taken a decision on authorisation pursuant to this Article.
3.   An IIP shall have adequate policies and arrangements in place to make public the inside information as required under Article 4(1) as close to real time as is technically possible, on a reasonable commercial basis. The inside information shall be made available and easily accessible for all purposes free of charge, including through a website or an application programming interface. The IIP shall efficiently and consistently disseminate such information in a manner that ensures prompt access to the inside information, on a non-discriminatory basis and in a manner that facilitates the consolidation of the inside information with similar data from other sources.
4.   The inside information that is made public by an IIP pursuant to paragraph 3 shall include at least the following details, depending on the type of inside information:
(a)
the message ID and the event status;
(b)
the date and time of the publication and the date and time of the beginning and the end of the event;
(c)

(d)
the bidding or balancing zone concerned;
(e)
the type of information, such as unavailability, forecast and actual use; and

where the installed or technical capacity is unavailable, the reason for the unavailability;
(v)
the type of fuel;
(vi)
the affected asset or unit and its identification code.
5.   An IIP shall operate and maintain effective administrative arrangements designed to prevent conflicts of interest with its clients. In particular, an IIP who is also an OMP or market participant shall treat all inside information collected in a non-discriminatory manner and shall operate and maintain appropriate arrangements to separate different business functions.
An IIP shall have sound security mechanisms in place designed to guarantee the security of the means of transfer of inside information, to minimise the risk of data corruption and unauthorised access and to prevent inside information leakage before publication. The IIP shall maintain adequate resources and shall have back-up facilities in place in order to offer and maintain its services.
The IIP shall have mechanisms in place allowing inside information reports to be quickly and effectively checked with regard to their completeness, to identify omissions and obvious errors, and to request receipt of a corrected version of such reports.
6.   Where the Agency finds that an IIP has infringed any of the requirements laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article, it shall, before withdrawing an authorisation pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article, afford the IIP the appropriate procedural safeguards, including those referred to in Article 14(6), (7) and (8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/942.
7.   The Agency may withdraw the authorisation of an IIP by means of a decision and remove it from the register where the IIP:
(a)
does not make use of the authorisation within 12 months of the date on which the authorisation was issued, expressly renounces the authorisation or has provided no services in the preceding six months;
(b)
obtained the authorisation by making false statements or by any other irregular means;
(c)
no longer meets the requirements for authorisation set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5;
(d)
did not bring the infringement to an end; or
(e)
has seriously and systematically infringed this Regulation.
In the case of a decision as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the Agency shall indicate the legal remedies available pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) 2019/942.
An IIP whose authorisation has been withdrawn by the Agency shall inform all relevant market participants and shall ensure orderly substitution including the transfer of data to other IIPs, chosen by market participants, and the redirection of reporting flows to other IIPs. The Agency shall set a reasonable period of at least six months to ensure such orderly substitution. During that period the IIP shall ensure continuity of the services that it provides. The Agency may, however, set a shorter period if the continued operation of the IIP could jeopardise the orderly operation of the system, having regard to the seriousness of the facts leading to the withdrawal of the authorisation.
The Agency shall, without undue delay, notify the national regulatory authority in the Member State where the IIP is established of any decision to withdraw the authorisation of an IIP pursuant to the first subparagraph and shall inform the market participants thereof.
8.   By 8 May 2025, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 20 to supplement this Regulation by specifying:
(a)
the means by which an IIP is to fulfil the obligation to make public the inside information laid down in paragraph 3 of this Article;

the RRM is established in the Union; and
(b)
the RRM meets the requirements laid down in paragraph 3.
The Agency shall authorise an entity to operate as an RRM within a reasonable period of time and, to the extent possible, within three months of the receipt of the complete application. The authorisation shall be effective and valid for the entire territory of the Union, and shall allow the RRM to provide the services for which it has been authorised throughout the Union.
RRMs registered by the Agency pursuant to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1348/2014 and included in the Agency’s list of RRMs shall be allowed to continue operating until the Agency has taken a decision on authorisation pursuant to this Article.
An authorised RRM shall comply with the conditions for authorisation referred to in this paragraph and in paragraph 3. An authorised RRM shall, without undue delay, notify the Agency of any material changes to the conditions for authorisation.
The Agency shall establish a register of RRMs which it has authorised pursuant to this paragraph. The register shall be publicly available and shall contain information on the services for which the RRM is authorised. The register shall be updated on a regular basis.
2.   The Agency shall regularly review the compliance of RRMs with paragraphs 1 and 3. For that purpose, RRMs shall report on an annual basis about their activities to the Agency.
3.   RRMs shall have adequate policies and arrangements in place to ensure the prompt reporting of information as required under Article 8.
RRMs shall operate and maintain effective administrative arrangements designed to prevent conflicts of interest with their clients. In particular, an RRM that is also an OMP or market participant shall treat all information collected in a non-discriminatory manner and shall operate and maintain appropriate arrangements to separate different business functions.
RRMs shall have sound security mechanisms in place designed to guarantee the security and authentication of the means of transfer of information, minimise the risk of data corruption and unauthorised access and to prevent information leakage, maintaining the confidentiality of the data at all times. RRMs shall maintain adequate resources and shall have back-up facilities in place in order to offer and maintain their services.
RRMs shall have mechanisms in place allowing transaction reports to be effectively checked with regard to their completeness, to identify omissions and obvious errors caused by the market participant, and where such error or omission occurs, to communicate details of the error or omission to the market participant and to request receipt of a corrected version of such reports.
RRMs shall have systems in place to enable them to detect errors or omissions caused by them and to enable them to correct and transmit, or re-transmit as the case may be, correct and complete transaction reports to the Agency.
4.   Where the Agency finds that an RRM has infringed paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this Article, it shall, before withdrawing an authorisation pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article, afford the RRM the appropriate procedural safeguards, including those referred to in Article 14(6), (7) and (8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/942.
5.   The Agency may withdraw the authorisation of an RRM by means of a decision and remove it from the register where the RRM:
(a)
does not make use of the authorisation within 18 months of the date on which the authorisation was issued, expressly renounces the authorisation or has provided no services in the preceding 18 months;
(b)
obtained the authorisation by making false statements or by any other irregular means;
(c)
no longer meets the requirements for authorisation set out in paragraphs 1 and 3; or
(d)
has seriously and systematically infringed this Regulation.

An RRM whose authorisation has been withdrawn by the Agency shall inform all relevant market participants and shall ensure orderly substitution including the transfer of data to other RRMs, chosen by market participants, and the redirection of reporting flows to other RRMs. The Agency shall set a reasonable period of at least six months to ensure such orderly substitution. During that period, the RRM shall ensure continuity of the services that it provides. The Agency may, however, provide a shorter period if the continued operation of the RRM could jeopardise the orderly operation of the system, having regard to the seriousness of the facts leading to the withdrawal of the authorisation.
The Agency shall, without undue delay, notify the national regulatory authority in the Member State where the RRM is established of any decision to withdraw the authorisation of an RRM pursuant to the first subparagraph and shall inform the market participants thereof.
6.   By 8 May 2025, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 20 to supplement this Regulation by specifying:
