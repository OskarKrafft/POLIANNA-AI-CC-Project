(iii)
information on when, where and by whom the product was sold, if available;
(c)
a clear description of the hazard associated with the recalled product, avoiding any elements that may decrease consumers’ perception of risk, such as by using terms and expressions such as ‘voluntary’, ‘precautionary’, ‘discretionary’, ‘in rare situations’ or ‘in specific situations’ or by indicating that there have been no reported accidents;
(d)
a clear description of the action consumers should take, including an instruction to immediately stop using the recalled product;

3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, set out the template for a recall notice, taking into account scientific and market developments. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 46(2). That template shall be made available by the Commission in a format that enables economic operators to easily create a recall notice, including in accessible formats for persons with disabilities.
