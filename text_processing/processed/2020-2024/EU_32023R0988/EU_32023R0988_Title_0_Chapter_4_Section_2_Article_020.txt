Specific obligations of providers of online marketplaces related to product safety
1.   Without prejudice to the general obligations provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, providers of online marketplaces shall designate a single point of contact allowing for direct communication, by electronic means, with Member States’ market surveillance authorities in relation to product safety issues, in particular for the purpose of notifying orders issued pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.
Providers of online marketplaces shall register with the Safety Gate Portal and shall indicate on the Safety Gate Portal the information concerning their single contact point.
2.   Without prejudice to the general obligations provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, providers of online marketplaces shall designate a single point of contact to enable consumers to communicate directly and rapidly with them in relation to product safety issues.
3.   Providers of online marketplaces shall ensure that they have internal processes for product safety in place in order to comply without undue delay with the relevant requirements of this Regulation.
4.   As regards powers conferred by Member States in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, Member States shall confer on their market surveillance authorities the necessary power, as regards specific content referring to an offer of a dangerous product, to issue an order requiring the providers of online marketplaces to remove such content from their online interface, to disable access to it or to display an explicit warning. Such orders shall be issued in accordance with the minimum conditions set out in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.
Providers of online marketplaces shall take the necessary measures to receive and process orders issued pursuant to this paragraph and they shall act without undue delay, and in any event within two working days from receipt of the order. They shall inform the issuing market surveillance authority of the effect given to the order by electronic means using the contact details of the market surveillance authority published in the Safety Gate Portal.
5.   Orders issued pursuant to paragraph 4 may require the provider of an online marketplace, for the prescribed period, to remove from its online interface all identical content referring to an offer of the dangerous product in question, to disable access to it or to display an explicit warning, provided that the search for the content concerned is limited to the information identified in the order and does not require the provider of an online marketplace to carry out an independent assessment of that content, and that the search and the removal can be carried out in a proportionate manner by reliable automated tools.
6.   Providers of online marketplaces shall take into account regular information on dangerous products notified by the market surveillance authorities in line with Article 26, received through the Safety Gate Portal, for the purpose of applying their voluntary measures aimed at detecting, identifying, removing or disabling access to the content referring to offers of dangerous products on their online marketplace, where applicable, including by making use of the interoperable interface to the Safety Gate Portal in accordance with Article 34. They shall inform the authority that made the notification to the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System of any action taken by using the contact details of the market surveillance authority published in the Safety Gate Portal.
7.   For the purpose of compliance with Article 31(3) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, as regards product safety, providers of online marketplaces shall use at least the Safety Gate Portal.
8.   Providers of online marketplaces shall, without undue delay and in any event within three working days from the receipt of the notice, process the notices related to product safety issues with regard to the product offered for sale online through their services, received in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.
9.   For the purpose of compliance with the requirements of Article 31(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 as regards product safety information, providers of online marketplaces shall design and organise their online interface in a way that enables traders offering the product to provide at least the following information for each product offered and that ensures that the information is displayed or otherwise made easily accessible by consumers on the product listing:
(a)
name, registered trade name or registered trade mark of the manufacturer, as well as the postal and electronic address at which the manufacturer can be contacted;
(b)
where the manufacturer is not established in the Union, the name, postal and electronic address of the responsible person within the meaning of Article 16(1) of this Regulation or Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020;
(c)
information allowing the identification of the product, including a picture of it, its type and any other product identifier; and
(d)
any warning or safety information to be affixed on the product or to accompany it in accordance with this Regulation or the applicable Union harmonisation legislation in a language which can be easily understood by consumers as determined by the Member State in which the product is made available on the market.
10.   The internal processes referred to in paragraph 3 shall include mechanisms which enable traders to provide:
(a)
information in accordance with paragraph 9 of this Article including information on the manufacturer established in the Union or, where applicable, the responsible person within the meaning of Article 16(1) of this Regulation or Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020; and
(b)
their self-certification committing to offer only products that comply with this Regulation and additional identification information, in accordance with Article 30(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, where applicable.
11.   For the purpose of compliance with Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 regarding product safety, providers of online marketplaces shall suspend, for a reasonable period of time and after having issued a prior warning, the provision of their services to traders that frequently offer products which are non-compliant with this Regulation.
12.   Providers of online marketplaces shall cooperate with the market surveillance authorities, with traders and with relevant economic operators to facilitate any action taken to eliminate or, if that is not possible, to mitigate the risks presented by a product that is or was offered online through their services.
In particular, providers of online marketplaces shall:
(a)
ensure that they provide appropriate and timely information to consumers including by:
(i)
directly notifying all affected consumers who bought through their interfaces the relevant product in the event of a product safety recall of which they have actual knowledge or where certain information has to be brought to the attention of consumers to ensure the safe use of a product (the ‘safety warning’) in accordance with Article 35 or 36, or both;
(ii)
publishing information on product safety recalls on their online interfaces;
(b)
inform the relevant economic operator of the decision to remove or disable access to the content referring to an offer of a dangerous product;

immediately inform, through the Safety Business Gateway, the market surveillance authorities of the Member States in which the relevant product has been made available on the market about dangerous products that were offered on their online interfaces, of which they have actual knowledge, by providing the appropriate details available to them of the risk to the health and safety of consumers, of the quantity by Member State of products still circulating on the market, if available, and of any corrective measure that, to their knowledge, has already been taken;
(e)
cooperate with regard to accidents notified to them, including by:
(i)
informing the relevant traders and economic operators without delay about the information they have received regarding accidents or safety issues, where they have knowledge that the product in question was offered by those traders through their interfaces;
(ii)
notifying without undue delay through the Safety Business Gateway of any accident, of which they have been informed, resulting in a serious risk or actual damage to the health or safety of a consumer, caused by a product made available on their online marketplace and inform the manufacturer thereof;
(f)
cooperate with law enforcement agencies at Union and national level, including the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), through regular and structured exchange of information on offers that have been removed on the basis of this Article by providers of online marketplaces;
(g)
allow access to their interfaces for the online tools operated by market surveillance authorities to identify dangerous products;
(h)
cooperate in identifying, as far as possible, the supply chain of dangerous products by responding to data requests where the relevant information is not publicly available;
(i)
upon a reasoned request of the market surveillance authorities, when providers of online marketplaces or online sellers have put in place technical obstacles to the extraction of data from their online interfaces (data scraping), allow the scraping of such data only for product safety purposes based on the identification parameters provided by the requesting market surveillance authorities.
