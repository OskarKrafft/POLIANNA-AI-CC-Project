Article 110
Register of non-compliant entities providing crypto-asset services
1.   ESMA shall establish a non-exhaustive register of entities that provide crypto-asset services in violation of Article 59 or 61.
2.   The register shall contain at least the commercial name or the website of a non-compliant entity and the name of the competent authority that submitted the information.
3.   The register shall be publicly available on ESMA’s website in a machine-readable format and shall be updated on a regular basis to take into account any changes of circumstances or any information that is brought to ESMA’s attention concerning the registered non-compliant entities. The register shall enable centralised access to information submitted by competent authorities from the Member States or third countries, as well as by EBA.
4.   ESMA shall update the register to include information on any case of infringement of this Regulation identified on its own initiative in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 in which it has adopted a decision under paragraph 6 of that Article addressed to a non-compliant entity providing crypto-asset services, or any information on entities providing crypto-asset services without the necessary authorisation or registration submitted by the relevant supervisory authorities of third countries.
5.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, ESMA may apply the relevant supervisory and investigative powers of competent authorities as referred to in Article 94(1) to non-compliant entities providing crypto-asset services.
