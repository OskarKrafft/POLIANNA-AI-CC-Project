Complaints shall be accepted in writing, including electronically, and in an official language of the Member State in which the complaint is submitted, or in a language accepted by the competent authorities of that Member State.
2.   Information on the complaints-handling procedures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made available on the website of each competent authority and communicated to EBA and ESMA.
