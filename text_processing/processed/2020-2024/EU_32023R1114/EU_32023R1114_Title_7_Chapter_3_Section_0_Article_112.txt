(e)
the importance of the profits gained or losses avoided by the natural or legal person responsible for the infringement, insofar as those can be determined;
(f)
the losses for third parties caused by the infringement, insofar as those can be determined;
(g)
the level of cooperation of the natural or legal person responsible for the infringement with the competent authority, without prejudice to the need to ensure disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided by that person;

previous infringements of this Regulation by the natural or legal person responsible for the infringement;
(i)

They shall coordinate their action in order to avoid duplication and overlaps when exercising their supervisory and investigative powers and when imposing administrative penalties and other administrative measures in cross-border cases.
