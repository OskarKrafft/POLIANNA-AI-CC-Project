The Commission shall enter into consultations or cooperate with any third country affected by the same or similar economic coercion or with any other interested third country, with a view to obtaining the cessation of the economic coercion, after having consulted the Council, where applicable in accordance with the Treaties.
Such consultations and cooperation may involve, where appropriate:
(a)
sharing relevant information and experiences to facilitate a coherent response to such economic coercion;

coordination in relevant international fora;
(c)
coordination in the response to the economic coercion.
The Commission shall invite, where appropriate, Member States to participate in such consultations and cooperation.
Such consultations and cooperation shall not unduly delay the procedure under this Regulation.
