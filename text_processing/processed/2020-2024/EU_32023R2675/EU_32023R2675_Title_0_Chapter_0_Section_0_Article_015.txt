Confidentiality
1.   Information received pursuant to this Regulation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was supplied, requested, or obtained.
2.   A person who supplies information referred to in paragraph 1 may request such information be treated as confidential. That request shall be accompanied by a non-confidential and meaningful summary of the information concerned or a statement of the reasons explaining why the information concerned cannot be summarised.
