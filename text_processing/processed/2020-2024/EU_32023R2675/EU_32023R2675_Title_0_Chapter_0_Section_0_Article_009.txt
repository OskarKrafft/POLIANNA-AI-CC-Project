ArticleÂ 9
Determination of the Union interest
The determination of the Union interest in taking, suspending, amending or terminating Union response measures shall be based on all available information and consist of an appreciation of the various interests at stake, taken as a whole. Those interests include primarily the preservation of the ability of the Union and its Member States to make legitimate sovereign choices free from economic coercion, and all other interests of the Union or the Member States specific to the case, the interests of Union economic operators, including upstream and downstream industries, and the interests of Union final consumers affected or potentially affected by the economic coercion or by Union response measures.
