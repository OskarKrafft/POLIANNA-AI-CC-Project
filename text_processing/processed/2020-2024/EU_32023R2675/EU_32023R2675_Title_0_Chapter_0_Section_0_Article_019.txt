Reporting and review
1.   Without prejudice to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, the Commission shall keep the European Parliament and the Council informed, regularly and in a timely manner, of relevant developments in the application of this Regulation throughout the examination of third-country measures, including the start thereof, the engagement with the third country and the international cooperation, and during the period in which Union response measures are in force.
In light of the information received, the European Parliament or the Council may invite, where appropriate, the Commission for an exchange of views.
The European Parliament may express its views via any appropriate means.
2.   The Commission shall evaluate Union response measures adopted pursuant to Article 8 within 6 months after their termination, taking into account stakeholder input, information provided by the European Parliament and the Council and any other relevant information, and shall submit an evaluation report to the European Parliament and the Council.
The evaluation report shall examine the effectiveness and operation of the Union response measures, and, where appropriate, draw conclusions for the purposes of future Union response measures as well as for the review of this Regulation pursuant to paragraph 3.
3.   No later than 3 years after the adoption of the first implementing act pursuant Article 5 or by 27 December 2028, whichever is earlier, and every 5 years thereafter, the Commission shall review this Regulation and its implementation and shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council. For the purposes of that review, the Commission shall give particular consideration to any issues which could arise as regards the relationship of this Regulation to other existing Union instruments.
