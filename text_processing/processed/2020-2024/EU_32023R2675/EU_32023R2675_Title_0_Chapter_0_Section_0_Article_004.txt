1.   The Commission may, on its own initiative or upon a duly substantiated request, examine any third-country measure in order to determine whether it meets the conditions of Article 2(1).
2.   Where the Commission examines a third-country measure, it shall act expeditiously. The examination shall normally not exceed 4 months.
The Commission shall carry out the examination based on substantiated information gathered on its own initiative or received from any reliable source, including a Member State, the European Parliament, economic operators or trade unions.
The Commission shall ensure the protection of confidential information in accordance with Article 15 including, when necessary, the protection of the identity of the person who supplies the information.
The Commission shall make publicly available a secure tool with a view to facilitating the submission of information to the Commission.
3.   The Commission shall inform the Member States in a timely manner of the start of examinations and of relevant developments with regard to ongoing examinations.
4.   The Commission shall seek information about the impact of the third-country measures, where necessary.
The Commission may request Member States to supply such information and Member States shall act upon that request expeditiously.
By publishing a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union and, where appropriate, through other suitable means of public communication, the Commission may invite stakeholders to submit information. The Commission shall specify a date by which that information is to be submitted, taking into account the period indicated in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2.
If the Commission publishes such a notice, it shall notify the third country concerned that the examination has started.
