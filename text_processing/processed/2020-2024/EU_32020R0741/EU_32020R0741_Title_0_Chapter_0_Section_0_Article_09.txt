Article 9
Information and awareness-raising
Savings of water resources as a result of water reuse shall be the subject of general awareness-raising campaigns in Member States where reclaimed water is used for agricultural irrigation. Such campaigns may include the promotion of the benefits of safe water reuse.
Those Member States may also set up information campaigns for end-users to ensure the optimal and safe use of reclaimed water, thereby ensuring a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health.
Member States may adapt such information and awareness-raising campaigns to the scale of water reuse.
