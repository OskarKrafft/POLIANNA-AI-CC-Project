Validation monitoring shall be performed before a new reclamation facility is put into operation.
Reclamation facilities that are already in operation and that meet the reclaimed water quality requirements set out in Table 2 of point (a) on 25 June 2020 shall be exempted from that validation monitoring obligation.
However, validation monitoring shall be performed in all cases where equipment is upgraded, and when new equipment or processes are added.
Validation monitoring shall be performed for the reclaimed water quality class with the most stringent requirements, Class A, to assess whether the performance targets (log10 reduction) are complied with. Validation monitoring shall entail the monitoring of the indicator microorganisms associated with each group of pathogens, namely bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The indicator microorganisms selected are E. coli for pathogenic bacteria, F-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages or coliphages for pathogenic viruses, and Clostridium perfringens spores or spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria for protozoa. Performance targets (log10 reduction) for the validation monitoring for the selected indicator microorganisms are set out in Table 4 and shall be met at the point of compliance, considering the concentrations of the raw waste water entering the urban waste water treatment plant. At least 90 % of validation samples shall reach or exceed the performance targets.
If a biological indicator is not present in sufficient quantity in raw waste water to achieve the log10 reduction, the absence of such biological indicator in reclaimed water shall mean that the validation requirements are complied with. The compliance with the performance target may be established by analytical control, by addition of the performance granted to individual treatment steps based on scientific evidence for standard well-established processes, such as published data of testing reports or case studies, or tested in a laboratory under controlled conditions for innovative treatment.

Methods of analysis for monitoring shall be validated and documented in accordance with EN ISO/IEC-17025 or other national or international standards that ensure an equivalent quality.

(*1)  If the same type of irrigated crop falls under multiple categories of Table 1, the requirements of the most stringent category shall apply.

(*2)  Drip irrigation (also called trickle irrigation) is a micro-irrigation system capable of delivering water drops or tiny streams to the plants and involves dripping water onto the soil or directly under its surface at very low rates (2–20 litres/hour) from a system of small-diameter plastic pipes fitted with outlets called emitters or drippers.

(*3)  In the case of irrigation methods which imitate rain, special attention should be paid to the protection of the health of workers or bystanders. For this purpose, appropriate preventive measures shall be applied.

(*4)  The reference pathogens Campylobacter, Rotavirus and Cryptosporidium may also be used for validation monitoring purposes instead of the proposed indicator microorganisms. The following log10 reduction performance targets shall then apply: Campylobacter (≥ 5,0), Rotavirus (≥ 6,0) and Cryptosporidium (≥ 5,0).

(*5)  Total coliphages is selected as the most appropriate viral indicator. However, if analysis of total coliphages is not feasible, at least one of them (F-specific or somatic coliphages) shall be analysed.

(*6)  
            Clostridium perfringens spores is selected as the most appropriate protozoa indicator. However, spore-forming sulfate-reducing bacteria are an alternative if the concentration of Clostridium perfringens spores does not make it possible to validate the requested log10 removal.

Key elements of risk management
Risk management shall comprise identifying and managing risks in a proactive way to ensure that reclaimed water is safely used and managed and that there is no risk to the environment or to human or animal health. For those purposes, a water reuse risk management plan shall be established on the basis of the following elements:
1.
Description of the entire water reuse system, from the entry of waste water into the urban waste water treatment plant to the point of use, including the sources of waste water, the treatment steps and the technologies used at the reclamation facility, the supply, distribution and storage infrastructure, the intended use, the place and period of use (e.g. temporary or ad-hoc use), the irrigation method, the crop type, other water sources if a mix is intended to be used and the volume of reclaimed water to be supplied.
2.
Identification of all parties involved in the water reuse system and a clear description of their roles and responsibilities.
3.
Identification of potential hazards, in particular the presence of pollutants and pathogens, and the potential for hazardous events such as treatment failures or accidental leakages or contamination of the water reuse system.
4.
Identification of the environments and populations at risk, and the exposure routes to the identified potential hazards, taking into account specific environmental factors, such as local hydrogeology, topology, soil type and ecology, and factors related to the type of crops and farming and irrigation practices. Consideration of possible irreversible or long-term negative environmental and health effects of the water reclamation operation, supported by scientific evidence.
5.
Assessment of risks to the environment and to human and animal health, taking into account the nature of the identified potential hazards, the duration of the intended uses, the identified environments and populations at risk of exposure to those hazards and the severity of possible effects of the hazards considering the precautionary principle, as well as all relevant Union and national legislation, guidance documents and minimum requirements in relation to food and feed and worker safety. The risk assessment could be based on a review of available scientific studies and data.
The risk assessment shall consist of the following elements:

characterisation of the risks;
(b)
an assessment of risks to human and animal health, including all of the following:
(i)
confirmation of the nature of the hazards, including, where relevant, the dose-response relationship;
(ii)
assessment of the potential range of dose or exposure;
(iii)
characterisation of the risks.
The risk assessment may be carried out using qualitative or semi-quantitative risk assessment. Quantitative risk assessment shall be used when there are sufficient supporting data or in projects having a potential high risk for the environment or public health.
The following requirements and obligations shall, as a minimum, be taken into account in the risk assessment:
(a)
the requirement to reduce and prevent water pollution from nitrates in accordance with Directive 91/676/EEC;

(n)
the requirements regarding animal health set out in Regulations (EC) No 1069/2009 and (EU) No 142/2011.
(B)
Conditions relating to the additional requirements
6.
Consideration of requirements for water quality and monitoring that are additional to or stricter than those specified in Section 2 of Annex I, or both, when necessary and appropriate to ensure adequate protection of the environment and of human and animal health, in particular when there is clear scientific evidence that the risk originates from reclaimed water and not from other sources.
Depending on the outcome of the risk assessment referred to in point 5, such additional requirements may in particular concern:
(a)
heavy metals;
(b)
pesticides;

(C)
Preventive measures
7.
Identification of preventive measures that are already in place or that should be taken to limit risks so that all identified risks can be adequately managed. Special attention shall be paid to water bodies used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption and relevant safeguard zones.
Such preventive measures may include:
(a)
access control;
(b)
additional disinfection or pollutant removal measures;
(c)
specific irrigation technology mitigating the risk of aerosol formation (e.g. drip irrigation);
(d)
specific requirements for sprinkler irrigation (e.g. maximum wind speed, distances between sprinkler and sensitive areas);
(e)
specific requirements for agricultural fields (e.g. slope inclination, field water saturation and karstic areas);
(f)
pathogen die-off support before harvest;
(g)
establishment of minimum safety distances (e.g. from surface water, including sources for livestock, or activities such as aquaculture, fish farming, shellfish aquaculture, swimming and other aquatic activities);
