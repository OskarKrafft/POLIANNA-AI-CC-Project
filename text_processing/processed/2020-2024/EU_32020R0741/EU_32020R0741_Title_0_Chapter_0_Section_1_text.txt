Uses of reclaimed water


Agricultural irrigation

Agricultural irrigation means irrigation of the following types of crops:
—
food crops consumed raw, meaning crops which are intended for human consumption in a raw or unprocessed state;
—
processed food crops, meaning crops which are intended for human consumption after a treatment process (i.e. cooked or industrially processed);
—
non-food crops, meaning crops which are not intended for human consumption (e.g. pastures and forage, fibre, ornamental, seed, energy and turf crops).
Without prejudice to other relevant Union law in the fields of the environment and of health, Member States may use reclaimed water for further uses such as:
—
industrial water reuse; and
—
amenity-related and environmental purposes.
