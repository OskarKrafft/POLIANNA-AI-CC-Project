Article 20
Amendments to the Ukraine Plan
1.   Where the Ukraine Plan, including relevant qualitative and quantitative steps, is no longer achievable by Ukraine, either partially or totally, because of objective circumstances, the Ukrainian authorities, after consulting the Verkhovna Rada, whenever relevant, may propose amendments to the Ukraine Plan.
2.   The Commission may, in agreement with Ukraine, submit a proposal to amend the Council implementing decision referred to in Article 19(1), in particular to take into account changes in the circumstances allowing for an increase in ambition or a change of the amounts available, notably due to additional contributions by the Member States or from other sources as referred to in Article 6(4). The Council may request the Commission to assess whether the conditions set out in this paragraph are met and to submit, where appropriate, the relevant proposal.
3.   Where the Commission considers that the reasons put forward by Ukraine justify an amendment to the Ukraine Plan, the Commission shall assess the amended Ukraine Plan in accordance with Article 18 and shall submit a proposal for an amendment of the Council implementing decision referred to in Article 19(1) without undue delay. The Council shall act, as a rule, within one month of receiving the Commission’s proposal. The Council, acting by qualified majority, may amend the Commission’s proposal and adopt the amended proposal by means of an implementing decision.
