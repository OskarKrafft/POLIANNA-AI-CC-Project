Article 13
Exceptional financing
1.   In duly justified exceptional circumstances, in particular where a significant deterioration of the war makes it impossible for Ukraine to fulfil the conditions attached to the forms of support under this Regulation, the Facility may provide exceptional financing to Ukraine in order to maintain its macro-financial stability and to foster the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 3. Such exceptional financing shall be granted for individual periods of up to three months and shall cease as soon as the fulfilment of the conditions becomes possible again. Financing under this Article may be granted in addition to and during the same period of exceptional bridge financing granted under Article 25.
2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, where the Commission finds that it is impossible for Ukraine to fulfil the conditions attached to support provided under this Regulation due to such duly justified exceptional circumstances, it may submit to the Council a proposal for an implementing decision providing for exceptional financing to Ukraine under the Facility. The Council shall act, as a rule, within one month of receiving the Commission’s proposal.
3.   The exceptional financing shall be subject to the precondition set out in Article 5(1) and shall be financed within the resources referred to in Article 6(1), first subparagraph, point (a), and (2).
4.   The implementing decision referred to in paragraph 2 shall set out the audit, control, monitoring and reporting rules, as well as the conditions and modalities for the exceptional financing.
