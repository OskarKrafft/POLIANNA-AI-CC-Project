Article 32
Provisioning
1.   The provisioning rate for the Ukraine Guarantee shall initially be 70 %.
By way of derogation from Article 211(2) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 in relation to the period of time for which global provisioning shall be constituted, the provisioning shall be constituted until 31 December 2027 and be equal to the amount of provisioning corresponding to the Ukraine Guarantee granted and may be constituted gradually to reflect progress in the selection and implementation of the financing and investment operations supporting the objectives of the Facility.
2.   The provisioning rate shall be reviewed at least once a year following the entry into force of this Regulation. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of the outcome of that review.
3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 41 of this Regulation to amend the provisioning rate while applying the criteria set out in Article 211(2) of the Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, and, where relevant, to increase or decrease the maximum amount of the Ukraine Guarantee referred to in Article 31(1) of this Regulation by up to 30 %. The Commission may only increase the maximum amount of the Ukraine Guarantee if the provisioning rate is decreased. Without prejudice to Article 31(3) of this Regulation, the Commission may provide that the increased amount of the Ukraine Guarantee shall be available for signature of guarantee agreements gradually over three years.
4.   By way of derogation from Article 213 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046, the effective provisioning rate shall not apply to the provisioning set aside in the common provisioning fund in respect of the Ukraine Guarantee.
