According to Article 26(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the internal market is to comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and services is ensured. The internal market should provide consumers with added value in the form of better quality, greater variety, reasonable prices and high safety standards with regard to goods and services, thereby promoting a high level of consumer protection.
