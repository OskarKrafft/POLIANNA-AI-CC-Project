Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to ensure that a representative action mechanism for the protection of the collective interests of consumers is available in all Member States in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection and contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the cross-border implications of infringements, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.
