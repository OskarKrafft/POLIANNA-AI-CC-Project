Article 1
Subject matter and purpose
1.   This Directive sets out rules to ensure that a representative action mechanism for the protection of the collective interests of consumers is available in all Member States, while providing appropriate safeguards to avoid abusive litigation. The purpose of this Directive is, through the achievement of a high level of consumer protection, to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by approximating certain aspects of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning representative actions. To this end, this Directive also aims to improve consumersâ€™ access to justice.
2.   This Directive does not prevent Member States from adopting or retaining in force procedural means for the protection of the collective interests of consumers at national level. However, Member States shall ensure that at least one procedural mechanism that allows qualified entities to bring representative actions for the purpose of both injunctive measures and redress measures complies with this Directive. The implementation of this Directive shall not constitute grounds for the reduction of consumer protection in fields covered by the scope of the legal acts listed in Annex I.
3.   Qualified entities shall be free to choose any procedural means available to them under Union or national law for the protection of the collective interests of consumers.
