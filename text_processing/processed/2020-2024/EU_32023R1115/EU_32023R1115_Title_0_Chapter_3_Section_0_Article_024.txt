Article 24
Corrective action in the event of non-compliance
1.   Without prejudice to Article 25, where competent authorities establish that an operator or trader has not complied with this Regulation or that a relevant product placed or made available on the market or exported is non-compliant, they shall without delay require the operator or trader to take appropriate and proportionate corrective action to bring the non-compliance to an end within a specified and reasonable period of time.
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the corrective action required to be taken by the operator or trader shall include at least one of the following, as applicable:
(a)
rectifying any formal non-compliance, in particular with the requirements of Chapter 2;
(b)
preventing the relevant product from being placed or made available on the market or exported;
(c)
withdrawing or recalling the relevant product immediately;
(d)
donating the relevant product to charitable or public interest purposes or, if that is not possible, disposing of it in accordance with Union law on waste management.
3.   Irrespective of the corrective action taken under paragraph 2, the operator or trader shall address any shortcomings in the due diligence system with a view to preventing the risk of further non-compliance with this Regulation.
4.   If the operator or trader fails to take corrective action as referred to in paragraph 2 within the period of time specified by the competent authority under paragraph 1, or where non-compliance as referred to in paragraph 1 persists, after that period of time competent authorities shall secure application of the required corrective action referred to in paragraph 2 by all means available to them under the law of the Member State concerned.
