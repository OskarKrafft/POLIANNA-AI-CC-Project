Article 17
Relevant products requiring immediate action
1.   Competent authorities shall identify situations where relevant products present such high risk of non-compliance with Article 3 that they require immediate action by competent authorities before those relevant products are placed or made available on the market or exported. Competent authorities shall register such identified situations in the information system referred to in Article 33.
2.   When competent authorities identify the situations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, including when a due diligence statement relating to the relevant products concerned is submitted by an operator, the information system referred to in Article 33 shall identify the high risk of non-compliance with Article 3 and inform competent authorities, which shall:
(a)
take immediate interim measures under Article 23 to suspend the placing or making available of those relevant products on the market; or
(b)
once the electronic interface referred to in Article 28(1) is in place, in the case of relevant products entering or leaving the market, require customs authorities to suspend the release for free circulation or export of those relevant products under Article 26(7).
3.   The suspensions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall end within three working days or within 72 hours in the case of perishable relevant products, starting from the moment when the high risk of non-compliance is identified in the information system referred to in Article 33. Where the competent authorities, based on the result of the checks carried out within that period, conclude that they require additional time in which to establish whether the relevant products comply with Article 3, they shall extend the period of suspension, by additional periods of three working days, by means of additional interim measures taken under Article 23 or, in the case of relevant products entering or leaving the market, by notifying the customs authorities of the need to maintain the suspension under Article 26(7).
