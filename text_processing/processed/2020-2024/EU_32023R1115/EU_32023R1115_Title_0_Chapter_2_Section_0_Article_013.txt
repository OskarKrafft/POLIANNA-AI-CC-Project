Article 13
Simplified due diligence
1.   When placing relevant products on the market or exporting them, operators shall not be required to fulfil the obligations under Articles 10 and 11 where, after having assessed the complexity of the relevant supply chain and the risk of circumvention of this Regulation or the risk of mixing with products of unknown origin or origin in high-risk or standard-risk countries or parts thereof, they have ascertained that all relevant commodities and relevant products have been produced in countries or parts thereof that were classified as low risk in accordance with Article 29. In such cases, the operator shall make available to the competent authority upon request relevant documentation demonstrating that there is a negligible risk of circumvention of this Regulation or of mixing with products of unknown origin or origin in high-risk or standard-risk countries or parts thereof.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, if the operator obtains or is made aware of any relevant information, including as a result of the assessment carried out under paragraph 1 of this Article, and including substantiated concerns submitted under Article 31, that would point to a risk that the relevant products do not comply with this Regulation or that this Regulation is circumvented, the operator shall fulfil all of the obligations under Articles 10 and 11 and shall immediately communicate any relevant information to the competent authority.
3.   Where a competent authority is made aware of any information that would point to a risk of circumvention of this Regulation, including in cases in which relevant commodities or relevant products produced in a standard-risk or high-risk country or a part thereof are subsequently processed in a low-risk country or a part thereof from where they are placed on or leave the market, the competent authority shall take immediate action in accordance with Article 17(1) and, where necessary, adopt interim measures in accordance with Article 23.
