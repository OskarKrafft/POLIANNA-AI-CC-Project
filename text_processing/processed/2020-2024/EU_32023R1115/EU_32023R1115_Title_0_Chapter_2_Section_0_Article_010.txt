Article 10
Risk assessment
1.   Operators shall verify and analyse the information collected in accordance with Article 9 and any other relevant documentation. On the basis of that information and documentation, the operators shall carry out a risk assessment to establish whether there is a risk that the relevant products intended to be placed on the market or exported are non-compliant. Operators shall not place the relevant products on the market or export them, except where the risk assessment reveals no or only a negligible risk that the relevant products are non-compliant.
2.   The risk assessment shall take into account, in particular, the following criteria:
(a)
the assignment of risk to the relevant country of production or parts thereof in accordance with Article 29;
(b)
the presence of forests in the country of production or parts thereof;
(c)
the presence of indigenous peoples in the country of production or parts thereof;
(d)
the consultation and cooperation in good faith with indigenous peoples in the country of production or parts thereof;
(e)
the existence of duly reasoned claims by indigenous peoples based on objective and verifiable information regarding the use or ownership of the area used for the purpose of producing the relevant commodity;
(f)
prevalence of deforestation or forest degradation in the country of production or parts thereof;
(g)
the source, reliability, validity, and links to other available documentation of the information referred to in Article 9(1);
(h)
concerns in relation to the country of production and origin or parts thereof, such as level of corruption, prevalence of document and data falsification, lack of law enforcement, violations of international human rights, armed conflict or presence of sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council or the Council of the European Union;
(i)
the complexity of the relevant supply chain and the stage of processing of the relevant products, in particular difficulties in connecting relevant products to the plot of land where the relevant commodities were produced;
(j)
the risk of circumvention of this Regulation or of mixing with relevant products of unknown origin or produced in areas where deforestation or forest degradation has occurred or is occurring;
(k)
conclusions of the meetings of the Commission expert groups supporting the implementation of this Regulation, as published in the Commission’s expert group register;
(l)
substantiated concerns submitted under Article 31, and information on the history of non-compliance of operators or traders along the relevant supply chain with this Regulation;
(m)
any information that would point to a risk that the relevant products are non-compliant;
(n)
complementary information on compliance with this Regulation, which may include information supplied by certification or other third-party verified schemes, including voluntary schemes recognised by the Commission under Article 30(5) of Directive(EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), provided that the information meets the requirements set out in Article 9 of this Regulation.
3.   Wood products which fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 that are covered by a valid FLEGT license from an operational licensing scheme shall be deemed to comply with Article 3, point (b), of this Regulation.
4.   The operators shall document and review the risk assessments at least on an annual basis and make them available to the competent authorities upon request. Operators shall be able to demonstrate how the information gathered was checked against the risk assessment criteria set out in paragraph 2 and how they determined the degree of risk.
