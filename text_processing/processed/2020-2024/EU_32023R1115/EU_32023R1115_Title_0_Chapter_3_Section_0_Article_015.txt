3.   The competent authorities and the Commission shall continuously monitor and exchange information on any significant change in the pattern of trade of relevant products that can lead to the circumvention of this Regulation.
4.   Assistance shall be provided in a manner which does not compromise the independence, legal obligations or responsibilities of competent authorities in enforcing this Regulation.
5.   The Commission may facilitate the harmonised implementation of this Regulation, by issuing relevant guidelines and by promoting adequate exchange of information, coordination and cooperation between competent authorities, between competent authorities and customs authorities, and between competent authorities and the Commission.
