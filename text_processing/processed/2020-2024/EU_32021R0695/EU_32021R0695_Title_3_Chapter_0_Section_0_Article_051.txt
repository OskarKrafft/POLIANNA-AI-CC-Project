Article 51
Information, communication, publicity and dissemination and exploitation
1.   The recipients of Union funding shall acknowledge the origin of those funds and ensure the visibility of the Union funding, in particular when promoting the actions and their results (including for prizes), by providing coherent, effective and proportionate targeted information to multiple audiences, including the media and the public.
2.   The Commission shall implement information and communication actions relating to the Programme, to actions under the Programme and to the results obtained. In addition, it shall provide timely and thorough information to Member States and beneficiaries. Evidence-based matchmaking services informed by analytics and network affinities shall be provided to interested entities in order to form consortia for collaborative projects, with particular attention to identifying networking opportunities for legal entities from low R&I performing countries. On the basis of such analysis, targeted matchmaking events may be organised in function of specific calls for proposals.
3.   The Commission shall also establish a dissemination and exploitation strategy for increasing the availability and diffusion of the Programme's R&I results and knowledge to accelerate exploitation towards market uptake and boost the impact of the Programme.
4.   Financial resources allocated to the Programme shall also contribute to the corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union as well as information, communication, publicity, dissemination and exploitation activities insofar as those priorities are related to the objectives referred to in Article 3.
