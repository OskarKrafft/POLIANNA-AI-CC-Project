Article 30
Evaluation review procedure, enquiries and complaints
1.   An applicant may request an evaluation review if it considers that the applicable evaluation procedure has not been correctly applied to its proposal (31).
2.   Only the procedural aspects of an evaluation may be the subject of a request for an evaluation review. The evaluation of the merits of a proposal shall not be the subject of an evaluation review.
3.   A request for an evaluation review shall relate to a specific proposal and shall be submitted within 30 days after the communication of evaluation results.
An evaluation review committee shall provide an opinion on the procedural aspects of the evaluation, and shall be chaired by and include staff of the Commission or of the relevant funding body who were not involved in the evaluation of the proposals. The evaluation review committee may recommend one of the following:
(a)
a re-evaluation of the proposal to be carried out primarily by evaluators who were not involved in the previous evaluation; or
(b)
confirmation of the initial evaluation.
4.   An evaluation review shall not delay the selection process for proposals that are not the subject of that review.
5.   The Commission shall ensure the existence of a procedure for participants to make direct enquiries and complaints about their involvement in the Programme. Information on how to register enquiries or complaints shall be made available online.
