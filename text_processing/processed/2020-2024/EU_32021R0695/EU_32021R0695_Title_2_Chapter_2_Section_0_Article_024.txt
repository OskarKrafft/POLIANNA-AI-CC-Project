Article 24
Calls for proposals
1.   The content of the calls for proposals for all actions shall be included in the work programme.
2.   If necessary to achieve their objectives, calls for proposals may, in exceptional cases, be restricted in order to develop additional activities or to add additional partners to existing actions. In addition, the work programme may provide for the possibility for legal entities from low R&I performing countries to join already selected collaborative R&I actions, subject to the agreement of the respective consortium and provided that legal entities from such countries are not yet participating in it.
3.   A call for proposals is not required for coordination and support actions or programme co-fund actions which:
(a)
are to be carried out by the JRC or legal entities identified in the work programme;
(b)
do not fall within the scope of a call for proposals, in accordance with point (e) of Article 195 of the Financial Regulation.
4.   The work programme shall specify calls for proposals for which Seals of Excellence may be awarded. With prior authorisation from the applicant, information concerning the application and the evaluation may be shared with interested financing authorities, subject to the conclusion of confidentiality agreements.
