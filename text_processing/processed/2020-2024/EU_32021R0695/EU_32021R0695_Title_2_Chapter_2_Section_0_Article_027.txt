Article 27
Financial capacity of applicants
1.   In addition to the exceptions mentioned in Article 198(5) of the Financial Regulation, the financial capacity shall be verified only for the coordinator and only if the requested funding from the Union for the action is equal to or greater than EUR 500 000.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if there are grounds to doubt the financial capacity of an applicant, or if there is a higher risk due to the participation in several ongoing actions funded by Union R&I programmes, the Commission or the relevant funding body shall also verify the financial capacity of other applicants, or of coordinators even where the requested funding is below the threshold referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   If the financial capacity is structurally guaranteed by another legal entity, the financial capacity of that other legal entity shall be verified.
4.   In the case where the financial capacity of an applicant is weak, the Commission or the relevant funding body may make participation of the applicant conditional on provision of a declaration on joint and several liability by an affiliated entity.
5.   The contribution to the Mechanism set out in Article 37 of this Regulation shall be considered to be a sufficient guarantee under Article 152 of the Financial Regulation. No additional guarantee or security shall be accepted from beneficiaries or imposed upon them.
