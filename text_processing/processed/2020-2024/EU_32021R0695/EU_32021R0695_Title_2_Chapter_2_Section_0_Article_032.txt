Article 32
Implementation of the grant
1.   If a beneficiary fails to comply with its obligations regarding the technical implementation of the action, the other beneficiaries shall comply with those obligations without any additional Union funding, unless they are expressly relieved of that obligation. The financial responsibility of each beneficiary shall be limited to its own debt subject to the provisions relating to the Mechanism.
2.   The grant agreement may establish milestones and related pre-financing instalments. If milestones are not reached, the action may be suspended, amended, or, where duly justified, terminated.
3.   An action may also be terminated where expected results have lost their relevance for the Union for scientific or technological reasons or, in the case of the Accelerator, also for economic reasons or, in the case of EIC and missions, also due to their relevance as part of a portfolio of actions. The Commission shall undergo a procedure with the action coordinator and, if appropriate, with independent external experts, before deciding to terminate an action, in accordance with Article 133 of the Financial Regulation.
