5.   Legal entities participating in an action shall ensure the protection against unauthorised disclosure of classified information used or generated by the action. They shall provide proof of personal security clearance or facility security clearance from the relevant national security authorities, prior to the start of the activities concerned.
6.   If independent external experts have to deal with classified information, the appropriate security clearance shall be required before those experts are appointed.
7.   Where appropriate, the Commission or the relevant funding body may carry out security checks.
