Article 23
Legal entities eligible for funding
1.   Legal entities shall be eligible for funding if they are established in a Member State or an associated country. Only legal entities established in the jurisdiction of the delegating managing authority shall be eligible for funding for actions benefiting from amounts under Article 15(5), except if otherwise agreed by that managing authority.
2.   Legal entities established in a non-associated third country shall bear the cost of their participation. However, a legal entity established in low to middle income non-associated third countries and, exceptionally, other non-associated third countries, shall be eligible for funding in an action if:
(a)
the third country is identified in the work programme adopted by the Commission; or
(b)
the Commission or the relevant funding body considers that the participation of the legal entity concerned is essential for implementing the action.
3.   Affiliated entities are eligible for funding in an action if they are established in a Member State, an associated country or in a third country identified in the work programme adopted by the Commission.
4.   The Commission shall make available on a regular basis to the European Parliament and to the Council information concerning the amount of the Union's financial contributions provided to legal entities established in associated and non-associated third countries. As regards associated countries, that information shall also include information on their financial balance.
