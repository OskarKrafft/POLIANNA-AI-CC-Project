Article 33
Grant agreements
1.   The Commission shall, in close cooperation with Member States, draw up model grant agreements between the Commission or the relevant funding body and the beneficiaries in accordance with this Regulation. If a significant modification of a model grant agreement is required, in view, among other things, of further simplification for beneficiaries, the Commission shall, in close cooperation with Member States, revise that model grant agreement as appropriate.
2.   Grant agreements shall establish the rights and obligations of the beneficiaries and of either the Commission or the relevant funding body in compliance with this Regulation. They shall also establish the rights and obligations of legal entities which become beneficiaries during the implementation of the action, as well as the role and tasks of a coordinator.
