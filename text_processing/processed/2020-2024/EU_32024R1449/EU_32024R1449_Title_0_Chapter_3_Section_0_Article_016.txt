Article 16
Amendments to the Reform Agendas
1.   Where the Reform Agenda, including relevant payment conditions, is no longer achievable by the beneficiary, either partially or totally, because of objective circumstances, the beneficiary may propose an amended Reform Agenda. In that case, the beneficiary may make a reasoned request to the Commission to amend its implementing decision referred to in Article 15(1).
2.   The Commission may amend the implementing decision, in particular to take into account a change of the amounts available in line with the principles under Article 21.
3.   Where the Commission considers that the reasons put forward by the beneficiary justify an amendment to its Reform Agenda, the Commission shall assess the amended Agenda in accordance with Article 14 and may amend the implementing decision referred to in Article 15(1) without undue delay.
4.   In an amendment, the Commission may accept timelines for payment conditions extending into 2028. This shall not affect the final deadline set in Article 21(9).
