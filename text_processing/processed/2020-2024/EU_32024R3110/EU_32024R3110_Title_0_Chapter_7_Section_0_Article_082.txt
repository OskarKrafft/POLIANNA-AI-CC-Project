Article 82
Member State incentives for construction products
Where Member States provide incentives for a product category for which the performance is expressed as a class of performance referred to in Article 5(5) or as a class included in environmental sustainability labelling referred to in Article 22(9), those incentives shall be targeted at the highest two classes of performance.
Where classes of performance are defined in relation to more than one sustainability parameter, it shall be indicated in relation to which parameter this Article should be implemented.
When doing so, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria:
(a)
the number of products in each class of performance; and
(b)
the need to ensure the affordability of the products meeting those requirements, in order to avoid significant negative impacts on consumers.
