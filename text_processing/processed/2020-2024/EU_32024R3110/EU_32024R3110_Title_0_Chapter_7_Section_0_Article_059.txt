Article 59
Replacement of type-testing and type-calculation
1.   A manufacturer may replace type-testing or type-calculation with a specific section in the technical documentation referred to in Article 22(3) demonstrating that:
(a)
for one or several essential characteristics of the product, which the manufacturer places on the market, that product is deemed to achieve a certain level or class of performance without testing or calculation, or without further testing or calculation, in accordance with the conditions set out in the delegated acts referred to in Article 5(6); or
(b)
the product, covered by a harmonised technical specification or a European assessment document, which the manufacturer places on the market is a system made of components, which the manufacturer duly assembles following precise instructions, including compatibility criteria in the case of individual components, given by the provider of such a system or of a component thereof, who has already tested that system or that component for one or several of its essential characteristics in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specification or European assessment document. When these conditions are satisfied and when the manufacturer has notably verified that the precise compatibility criteria of the provider are met, the manufacturer is entitled to declare performance corresponding to all or part of the test results provided to it for the system or the component;
(c)
the product, covered by a harmonised technical specification or by a European technical assessment, which the manufacturer places on the market, corresponds to a product-type of a product manufactured by another manufacturer and is already subject to type-testing or type-calculation.
When the conditions in point (c) are satisfied, the manufacturer may declare the performance corresponding to all or part of the results of this other product. The manufacturer shall only apply this simplification after having obtained an authorisation of the other manufacturer, who remains responsible for the accuracy, reliability and stability of those test results.
2.   If the assessment and verification system applicable includes a performance assessment by a notified body as set out in Annex IX, a notified body or TAB shall, in place of the assessment of the performance of the product set out in Annex IX, assess and certify the correct fulfilment of the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
