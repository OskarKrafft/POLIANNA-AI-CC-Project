Article 74
Shared roles and joint decision-making
1.   In order to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation with regard to market surveillance, designation and supervision of TABs, notified bodies, and product contact points for construction, Member States may designate:
(a)
a body or authority set up in cooperation with another Member State or other Member States for the purpose of joint designation;
(b)
a body or authority already designated by another Member State for the same purpose, in cooperation with that Member State.
The Member States concerned shall jointly ensure that the shared bodies or authorities meet all relevant requirements. They shall be jointly responsible for them, whilst decisions taken towards natural or legal persons on a certain Member State shall be legally attributable only to that Member State.
2.   The authorities of different Member States may, without prejudice to their individual obligations under this Regulation or other legislative acts, share resources and responsibilities in order to ensure the harmonised application or effective enforcement of this Regulation.
To that end, they may also:
(a)
take joint decisions, especially in relation to joint cross-border activities or in relation to economic operators active on the territory of the relevant Member States;
(b)
establish common projects, such as joint market surveillance or testing projects;
(c)
pool resources for specific purposes, such as building up testing capacity or for internet surveillance;
(d)
delegate the execution of tasks to a peer authority of another Member State, whilst staying formally responsible for the decisions taken by that authority;
(e)
transfer a task from one Member State to the other, provided that such transfer is clearly communicated to all concerned.
The relevant Member States shall be jointly responsible for the actions taken in accordance with this paragraph.
