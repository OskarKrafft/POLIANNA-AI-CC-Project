Article 33
Obligations of the TAB receiving a request for a European technical assessment
1.   When receiving a request for a European technical assessment from a manufacturer, a group of manufacturers or a manufacturers’ association, the TAB shall comply with the following requirements:
(a)
where the product is covered by a harmonised technical specification or a European assessment document cannot be drawn up in accordance with Article 31, the TAB shall inform the applicant that a European technical assessment cannot be issued;
(b)
where the product is fully covered by a European assessment document the reference of which has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the TAB shall inform the applicant that the referenced European assessment document will be used as the basis for the European technical assessment to be issued;
(c)
where the product is eligible for a European assessment document referred to in Article 31, and no such document is in the process of being developed, the TAB shall inform the applicant that the procedures set out in Annex VI will be initiated.
In the cases referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of this Article, but where a harmonised standard covering the same product is expected to be delivered in a period longer than one year as established in a standardisation request referred to in Article 5(2), the TAB shall inform the applicant about the possibility of a European assessment document no longer being used pursuant to Article 31(6).
2.   In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, points (b) and (c) of this Article, the TAB shall inform the organisation of TABs and the Commission of the content of the request and of the reference to a relevant delegated act determining the assessment and verification system referred to in Article 10(2), which the TAB intends to apply for that product, or of the lack of such delegated act.
3.   If the Commission considers that an appropriate delegated act determining the assessment and verification system does not exist for the product, it may adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 10(2).
