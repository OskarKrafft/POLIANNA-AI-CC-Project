Article 44
Requirements relating to notifying authorities
1.   The notifying authority shall be established in such a way that no conflicts of interest with notified bodies occur.
2.   The notifying authority shall be organised and operated so as to safeguard the objectivity and impartiality of its activities.
3.   The notifying authority shall be organised in such a way that each decision relating to notification of a body to be authorised to carry out third-party tasks in the assessment and verification process is taken by competent persons different from those who carried out the assessment.
4.   The notifying authority shall not offer or provide any activities that notified bodies perform, or consultancy services on a commercial or competitive basis.
5.   The notifying authority shall safeguard the confidentiality of the information obtained. However, it shall, upon request, exchange information on notified bodies with the Commission, with notifying authorities of other Member States and with other competent national authorities which shall safeguard the confidentiality of the information received.
6.   The notifying authority, including in the cases in which the notifying authority is the national accreditation body, shall assess only the specific conformity assessment body applying for notification and not take account of the capacities or personnel of parent or sister companies. The notifying authority shall assess that body in relation to all relevant requirements and third-party assessment and verification tasks.
7.   The notifying authority shall have a sufficient number of competent personnel and sufficient funding at its disposal for the proper performance of its tasks.
