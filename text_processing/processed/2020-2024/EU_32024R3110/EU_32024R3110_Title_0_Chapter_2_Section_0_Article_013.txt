Article 13
Declaration of performance and conformity
1.   Where a product is covered by a harmonised technical specification adopted in accordance with Articles 5 or 6, the manufacturer shall undergo the applicable assessment and verification system set out in Annex IX and draw up a declaration of performance and conformity before such a product is placed on the market. Where a product is covered by a harmonised technical specification adopted in accordance with Article 7, the manufacturer shall also verify the product’s compliance with applicable product requirements that have been specified by delegated acts. The manufacturer of a product which is not covered by any harmonised technical specification may issue a declaration of performance and conformity in accordance with the relevant European assessment document and European technical assessment.
2.   By drawing up the declaration of performance and conformity, the manufacturer assumes responsibility for the conformity of the product with its declared performance and any applicable product requirements, and becomes liable in accordance with Union and national laws on contractual and extra-contractual liability. In the absence of objective indications to the contrary, Member States shall presume the declaration of performance and conformity drawn up by the manufacturer to be accurate and reliable.
In the event of non-compliance, or in the absence of a declaration of performance and conformity when such a declaration is required, the product may not be made available on the market.
