Article 93
Evaluation
No later than 9 January 2033 and at least every six years thereafter, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this Regulation and of its contribution to the functioning of the internal market and the improvement of the environmental sustainability of products and construction works and built environment. That evaluation shall, inter alia, assess the correlation of this Regulation with Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 and the potential environmental and economic benefits and the impact of extended producer responsibility of manufacturers of certain construction products and of the regain of ownership of surplus and unsold products at Union level. The Commission shall also evaluate the effect of the application of this Regulation on the state of the market for different categories of used products. The Commission shall evaluate whether the penalties applied by the Member States are effective and whether they create fragmentation in the internal market. The Commission shall, if necessary, suggest how to harmonise those penalties.
The Commission shall present a report on the main findings to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions. Member States shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of that report.
Where appropriate, the report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal for the amendment of the relevant provisions of this Regulation.
