Article 66
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 65(4), (6) and (7), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union legislation, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator and shall evaluate the national measure. The consultation period shall not exceed two months. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall endeavour to adopt implementing acts, within two additional months, after the end of consultation period, setting out its decision as to whether the measure is justified or not.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred in Article 90(2).
The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator.
2.   If the national measure is considered to be justified, all Member States shall, without delay, ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal, are taken in respect of the non-compliant product and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national measure is considered to be unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.
3.   Where the national measure is considered to be justified and the non-compliance of the product or its manufacturer is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised technical specifications, European assessment documents, voluntary harmonised standards or common specifications established by implementing acts as referred to in Article 65(5), point (d), the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 5(9), Article 6(5), Article 7(6) or Article 36 of this Regulation or in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, as appropriate.
