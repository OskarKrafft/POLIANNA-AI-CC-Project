Article 29
Online and other distance sales
1.   Products offered for sale online or through other means of distance sales shall be deemed to be made available on the market if the offer is targeted at customers in the Union. An offer for sale shall be considered to be targeted at customers in the Union if the relevant economic operator directs, by any means, its activities to a Member State. An offer shall, inter alia, be considered to be targeted at customers in the Union where:
(a)
the economic operator uses the currency of a Member State;
(b)
the economic operator has used an internet domain name registered in one of the Member States, or uses an internet domain that refers to the Union or to one of the Member States; or
(c)
the geographical areas to which dispatch is available include a Member State.
The conditions listed in the first subparagraph shall not apply if the economic operator explicitly and effectively excludes the Union market.
2.   Where an economic operator makes a product available on the market online or through other means of distance selling, the offer of that product shall, where required, clearly and visibly indicate the CE marking, the information listed in Article 18(2), the label pursuant to Article 22(9) and a data carrier connected to a digital product passport in accordance with Article 22(7).
3.   Any natural or legal person providing an intermediary service for the placing on the market of products shall fulfil the obligations of an economic operator pursuant to paragraph 2 in relation to the services provided.
