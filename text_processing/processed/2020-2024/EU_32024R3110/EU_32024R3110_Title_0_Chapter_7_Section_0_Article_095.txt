1.   Product contact points for construction designated under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 shall be deemed to have been designated under this Regulation as well.
2.   TABs and notified bodies that are designated or notified under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 shall be deemed to have been designated or notified under this Regulation as well.

The objection procedure set out in Article 51(5) of this Regulation shall apply.
3.   Harmonised standards the references of which are included in the list published in accordance with Article 17(5) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 that are in force on 8 January 2026 shall remain valid under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 until they are withdrawn by the Commission or otherwise repealed.
4.   European assessment documents, the references of which are included in the list published in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 by 8 January 2026, shall remain valid until 9 January 2031, unless they have expired for other reasons. Products shall not be placed on the market on the basis of European technical assessments issued in accordance with these European assessment documents after 9 January 2036.
5.   When a harmonised technical specification adopted in accordance with Article 5(8) or Article 6(1) of this Regulation covers the same product and the same intended use as a European assessment document, the reference of which is included in the list published in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, the European assessment document shall no longer be used for the purposes of this Regulation and products shall not be placed on the market on the basis of European technical assessments issued in accordance with this European assessment document.
6.   European technical assessments issued pursuant to European assessment documents the references of which are not included in the list published in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 by 8 January 2026 shall be treated as European technical assessment requests under this Regulation. The administrative transfer shall be done at no cost for the manufacturer.
7.   Certificates, test reports and European technical assessments issued under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 may be used as the technical basis to demonstrate a product’s compliance with this Regulation in cases where the product type corresponds to a product type under this Regulation and the requirements and assessment methods are valid in the light of the applicable harmonised technical specification or European assessment document. The recognition of such documents shall be possible under the conditions set out in Article 62 of this Regulation, applied mutatis mutandis.
8.   Article 2, Articles 4 to 9, Articles 11 to 18, Articles 27 and 28, Articles 36 to 40, Articles 47 to 49, Articles 52 and 53, Article 55 and Articles 60 to 64 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 shall only apply to products covered by standards referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article or to products covered by European assessment documents referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article.
For the purposes of Article 5(7), Article 6(1), and Article 31(2) of this Regulation, harmonised standards the references of which are included in the list published in accordance with Article 17(5) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 and which have not been withdrawn shall be treated as performance harmonised standards.
9.   The requirements and obligations of economic operators set out in Chapters I, II and III shall only be applicable to a certain product family or product category within such a family from one year after the date of adoption of an implementing act referred to in Article 5(8) making a harmonised standard mandatory or an implementing act referred to in Article 6(1), covering that product family or product category, unless a later application date has been specified in the implementing act. However, economic operators may choose to apply those harmonised technical specifications as from their entry into force by undergoing the procedure leading to a declaration of performance and conformity.
10.   Within one year following the date of application of requirements and obligations in relation to a certain product family or product category as set out in paragraph 9 of this Article, the Commission shall withdraw from the Official Journal of the European Union references of harmonised standards and European assessment documents or parts thereof published there in accordance with Articles 17(5) and 22 of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 when they cover the same respective product family or product category.
