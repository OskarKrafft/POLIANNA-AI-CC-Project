Article 67
Compliant products which nevertheless present a risk
1.   Where, having performed an evaluation pursuant to Article 65(1), a market surveillance authority finds that, although a product is in compliance with this Regulation, it presents a risk to the health or safety of persons or, where applicable, to the environment or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the products concerned, when placed on the market, no longer present that risk, to withdraw the products from the market or to recall them within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the risk, which it may prescribe.
2.   The economic operator shall ensure that any corrective action is taken in respect of all the products concerned which that economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.
3.   The market surveillance authority shall, via the single liaison point, immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the product concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the product, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.
4.   The Commission shall without delay consult the Member States and the relevant economic operators and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act setting out its decision whether the measure is justified or not and, where necessary, ordering appropriate measures.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 90(2).
5.   The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and to the relevant economic operator.
