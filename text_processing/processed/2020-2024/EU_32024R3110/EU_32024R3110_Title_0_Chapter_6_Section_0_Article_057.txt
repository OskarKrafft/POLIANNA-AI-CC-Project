Article 57
Implementing acts on notified bodies’ obligations
Where this is necessary to ensure a harmonised application of this Regulation and where the coordination group of notifying and designating authorities have not been able to resolve a dispute concerning their diverging practices, in accordance with Article 45, and only to the extent necessary to prevent diverging practices fragmenting the internal market for economic operators, the Commission may adopt implementing acts providing details on how to execute the obligations of notified bodies contained in Articles 55 and 56.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 90(3).
