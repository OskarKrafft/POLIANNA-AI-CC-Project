Article 12
Relationship with other Union law
1.   To avoid double assessment of the same aspects of health and safety of persons or protection of the environment in respect of products, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 to supplement this Regulation by laying down the conditions under which obligations relating to the assessment of a product’s performance or the fulfilment of certain product requirements, including the equivalence of assessment and verification systems required under this Regulation and obligations as regards general product information, instructions for use and safety information requirements, can be satisfied by the fulfilment of obligations provided for under other Union law.
The conditions referred to in the first subparagraph shall not allow for product safety levels which are less strict than those established in accordance with this Regulation.
2.   Where conflicts arise between this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 as well as Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, the relevant provisions of this Regulation shall prevail.
