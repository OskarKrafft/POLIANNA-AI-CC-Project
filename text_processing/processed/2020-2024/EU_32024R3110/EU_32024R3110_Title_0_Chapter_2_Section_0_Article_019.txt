Article 19
Other markings and performance claims
1.   Markings other than the CE marking, including private ones, may be affixed to a product only if they do not indicate that the product’s performance in relation to essential characteristics covered by applicable harmonised technical specifications had to be assessed in a way different from that laid down by this Regulation.
Officially recognised EN ISO 14024 type I ecolabels may be affixed to a product if they fulfil the requirement in the first subparagraph.
2.   Markings allowed in accordance with paragraph 1 and other markings set out by Union legislation may be affixed to a product provided that they do not impair the visibility, legibility and meaning of the CE marking.
3.   Where a product is covered by a harmonised technical specification, a claim made by an economic operator about the product’s performance, which concerns an essential characteristic covered by that harmonised technical specification, shall comply with the assessment method for that particular essential characteristic as laid down in the harmonised technical specifications.
4.   Where a product is covered by harmonised technical specifications, claims about its performance in relation to the essential characteristics laid down in those harmonised technical specifications may be additionally provided in a place other than in the declaration of performance and conformity only if they are already provided in the declaration of performance and conformity.
The first subparagraph shall not apply to situations where, in accordance with Article 14, no declaration of performance and conformity has been drawn up.
