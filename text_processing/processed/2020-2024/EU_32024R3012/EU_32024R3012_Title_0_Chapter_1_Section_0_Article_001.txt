Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1.   The objective of this Regulation is to facilitate and encourage the deployment of permanent carbon removals, carbon farming and carbon storage in products by operators or groups of operators, as a complement to sustained emission reductions across all sectors to meet the objectives and targets laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119. To that end, this Regulation establishes a voluntary Union framework for the certification of carbon removals and soil emission reductions by laying down:
(a)
quality criteria for activities that take place in the Union;
(b)
rules for the verification and certification of carbon removals and soil emission reductions generated by activities;
(c)
rules for the functioning and recognition by the Commission of certification schemes;
(d)
rules on the issuance and use of certified units.
2.   This Regulation aims to support the achievement of the Union objectives under the Paris Agreement, in particular the collective achievement, at the latest by 2050, of the climate-neutrality objective laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119. Accordingly, all carbon removals and soil emission reductions generated under this Regulation shall contribute to the achievement of the Union’s NDC and its climate objectives and not to third-party-NDCs or international compliance schemes.
3.   This Regulation does not apply to emissions falling within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC, with the exception of the capture and storage of CO2 emissions from biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels that meet the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria established under Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, with any necessary adjustments for application under Directive 2003/87/EC, as set out in the implementing acts referred to in Article 14 of Directive 2003/87/EC, in accordance with Annex IV to Directive 2003/87/EC.
