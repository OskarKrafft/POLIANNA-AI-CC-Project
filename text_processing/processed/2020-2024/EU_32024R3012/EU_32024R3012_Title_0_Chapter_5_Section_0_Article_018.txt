Article 18
Review
1.   This Regulation shall be kept under review in all aspects, taking into account:
(a)
relevant developments concerning Union law, including its consistency with Regulations (EU) 2018/841, (EU) No 2018/842 and (EU) 2021/1119 and Directives 2003/87/EC and (EU) 2018/2001;
(b)
relevant developments concerning the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, including rules and guidelines related to the implementation of Article 6 of that Agreement;
(c)
technological and scientific progress, best practices and market developments in the field of carbon removals;
(d)
the potential for permanent carbon storage in third countries, subject to the existence of international agreements referred to in Chapter III of Regulation (EU) 2024/1735, while providing for conditions equivalent to those laid down in Directive 2009/31/EC to ensure that geological storage of CO2 that is captured is permanently secure and environmentally safe;
(e)
the environmental impact of increased biomass use resulting from the application of this Regulation, including the impact on land degradation and ecosystem restoration;
(f)
the impact on Union food security and land speculation; and
(g)
the cost of the certification process.
2.   By 27 December 2027, and subsequently within six months of the outcome of each global stocktake agreed under Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of this Regulation.
3.   By 31 July 2026, the Commission shall review the application of this Regulation to emissions reduction from the IPCC source category of agriculture, subcategory of 3.A enteric fermentation and subcategory of 3.B manure management, as determined pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and the implementing acts adopted pursuant to that Regulation, taking into consideration opportunity costs, the evolution of the regulatory framework, possible negative effects leading to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and the Union 2040 climate target as proposed in accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, and submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council. That report shall be based, inter alia, on a pilot certification methodology for activities that reduce agricultural emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management.
The Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal accompanying that report to extend the scope of the activities covered under this Regulation to emissions reduction from the IPCC source category of agriculture, subcategory of 3.A enteric fermentation and subcategory of 3.B manure management, as determined pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
4.   By 31 July 2026, the Commission shall assess additional requirements needed to align this Regulation with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and best practices, including corresponding adjustments, host party authorisation and methodologies. In that assessment, the Commission shall review the use of certified units to compensate for emissions generated outside of the Union’s NDC and the Union’s climate objectives. That assessment shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
