Article 5
Additionality
1.   Any activity shall be additional. To that end, it shall meet both of the following criteria:
(a)
it goes beyond Union and national statutory requirements at the level of an individual operator;
(b)
the incentive effect of the certification under this Regulation is needed for the activity to become financially viable.
2.   Where a standardised baseline is used, additionality as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be considered to be complied with.
Where an activity-specific baseline is used, additionality as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be demonstrated through specific additionality tests in accordance with the applicable certification methodologies set out in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 8.
