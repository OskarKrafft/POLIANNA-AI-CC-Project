Article 13
Recognition of certification schemes
1.   Only a certification scheme recognised by the Commission by means of a decision may be used by an operator or a group of operators to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation. Such decision shall be valid for a period of no more than five years and shall be made publicly available in the Union registry.
2.   A Member State shall notify to the Commission an application for recognition of a public certification scheme.
The legal representative of a private certification scheme shall notify to the Commission an application for recognition of that private certification scheme.
3.   The Commission may, after appropriate consultation with the certification scheme, repeal a decision recognising that scheme pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article where the certification scheme fails to implement the rules set out in the implementing acts referred to in Article 11(5).
Where a Member State or any other interested party raises duly substantiated concerns that a certification scheme does not operate in accordance with the rules set out in the implementing acts referred to in Article 11(5) which constitute the basis for decisions under paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall investigate the matter and take appropriate action, including repealing the relevant decision.
4.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out the structure, format and technical details of the recognition and notification processes referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 17.
