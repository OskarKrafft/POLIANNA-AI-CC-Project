Article 17
Regulatory incentives
1.   Where a project promoter incurs higher risks for the development, construction, operation or maintenance of a project of common interest falling under the competence of national regulatory authorities, when compared to the risks normally incurred by a comparable infrastructure project, Member States and national regulatory authorities may grant appropriate incentives to that project in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 715/2009, Article 18(1) and Article 18(3) to (6) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, Article 41(8) of Directive 2009/73/EC and Article 58, point (f), of Directive (EU) 2019/944.
The first subparagraph shall not apply where the project of common interest has received an exemption:
(a)
from Articles 32, 33, and 34 and from Article 41(6), (8) and (10) of Directive 2009/73/EC, pursuant to Article 36 of that Directive;
(b)
from Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 or from Article 6, Article 59(7) and Article 60(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 pursuant to Article 63 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943;
(c)
pursuant to Article 36 of Directive 2009/73/EC;
(d)
pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.
2.   In the case of a decision to grant the incentives referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, national regulatory authorities shall consider the results of the cost-benefit analysis consistent with the methodology drawn up pursuant to Article 11 and in particular the regional or Union-wide positive externalities generated by the project. The national regulatory authorities shall further analyse the specific risks incurred by the project promoters, the risk mitigation measures taken and the reasons for the risk profile in view of the net positive impact provided by the project, when compared to a lower-risk alternative. Eligible risks shall in particular include risks related to new transmission technologies, both onshore and offshore, risks related to under-recovery of costs and development risks.
3.   The decision to grant the incentives shall take into account the specific nature of the risk incurred and may grant incentives covering, inter alia, one or more of the following measures:
(a)
the rules for anticipatory investment;
(b)
the rules for recognition of efficiently incurred costs before commissioning of the project;
(c)
the rules for providing additional return on the capital invested for the project;
(d)
any other measure deemed necessary and appropriate.
4.   By 24 January 2023, each national regulatory authority shall submit to the Agency its methodology and the criteria used to evaluate investments in energy infrastructure projects and the higher risks incurred by those projects, updated in view of latest legislative, policy, technological and market developments. Such methodology and criteria shall also expressly address the specific risks incurred by offshore grids for renewable energy referred to in point (1)(f) of Annex II and by projects, which, while having low capital expenditure, incur significant operating expenditure.
5.   By 24 June 2023, taking due account of the information received pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, the Agency shall facilitate the sharing of good practices and make recommendations in accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/942 regarding both of the following:
(a)
the incentives referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of a benchmarking of best practice by national regulatory authorities;
(b)
a common methodology to evaluate the incurred higher risks of investments in energy infrastructure projects.
6.   By 24 September 2023, each national regulatory authority shall publish its methodology and the criteria used to evaluate investments in energy infrastructure projects and the higher risks incurred by them.
7.   Where the measures referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 are not sufficient to ensure the timely implementation of projects of common interest, the Commission may issue guidelines regarding the incentives laid down in this Article.
