4.   For projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Annex II, the criteria set out in paragraph 3 of this Article shall be assessed in accordance with the indicators set out in points (3) to (8) of Annex IV.
5.   In order to facilitate the assessment of all projects that could be eligible as projects of common interest and that could be included in a regional list, each Group shall assess each project’s contribution to the implementation of the same energy infrastructure priority corridor or area in a transparent and objective manner. Each Group shall determine its assessment method on the basis of the aggregated contribution to the criteria referred to in paragraph 3. That assessment shall lead to a ranking of projects for internal use of the Group. Neither the regional list nor the Union list shall contain any ranking, nor shall the ranking be used for any subsequent purpose except as described in Section 2, point (16), of Annex III.
In assessing projects, in order to ensure a consistent assessment approach among the Groups, each Group shall give due consideration to:
(a)
the urgency and the contribution of each proposed project in order to meet the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate and its 2050 climate neutrality objective, market integration, competition, sustainability, and security of supply;
(b)
the complementarity of each proposed project with other proposed projects, including competing or potentially competing projects;
(c)
possible synergies with priority corridors and thematic areas identified under trans-European networks for transport and telecommunications;
(d)
for proposed projects that are, at the time of the assessment, projects on the Union list, the progress of their implementation and their compliance with the reporting and transparency obligations.
As regards smart electricity grids and smart gas grids projects falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in point (1)(e) and point (2) of Annex II, ranking shall be carried out for those projects that affect the same two Member States, and due consideration shall also be given to the number of users affected by the project, the annual energy consumption and the share of generation from non-dispatchable resources in the area covered by those users.
