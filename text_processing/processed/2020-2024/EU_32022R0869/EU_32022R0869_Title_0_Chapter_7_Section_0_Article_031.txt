Article 31
Transitional period
1.   During a transitional period ending on 31 December 2029, dedicated hydrogen assets converted from natural gas assets falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in point (3) of Annex II may be used for transport or storage of a predefined blend of hydrogen with natural gas or biomethane.
2.   During the transitional period referred to in paragraph 1, the project promoters shall closely cooperate on project design and implementation in order to ensure interoperability of neighbouring networks.
3.   The project promoter shall provide sufficient evidence, including through commercial contracts, how, by the end of the transitional period, the assets referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article will cease to be natural gas assets and become dedicated hydrogen assets, as set out in point (3) of Annex II, and how the increased use of hydrogen will be enabled during the transitional period. Such evidence shall include an assessment of the supply and demand for renewable or low-carbon hydrogen as well as a calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction enabled by the project. In the context of the monitoring of progress achieved in implementing the projects of common interest, the Agency shall verify the timely transition of the project to a dedicated hydrogen asset as set out in point (3) of Annex II.
4.   Eligibility of projects referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article for Union financial assistance under Article 18 shall end on 31 December 2027.
