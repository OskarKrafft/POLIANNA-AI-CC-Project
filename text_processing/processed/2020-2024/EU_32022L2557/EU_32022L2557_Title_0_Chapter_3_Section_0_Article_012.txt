Article 12
Risk assessment by critical entities
1.   Notwithstanding the deadline set out in Article 6(3), second subparagraph, Member States shall ensure that critical entities carry out a risk assessment within nine months of receiving the notification referred to in Article 6(3), whenever necessary subsequently, and at least every four years, on the basis of Member State risk assessments and other relevant sources of information, in order to assess all relevant risks that could disrupt the provision of their essential services (‘critical entity risk assessment’).
2.   Critical entity risk assessments shall account for all the relevant natural and man-made risks which could lead to an incident, including those of a cross-sectoral or cross-border nature, accidents, natural disasters, public health emergencies and hybrid threats and other antagonistic threats, including terrorist offences as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/541. A critical entity risk assessment shall take into account the extent to which other sectors as set out in the Annex depend on the essential service provided by the critical entity and the extent to which that critical entity depends on essential services provided by other entities in such other sectors, including, where relevant, in neighbouring Member States and third countries.
Where a critical entity has carried out other risk assessments or drawn up documents pursuant to obligations laid down in other legal acts that are relevant for its critical entity risk assessment, it may use those assessments and documents to meet the requirements set out in this Article. When exercising its supervisory functions, the competent authority may declare an existing risk assessment carried out by a critical entity that addresses the risks and extent of dependence referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph as compliant, in whole or in part, with the obligations under this Article.
