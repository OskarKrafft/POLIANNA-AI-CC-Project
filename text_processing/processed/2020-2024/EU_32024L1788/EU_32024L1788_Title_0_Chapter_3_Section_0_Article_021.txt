Article 21
Conventional meters for natural gas
1.   Where final natural gas customers do not have smart meters, Member States shall ensure that final customers are provided with individual conventional meters that accurately measure their actual consumption. Member States may exempt household customers that do not use natural gas for heating purposes from this requirement where the deployment of such meters is not technically possible, financially reasonable or proportionate to the potential energy savings. That exemption may also be extended to non-household customers located in buildings where the majority of customers are household customers eligible for the exemption, if the deployment is not technically feasible.
2.   Member States shall ensure that final natural gas customers are able to easily read their conventional meters, either directly or indirectly through an online interface or through another appropriate interface.
