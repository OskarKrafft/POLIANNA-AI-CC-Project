Article 34
Direct lines for natural gas
1.   Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable:
(a)
natural gas undertakings established within their territory to supply the eligible customers through a direct line; and
(b)
any such customer within their territory to be supplied through a direct line by natural gas undertakings.
2.   In circumstances where an authorisation, such as a licence, permission, concession, consent or approval, is required for the construction or operation of direct lines, the Member States or any competent authority they designate shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction or operation of such lines in their territory. Those criteria shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.
3.   Member States may issue an authorisation to construct a direct line subject either to the refusal of system access based on Article 38 or to the opening of a dispute-settlement procedure pursuant to Article 79.
