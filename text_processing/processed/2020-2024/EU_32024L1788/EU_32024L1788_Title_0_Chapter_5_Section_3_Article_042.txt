Article 42
Decision-making powers regarding the connection to the transmission system and the hydrogen transmission network
1.   The transmission system operator and the hydrogen transmission network operator shall establish and publish transparent and efficient procedures and tariffs for non-discriminatory connection of natural gas and hydrogen storage facilities, LNG facilities, hydrogen terminals and industrial customers to the transmission system and the hydrogen transmission network. Those procedures shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authority.
2.   The transmission system operator and the hydrogen transmission network operator shall not be entitled to refuse the connection of a new natural gas or hydrogen storage facility, LNG facility, hydrogen terminal or industrial customer on the grounds of possible future limitations to available network capacities or additional costs linked with necessary capacity increase. The transmission system operator and hydrogen transmission network operator shall ensure sufficient entry and exit capacity for the new connection.
