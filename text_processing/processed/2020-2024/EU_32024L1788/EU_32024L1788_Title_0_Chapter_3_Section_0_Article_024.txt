Article 24
Single points of contact
Member States shall ensure that single points of contact are established to provide all customers, including those without access to the internet, with all necessary information concerning their rights, certified comparison tools, available support measures, including those targeted at vulnerable customers as referred to in Article 26 of this Directive, the applicable law and out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms available to them in the event of a dispute. Such single points of contact may be part of general consumer information points and may be the same entities as the single contact points for electricity referred to in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 or contact points established pursuant to Article 16(3) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and one-stop shops established pursuant to Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2023/1791, and Article 18 of Directive (EU) 2024/1275. Member States shall promote alignment between the single points of contact established pursuant to this Directive and the bodies established pursuant to those Union legal acts.
