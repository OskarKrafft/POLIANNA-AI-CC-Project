Article 40
Confidentiality for transmission system operators and transmission system owners
1.   Without prejudice to Article 74 or any other legal duty to disclose information, each transmission, storage or LNG system operator for natural gas, and each transmission system owner, shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its activities, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be commercially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. If the transmission, storage or LNG system operator for natural gas, or the transmission system owner, is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall not disclose, in particular, any commercially sensitive information to the remaining parts of the vertically integrated undertaking other than transmission system operators, distribution system operators or hydrogen network operators, unless this is necessary for carrying out a business transaction. In order to ensure the full respect of the rules on information unbundling, Member States shall ensure that the transmission system owner, including in the case of a combined operator the distribution system operator, and the remaining parts of the undertaking which are not transmission or distribution system operators or hydrogen network operators, do not use joint services, such as joint legal services, apart from purely administrative or IT functions.
2.   Transmission, storage or LNG system operators for natural gas shall not, in the context of sales or purchases of natural gas by related undertakings, misuse commercially sensitive information obtained from third parties in the context of providing or negotiating access to the system.
3.   Information necessary for effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market shall be made public. That obligation shall be without prejudice to protecting commercially sensitive information.
