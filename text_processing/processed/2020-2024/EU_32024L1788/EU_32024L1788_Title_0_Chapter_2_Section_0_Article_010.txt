Article 10
Technical rules
1.   Member States or, where Member States have so provided, the regulatory authorities shall ensure that technical safety criteria are established and that technical rules establishing the minimum technical design and operational requirements for the connection to the system of LNG facilities, natural gas storage facilities, other transmission or distribution systems, or direct lines, as well as to the hydrogen system, are developed and made public. Those technical rules shall ensure the interoperability of systems and shall be objective and non-discriminatory. ACER may make appropriate recommendations towards achieving compatibility of those rules, where appropriate. Those rules shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council (43).
2.   Where relevant, Member States or, where Member States have so provided, the regulatory authorities shall require transmission system operators, distribution system operators and hydrogen network operators in their territory to publish technical rules in accordance with this Article, in particular regarding network connection rules that include gas quality, gas odorisation and gas pressure requirements. Member States shall also require transmission and distribution system operators to publish the connection fees to connect gas from renewable sources based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.
