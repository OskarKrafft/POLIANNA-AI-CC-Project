Article 41
Decision-making powers regarding the connection of production facilities for renewable gas and low-carbon gas to the transmission system
1.   The transmission system operator shall establish and publish transparent and efficient procedures for non-discriminatory connection of production facilities for renewable gas and low-carbon gas, in line with the capacities identified in the ten-year network development plan referred to in Article 55. Those procedures shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authorities. Member States may grant production facilities for biomethane priority to connect.
2.   The transmission system operators shall not be entitled to refuse economically reasonable and technically feasible connection requests of a new or of an existing but not yet connected production facility for renewable gas and low-carbon gas, except under the conditions set out in Article 38.
3.   For the purpose of the swift implementation of grid connection of biomethane production, Member States shall endeavour to ensure that the transmission system operator complies with reasonable time limits to assess requests for the injection of biomethane, make an offer and implement the connection, under the monitoring by the regulatory authorities carried out in accordance with Article 78(1), point (t).
