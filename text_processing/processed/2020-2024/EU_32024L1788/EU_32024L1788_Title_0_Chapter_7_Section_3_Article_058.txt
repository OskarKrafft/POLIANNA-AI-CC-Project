Article 58
Connection fees and costs for biomethane production facilities
1.   Member States shall provide an enabling regulatory framework for biomethane production facilities in relation to connection fees and costs resulting from their connection to the transmission or distribution networks. Such regulatory framework shall ensure that:
(a)
connection fees and costs take into account the energy efficiency first principle applicable to network development in accordance with Article 3 and Article 27(2) of Directive (EU) 2023/1791;
(b)
connection fees and costs are published as part of the procedures for the connection of new production facilities for renewable gas and low-carbon gas to the transmission and distribution system established in Articles 41 and 45 of this Directive and pursuant to Article 20(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001;
(c)
the principles of transparency and non-discrimination, the need for stable financial frameworks for existing investments, the advancement of the roll-out of renewable gas and low-carbon gas in the Member State concerned and the existence of alternative support mechanisms for scaling up the use of renewable gas or low-carbon gas, where appropriate, are taken into account.
2.   When setting or approving tariffs or the methodologies to be used by transmission system operators and distribution system operators, regulatory authorities may take into account the costs incurred and investments made by those system operators to comply with their obligations and not directly recovered from the connection costs and fees, insofar as the costs correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable regulated operator.
