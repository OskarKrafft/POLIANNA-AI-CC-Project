Article 45
Decision-making powers regarding the connection of production facilities for renewable gas and low-carbon gas to the distribution system
Regulatory authorities shall require the distribution system operator to publish transparent and efficient procedures for non-discriminatory connection of production facilities for renewable gas and low-carbon gas. Those procedures shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authorities. Member States may grant production facilities for biomethane priority to connect.
For the purpose of the swift implementation of grid connection of biomethane production, Member States shall endeavour to ensure that the distribution system operator complies with reasonable time limits to assess requests for the injection of biomethane, make an offer and implement the connection, under the monitoring by the regulatory authorities carried out in accordance with Article 78(1), point (t).
