Article 31
Third-party access to natural gas distribution and transmission and LNG terminals
1.   Member States shall ensure the implementation of a system of third-party access to the transmission and distribution system and LNG facilities based on published tariffs, applicable to all customers, including supply undertakings, and applied objectively and without discrimination between system users. Member States shall ensure that those tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calculation, are approved prior to their entry into force in accordance with Article 78 by a regulatory authority and that those tariffs – and the methodologies, where only methodologies are approved – are published prior to their entry into force.
2.   Transmission system operators shall, if necessary for the purpose of carrying out their functions including in relation to cross-border transmission, have access to the network of other transmission system operators.
3.   This Directive shall not prevent the conclusion of long-term contracts for renewable gas and low-carbon gas in so far as they comply with Union competition rules and contribute to decarbonisation. No long-term contracts for the supply of unabated fossil gas shall be concluded with a duration beyond 31 December 2049.
