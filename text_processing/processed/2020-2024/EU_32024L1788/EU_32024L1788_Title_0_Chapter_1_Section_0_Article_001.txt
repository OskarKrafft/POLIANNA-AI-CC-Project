Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1.   This Directive establishes a common framework for the decarbonisation of the markets for natural gas and hydrogen, in order to contribute to the achievement of the Union’s climate and energy targets.
2.   This Directive establishes common rules for the transmission, distribution, supply and storage of natural gas using the natural gas system, and consumer protection provisions, with a view to creating an integrated, competitive and transparent market for natural gas in the Union. It lays down the rules relating to the organisation and functioning of that sector, access to the market, the criteria and procedures applicable to the granting of authorisations for transmission, distribution, supply and storage of natural gas using the natural gas system and the operation of that system.
3.   This Directive establishes common rules for the transport, supply and storage of natural gas and the transition of the natural gas system towards an integrated and highly efficient system based on renewable gas and low-carbon gas.
4.   This Directive establishes common rules for the transport, supply and storage of hydrogen using the hydrogen system. It lays down rules relating to the organisation and functioning of that sector, access to the market, the criteria and procedures applicable to the granting of authorisations for networks, supply and storage of hydrogen and the operation of that system.
5.   This Directive establishes rules for the progressive establishment of a Union-wide interconnected hydrogen system contributing to the long-term flexibility of the electricity system and to the reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions of hard-to-decarbonise sectors taking into account the greenhouse gas abatement potential and the energy and cost-efficiency in relation to other options and thereby supporting the decarbonisation of the Union energy system.
