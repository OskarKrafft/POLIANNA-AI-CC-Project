Article 15
Active customers on the market for natural gas
1.   Member States shall ensure that final customers, in particular from the agricultural or public sectors, while maintaining their rights as final customers as established in this Directive, are entitled to act as active customers without being subject to disproportionate or discriminatory technical requirements, administrative requirements, procedures and charges, and to network charges that are not cost-reflective.
2.   Member States shall ensure that active customers are:
(a)
entitled to operate directly;
(b)
entitled to sell self-produced renewable natural gas using the natural gas system;
(c)
entitled to participate in energy efficiency and demand-shifting schemes;

entitled to delegate to a third party the management of the installations required for their activities, including installation, operation, data handling and maintenance, without that third party being considered to be an active customer;

financially responsible for the imbalances they cause in the natural gas system or are to delegate their balancing responsibility in accordance with Article 3, point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2024/1789.
