Article 62
Unbundling of transmission system owners, hydrogen transmission network owners, natural gas storage system operators and hydrogen storage operators
1.   Transmission system and hydrogen transmission network owners, where an independent system operator or an independent hydrogen transmission network operator has been appointed, and natural gas storage system operators or hydrogen storage operators which are part of vertically integrated undertakings shall be independent at least in terms of their legal form, organisation and decision making from other activities not relating to transmission, distribution, transport and storage of natural gas and hydrogen.
This Article shall apply only to natural gas storage facilities that are technically or economically necessary for providing efficient access to the system for the supply of customers pursuant to Article 33.
2.   In order to ensure the independence of the transmission system or hydrogen transmission network owner and natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator referred to in paragraph 1, the following minimum criteria shall apply:
(a)
persons responsible for the management of the transmission system or hydrogen transmission network owner and natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator shall not participate in company structures of the integrated natural gas undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the production and supply of natural gas and hydrogen;
(b)
appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that the professional interests of persons responsible for the management of the transmission system or hydrogen transmission network owner and natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently;
(c)
the natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator shall have effective decision-making rights, independent from the integrated natural gas undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the storage facilities; this shall not preclude the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets regulated indirectly in accordance with Article 78(7) in a subsidiary are protected; it shall enable in particular the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary; it shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to individual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of storage facilities, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument;
(d)
the transmission system or hydrogen transmission network owner and the natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator shall establish a compliance programme, which shall set out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that observance of it is adequately monitored; it shall also set out the specific obligations of employees to meet those objectives; an annual report, setting out the measures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body responsible for monitoring the compliance programme to the regulatory authority and shall be published.
3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 90 to supplement this Directive in order to set guidelines to ensure full and effective compliance of the transmission system or hydrogen transmission network owner and of the natural gas storage system operator or hydrogen storage operator with paragraph 2 of this Article.
