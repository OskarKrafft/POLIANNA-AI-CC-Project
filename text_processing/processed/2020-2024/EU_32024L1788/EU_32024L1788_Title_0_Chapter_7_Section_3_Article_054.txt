Article 54
Confidentiality for operators of hydrogen networks, hydrogen storage facilities and hydrogen terminals
1.   Without prejudice to legal duties to disclose information, each operator of a hydrogen network, hydrogen storage facility or hydrogen terminal, and each owner of a hydrogen network, shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its activities, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be commercially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. In particular, if the operator of a hydrogen network, hydrogen storage facility or hydrogen terminal, or the owner of a hydrogen network, is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall not disclose any commercially sensitive information to the remaining parts of the vertically integrated undertaking other than transmission system operators, distribution system operators or hydrogen network operators, unless this is necessary for carrying out a business transaction.
2.   The operator of a hydrogen network, hydrogen storage facility or hydrogen terminal shall not, in the context of sales or purchases of hydrogen by related undertakings, misuse commercially sensitive information obtained from third parties in the context of providing or negotiating access to the system.
3.   Information necessary for effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market shall be made public. That obligation shall be without prejudice to protecting commercially sensitive information.
