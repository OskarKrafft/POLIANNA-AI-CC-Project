(a)
a needs assessment for the development of interoperability solutions;

a list of proposed follow-up actions to innovation measures, including actions in support of open source interoperability solutions;
(d)
an identification of synergies with other relevant Union and national programmes and initiatives;
(e)
indications of available financial opportunities in support of the priorities included.
3.   The Interoperable Europe Agenda shall not impose financial obligations or further administrative burdens. After its adoption, the Commission shall publish the Interoperable Europe Agenda on the Interoperable Europe portal and shall provide regular updates on its implementation.
