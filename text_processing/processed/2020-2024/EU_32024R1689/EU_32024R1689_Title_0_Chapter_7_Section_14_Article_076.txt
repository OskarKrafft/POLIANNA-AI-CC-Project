(a)
to suspend or terminate the testing in real world conditions;
(b)
to require the provider or prospective provider and the deployer or prospective deployer to modify any aspect of the testing in real world conditions.

5.   Where applicable, where a market surveillance authority has taken a decision referred to in paragraph 3, it shall communicate the grounds therefor to the market surveillance authorities of other Member States in which the AI system has been tested in accordance with the testing plan.
