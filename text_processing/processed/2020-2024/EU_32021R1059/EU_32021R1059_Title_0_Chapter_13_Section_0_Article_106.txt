Article 45
Interreg programme authorities
1.   Member States and, where applicable, third countries, partner countries and OCTs participating in an Interreg programme shall identify, for the purposes of Article 71 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, a single managing authority and a single audit authority.
2.   The managing authority and the audit authority shall be located in the same Member State.
3.   As regards the PEACE PLUS cross-border programme, the Special EU Programmes Body, where it is identified as the managing authority, shall be considered to be located in a Member State.
4.   Member States and, where applicable, third countries, partner countries and OCTs participating in an Interreg programme may identify an EGTC as managing authority of that programme.
5.   Where the managing authority identifies one or more intermediate bodies under an Interreg programme in accordance with Article 71(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the intermediate body shall carry out those tasks in more than one participating Member State or, where applicable, in a third country, partner country or OCT. Without prejudice to Article 22 of this Regulation, one or more intermediate bodies may carry out those tasks in only one participating Member State or, where applicable, in a third country, partner country or OCT where such an approach is based on existing structures.
