For Interreg programmes, the relevant territorial authorities or bodies responsible for drawing up territorial or local development strategies as listed in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 or involved in the selection of operations to be supported under those strategies as referred to in Article 29(5) of that Regulation, or for both, shall represent at least two participating countries, of which at least one is a Member State.
