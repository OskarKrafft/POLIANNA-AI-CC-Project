Article 56
Eligibility
1.   By way of derogation from Article 63(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, expenditure shall be eligible for a contribution from external financing instruments of the Union if it has been incurred and paid in the preparation and implementation of Interreg operations from 1 January 2021 or from the date of the programme submission, whichever date is earlier, but may be claimed from the programme after the date when the financing agreement with the respective third country, partner country or OCT was concluded.
However, expenditure for technical assistance managed by programme authorities located in a Member State may already be claimed from the programme before the date when the financing agreement with the respective third country, partner country or OCT was concluded.
2.   Where an Interreg programme selects operations based on calls for proposals, such calls may include applications for a contribution from external financing instruments of the Union, even where the calls were launched and operations were selected before the relevant financing agreement was concluded.
The managing authority may provide the document provided for in Article 22(6) before the relevant financing agreement was concluded.
