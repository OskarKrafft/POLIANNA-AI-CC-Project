Article 15
Adaptation to technical progress
1.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 in order to take into account technical progress to amend this Regulation as follows:
(a)
Article 5 by introducing additional options and designations based on innovative technologies for manufacturers;
(b)
setting out special rules for small-volume manufacturers for vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 under Articles 3 and 8;
(c)
where appropriate, setting out emission limits for formaldehyde from vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 in Table 2 of Annex I, following and based on the review in accordance with Article 18(6);
(d)
Table 2 of Annex III, as regards the test conditions for vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3, based on data collected when testing ‘Euro 7’ vehicles;
(e)
Tables 4 and 5 of Annex III, as regards the test conditions, based on data collected when testing ‘Euro 7’ brakes or tyres;
(f)
setting out durability multipliers in Table 2 of Annex IV based on data collected when testing exhaust emissions of vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2 and N3 and a report on the durability of heavy duty vehicles submitted to the European Parliament and Council in accordance with Article 18(3);
(g)
Annex V, as regards the application of test requirements and declarations.
2.   Where a proposal for a UN Regulation, for a Global Technical Regulation or an amendment to a UN Regulation or to a Global Technical Regulation has been adopted and without undue delay after such adoption, or based on the reports submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council in accordance with Articles 18(4) and (5), where appropriate, taking into account technical progress, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16, amending this Regulation as follows:
(a)
setting out brake particle emission limits in Annex I in line with state-of-the art technologies and, if appropriate, referring to the work performed in the United Nations World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (UN WP.29), including, where relevant, amending Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Annex I, respectively, by providing for different limits or criteria depending on categories of vehicles and powertrain technologies;
(b)
setting out abrasion limits for tyre types in Annex I, referring to the work of the UN WP.29;
(c)
setting out the minimum performance requirements of batteries laid down in Annex II, in line with state-of-the art technologies and battery architecture as well as their application, particularly in small vehicles, and taking into account criteria such as mileage and lifetime periods for all vehicle categories in relation to battery performance.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 to amend this Regulation by setting out abrasion limits for tyre types referred to in Annex I where the UN WP.29 has not adopted uniform provisions before the relevant deadline laid down in paragraph 3 of this Article, in line with and referring to, where appropriate, the work of the UN WP.29, and taking into account technical progress, by 1 July 2027 for C1 class tyres, by 1 April 2029 for C2 class tyres and by 1 April 2031 for C3 class tyres.
3.   Where the UN WP.29 has not adopted uniform provisions by 1 July 2026 for C1 class tyres, by 1 April 2028 for C2 class tyres and by 1 April 2030 for C3 class tyres, the Commission shall develop a method for the measurement of tyre abrasion and shall define abrasion limits for tyres based on existing state-of-the-art methods.
