Article 5
Options of the manufacturers concerning the construction and designation of vehicles
1.   Manufacturers may designate vehicles as ‘Euro 7G’ vehicles where those vehicles are equipped with internal combustion engines with geofencing technologies. The manufacturer shall install on those vehicles a driver warning system to inform the user when the traction batteries are nearly empty and to stop the vehicle if not charged within 5 kilometres from the first warning while on zero-emission mode inside the geofencing area. The application of such geofencing technologies shall be demonstrated to the approval authority during type- approval and verified during the lifetime of the vehicle.
2.   At the request of the manufacturer, for vehicles of category N2 between 3,5 and 5 tonnes maximum mass originating from a type of vehicle of category N1, the approval authority may grant an emission type-approval if the vehicle meets the requirements for a type of vehicle of category N1. Such vehicles shall be designated as ‘Euro 7ext’ vehicles.
3.   Manufacturers may construct vehicles combining the characteristics referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and designate them as ‘Euro 7Gext’ vehicles.
