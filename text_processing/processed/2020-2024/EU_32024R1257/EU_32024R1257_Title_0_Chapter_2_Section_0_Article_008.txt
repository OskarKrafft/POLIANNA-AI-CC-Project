Article 8
Special rules for small-volume manufacturers
1.   As regards pollutant emissions, small-volume manufacturers may substitute tests set out in Tables 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of Annex V with declarations of compliance. The compliance of vehicles constructed and placed on the market by small-volume manufacturers may be tested for in-service conformity and market surveillance in accordance with Tables 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of Annex V. Conformity of production tests set out in Annex V shall not be required.
Article 4(6), points (b), (c) and (e), shall not apply to small-volume manufacturers of vehicles of category M1 or N1.
2.   Ultra-small-volume manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance with the emission limits set out in Annex I either on road or in laboratory tests based on real-driving cycles for in-service conformity and market surveillance purposes.
