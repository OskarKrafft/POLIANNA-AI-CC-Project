Article 7
Obligations of the manufacturers concerning emission type-approval
1.   In order to demonstrate compliance with the emission type-approval rules during emission type-approval, manufacturers shall perform the tests specified in Tables 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of Annex V. For the purpose of verifying the conformity of production with the requirements of this Regulation, vehicles, components and separate technical units shall be selected at the premises of the manufacturer by the approval authority or the manufacturer. In-service conformity shall be checked for the lifetime of the vehicle, as set out in Table 1 of Annex IV.
2.   Manufacturers shall provide the approval authority with a signed declaration of compliance as regards the RDE, CO2 ambient temperature correction, OBD and OBM systems, emissions and battery durability, continuous or periodic regeneration, anti-tampering and crankcase emissions requirements as specified in Annex V. Manufacturers shall provide to the approval authority a signed declaration of compliance on the use of the geofencing option where that option has been selected.
3.   The national authorities may test the vehicle type to verify its conformity during conformity of production, in-service conformity or market surveillance as specified in Annex V.
4.   Manufacturers shall issue an EVP for each vehicle and deliver that passport to the purchaser together with the vehicle, extracting the relevant data from sources, such as the certificate of conformity and the type-approval documentation. Manufacturers shall ensure that EVP data are available for display in the vehicle electronic systems or through a QR code, or any similar method, and that EVP data can be transmitted from on- to off- board.
5.   In the case of multi-stage type-approval, Article 13(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 shall apply to the emission type-approval, conformity of production and in-service conformity.
