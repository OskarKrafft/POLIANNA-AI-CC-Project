Special rules for vehicles with a type-approved engine
1.   In the event of approval of a type of vehicle of category M2, M3, N2 or N3 with a type-approved engine, the vehicle manufacturer shall be responsible for the emission type-approval. That obligation shall also cover the engine installation on the vehicle. Where the engine installation is in accordance with the engine installation specifications delivered by the engine manufacturer and subject to a prior agreement between the vehicle manufacturer and the engine manufacturer, the engine manufacturer can be made responsible for demonstrating compliance with the in-service conformity requirements.

The engine manufacturer shall also perform the in-service conformity related tests, where the engine manufacturer is made responsible for demonstrating compliance with the vehicle in-service conformity requirements, except for the CO2 determination for which the vehicle manufacturer remains responsible.
3.   The administrative requirements for the type-approval and in-service conformity testing of vehicles in which a type-approved engine is installed shall cover in particular the characteristics of the engine type-approval to be taken into consideration, the information to be provided by the engine manufacturer to the vehicle manufacturer and the attribution of responsibility for in-service conformity.
