it represents no more than 50 % of the net asset value of the ELTIF in the case of ELTIFs that can be marketed to retail investors, and no more than 100 % of the net asset value of the ELTIF in the case of ELTIFs marketed solely to professional investors;

(d)
it has a maturity no longer than the life of the ELTIF.
When borrowing cash, an ELTIF may encumber assets to implement its borrowing strategy.

That date shall be no later than three years after the date on which the marketing of the ELTIF commenced.

whether the creation of an optional designation of “ELTIF marketed as environmentally sustainable” or “green ELTIF” is feasible, and in particular:
