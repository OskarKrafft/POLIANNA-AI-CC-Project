2.   Notwithstanding Article 28 of Directive (EU) 2016/1629, the validity of documents falling within the scope of that Directive and issued by the competent authorities of the Member States under Directive 2006/87/EC before 6 October 2018, which, in accordance with that provision, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020, shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for a period of six months.
3.   Where a Member State considers that the renewal of Union inland navigation certificates or of documents referred to in paragraph 2 is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID‚Äê19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraphs 1 and 2, as relevant. That request may concern the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 or the periods of six months specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, or both. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 1 August 2020.
4.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 3, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the renewal of Union inland navigation certificates or of documents referred to in paragraph 2 is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
