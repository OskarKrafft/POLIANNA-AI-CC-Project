2.   Notwithstanding Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, decision on application for authorisation of regular services submitted by the carrier between 12 December 2019 and 31 August 2020 shall be taken by the authorising authority within six months of the date of the submission of the application. Notwithstanding Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the competent authorities of the Member States whose agreement has been requested in respect of such applications in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article shall notify the authorising authority of their decision on the application within three months. Where the authorising authority does not receive a reply within three months, the authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement, and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation. The extension of the time limit to three months for the Member States whose agreement has been requested under Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 shall apply to applications that have been received after 27 March 2020.
3.   Where a Member State considers that the renewal of Community licences is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID‐19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraph 1. That request may concern the periods between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 or between 12 December 2019 and 31 August 2020 or the period of six months, or any combination thereof. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 1 August 2020.
4.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 3, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraph 1, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the renewal of Community licences is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
5.   Where a Member State has not been, and is likely not to be, confronted by difficulties that rendered the renewal of Community licences impracticable during the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID‐19 outbreak, or has taken appropriate national measures to mitigate such difficulties, that Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1, after first informing the Commission. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof and shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Member State that has decided not to apply paragraph 1 as provided for in the first subparagraph shall not impede the cross‐border activities of any economic operator or individual that has relied on derogations set out in paragraph 1 that apply in another Member State.
