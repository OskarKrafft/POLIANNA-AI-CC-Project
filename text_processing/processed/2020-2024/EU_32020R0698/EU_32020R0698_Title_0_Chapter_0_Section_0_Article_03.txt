1.   Notwithstanding Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, the time limits for carrying out the periodic review of port facility security assessments which, in accordance with that provision, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended until 30 November 2020.
2.   By way of derogation from Part B, Section 13.6, of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, if drills could not have been conducted or cannot be conducted within the intervals specified therein in 2020, they shall be conducted at least twice during 2020 with a maximum interval of six months between them.
3.   Notwithstanding Part B, Sections 13.7 and 18.6, of Annex III, to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 the 18-month time limits for the carrying out of the various types of exercises which, in accordance with those provisions, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended by six months in each case, but in any event not beyond 31 December 2020.
4.   For the purposes of the requirements set out in Part B, Sections 13.7 and 18.6, of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, under which the various types of exercises are to be carried out at least once each calendar year, exercises carried out in 2021 during the period covered by an authorisation issued pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article, shall be deemed also to have been carried out in 2020.
5.   Where a Member State considers that the carrying out of port facility security assessments or of the various types of exercises referred to in Part B Sections 13.7 and 18.6, of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID‚Äê19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 3, as relevant. That request may concern the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020, the deadlines or the period of six months specified in paragraphs 1 and 3 respectively, or any combination thereof. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 1 August 2020.
6.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 5, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 3 respectively, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the carrying out of port facility security assessments or of the various types of exercises is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
