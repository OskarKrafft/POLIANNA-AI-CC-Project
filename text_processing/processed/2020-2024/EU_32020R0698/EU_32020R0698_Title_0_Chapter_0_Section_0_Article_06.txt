1.   Notwithstanding Article 6(2) of Directive 96/50/EC, the time limits for undergoing medical examinations which, in accordance with that provision, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for a period of six months. The boatmasters’ certificates of persons subject to obligation to undergo medical examinations referred to in Article 6(2) of that Directive shall remain valid accordingly.
2.   Where a Member State considers that the completion of medical examinations is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020 due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID‐19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraph 1. That request may concern the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 or the period of six months specified in paragraph 1, or both. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 1 August 2020.
3.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 2, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraph 1, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the completion of medical examinations is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
