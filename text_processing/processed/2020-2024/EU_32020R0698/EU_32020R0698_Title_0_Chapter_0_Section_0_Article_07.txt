2.   Notwithstanding Article 7(7) and Annex III of Directive 2005/65/EC, the 18-month time limits for the completion of training exercises which, in accordance with that Annex, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended by six months in each case, but in any event not beyond 30 November 2020.
3.   For the purposes of the requirement set out in Annex III to Directive 2005/65/EC, according to which training exercises are to be carried out at least once each calendar year, training exercises carried out in 2021 during the period covered by an authorisation issued pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article, shall be deemed also to have been carried out in 2020.
4.   Where a Member State considers that the carrying out of the review of port security assessments or port security plans or the carrying out of training exercises is likely to remain impracticable beyond 31 August 2020, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID‚Äê19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2, as relevant. That request may concern the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020, the deadlines or the periods of six months specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, or any combination thereof. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 1 August 2020.
5.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 4, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are met, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the completion of the review of port security assessments or port security plans or the completion of training is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
