‘Article 7a

Peak-shaving product
1.   Where a regional or Union-wide electricity price crisis is declared in accordance with Article 66a of Directive (EU) 2019/944, Member States may request system operators to propose the procurement of peak-shaving products in order to achieve a reduction of electricity demand during peak hours. Such procurement shall be limited to the duration set out in the implementing decision adopted pursuant to Article 66a(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/944.
2.   Where a request is made pursuant to paragraph 1, system operators shall, after consulting stakeholders, submit a proposal setting out the dimensioning and conditions for the procurement and activation of the peak-shaving product to the regulatory authority of the Member State concerned for its approval.
3.   The regulatory authority concerned shall assess the proposal for a peak-shaving product referred to in paragraph 2 as regards achieving a reduction of electricity demand and the impact on wholesale electricity price during peak hours. That assessment shall take into account the need for the peak-shaving product not to unduly distort the functioning of the electricity markets, and not to cause a redirection of demand response services towards peak-shaving products. On the basis of that assessment, the regulatory authority may request the system operator to amend its proposal.
4.   The proposal for a peak-shaving product referred to in paragraph 2 shall comply with the following requirements:
(a)
the dimensioning of the peak-shaving product shall:
(i)
be based on an analysis of the need for an additional service to ensure security of supply without endangering grid stability, of its impact on the market and of its expected costs and benefits;
(ii)
take into account the forecast of demand, the forecast of electricity generated from renewable energy, the forecast of other sources of flexibility in the system, such as energy storage, and the wholesale price impact of the avoided dispatch; and
(iii)
be limited to ensure that forecasted costs do not exceed the expected benefits of the peak-shaving product;
(b)
the procurement of a peak-shaving product shall be based on objective, transparent, market-based and non-discriminatory criteria, shall be limited to demand response and shall not exclude participating assets from accessing other markets;
(c)
the procurement of the peak-shaving product shall take place using competitive bidding, which can be continuous, with selection based on the lowest cost of meeting pre-defined technical and environmental criteria and shall allow the effective participation of consumers, directly or through aggregation;
(d)
the minimum bid size shall not be higher than 100 kW, including through aggregation;
(e)
contracts for a peak-shaving product shall not be concluded more than a week before its activation;
(f)
the activation of the peak-shaving product shall not reduce cross-zonal capacity;
(g)
the activation of the peak-shaving product shall take place before or within the day-ahead market time frame and may be done on the basis of a pre-defined electricity price;
(h)
the activation of the peak-shaving product shall not imply starting fossil fuel-based generation located behind the metering point, in order to avoid increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
5.   The actual reduction of consumption resulting from the activation of a peak-shaving product shall be measured against a baseline, reflecting the expected electricity consumption without the activation of the peak-shaving product. Where a system operator procures a peak-shaving product, that operator shall develop a baseline methodology after consulting market participants, shall, where relevant, take into account the implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 59(1), point (e), and shall submit it to the regulatory authority concerned for its approval.
6.   The regulatory authority concerned shall approve the proposal of the system operators seeking to procure a peak-shaving product and the baseline methodology submitted in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 5 or shall request the system operators to amend the proposal or the baseline methodology where that proposal or that methodology does not meet the requirements laid down in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5.
7.   By six months after the end of a regional or Union-wide electricity price crisis as referred to in paragraph 1, ACER shall, after consulting stakeholders, assess the impact of using peak-shaving products on the Union electricity market. That assessment shall take into account the need for peak-shaving products not to unduly distort the functioning of the electricity markets, and not to cause a redirection of demand response services towards peak-shaving products. ACER may issue recommendations that regulatory authorities shall take into account in their assessment pursuant to paragraph 3.
8.   By 30 June 2025, ACER shall, after consulting stakeholders, assess the impact of developing peak-shaving products on the Union electricity market under normal market circumstances. That assessment shall take into account the need for peak-shaving products not to unduly distort the functioning of the electricity markets, and not to cause a redirection of demand response services towards peak-shaving products. On the basis of that assessment, the Commission may submit a legislative proposal to amend this Regulation in order to introduce peak-shaving products outside regional or Union-wide electricity price crisis situations.
Article 7b
Dedicated measurement device
1.   Without prejudice to Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, transmission system operators, distribution system operators and relevant market participants, including independent aggregators, may use, upon the consent of the final customer, data from dedicated measurement devices for the observability and settlement of demand response and flexibility services, including from energy storage facilities.

SPECIFIC INVESTMENT INCENTIVES TO ACHIEVE THE UNION’S DECARBONISATION OBJECTIVES

Article 19a
Power purchase agreements
1.   Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Member States shall promote the uptake of PPAs, including by removing unjustified barriers and disproportionate or discriminatory procedures or charges, with a view to providing price predictability and reaching the objectives set out in their integrated national energy and climate plans with respect to the decarbonisation dimension referred to in Article 4, point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, including with respect to renewable energy, while preserving competitive and liquid electricity markets and cross-border trade.
2.   When carrying out the review of this Regulation in accordance with Article 69(2), the Commission, after consulting relevant stakeholders, shall assess the potential and viability of one or several Union market platforms for PPAs, to be used on a voluntary basis, including the interaction of those potential platforms with other existing electricity market platforms and the pooling of demand for PPAs through aggregation.
3.   Member States shall ensure, in a coordinated manner, that instruments, such as guarantee schemes at market prices, to reduce the financial risks associated to offtaker payment default in the framework of PPAs are in place and accessible to customers that face entry barriers to the PPA market and that are not in financial difficulty. Such instruments may include, inter alia, state-backed guarantee schemes at market prices, private guarantees, or facilities pooling demand for PPAs, in accordance with relevant Union law. To that end, Member States shall ensure appropriate coordination, including with relevant Union-level facilities. Member States may determine the categories of customers that are targeted by those instruments, applying non-discriminatory criteria between and within the categories of customers.
4.   Without prejudice to Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, if a guarantee scheme for PPAs is backed by the Member State, it shall include provisions to avoid lowering the liquidity in electricity markets and shall not provide support to the purchase of generation from fossil fuels. Member States may decide to limit those guarantee schemes to the exclusive support of the purchase of electricity from new renewable energy generation in accordance with the Member State’s decarbonisation policies, including in particular where the market for renewables PPAs as defined in Article 2, point (17), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 is not sufficiently developed.
5.   Support schemes for electricity from renewable sources shall allow the participation of projects which reserve part of the electricity for sale through a renewable PPA or other market-based arrangements, provided that such participation does not negatively affect competition in the market, in particular where the two parties involved in that PPA are controlled by the same entity.
6.   In the design of the support schemes referred to in paragraph 5, Member States shall endeavour to make use of evaluation criteria to incentivise bidders to facilitate the access of customers that face entry barriers to the PPA market, provided that this does not negatively affect competition in the market.
7.   PPAs shall specify the bidding zone of delivery and the responsibility for securing cross-zonal transmission rights in the case of a change of bidding zone in accordance with Article 14.
8.   PPAs shall specify the terms and conditions under which customers and producers may exit from PPAs, such as any applicable exit fees and notice periods, in accordance with Union competition law.
9.   Member States, when designing measures directly affecting PPAs, shall respect possible legitimate expectations and shall take into account the effect of those measures on existing and future PPAs.
10.   By 31 January 2026 and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall assess whether barriers persist, and whether there is sufficient transparency, in the PPA markets. The Commission may draw up specific guidance on removal of barriers in the PPA markets, including disproportionate or discriminatory procedures or charges.
Article 19b
Voluntary templates for PPAs and monitoring of PPAs
1.   ACER shall publish an annual assessment on the PPA market at Union and Member State level as part of its annual report published pursuant to Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/942.
2.   By 17 October 2024, ACER shall assess, in close coordination with the relevant institutions and stakeholders, the need to develop and issue voluntary templates for PPAs, adapted to the needs of the different categories of counterparties.
Where the assessment concludes that there is a need to develop and issue such voluntary templates for PPAs, ACER, together with the NEMOs, and after consulting the relevant stakeholders, shall develop such templates, taking into account the following:
(a)
the use of those contract templates shall be voluntary for the contracting parties;
(b)
the contract templates shall, inter alia:
(i)
offer a variety of contract durations;
(ii)
provide a variety of price formulas;
(iii)
consider the offtaker’s load profile and the generator’s generation profile.
Article 19c
Measures at Union level to contribute to the achievement of the additional share of energy from renewable sources
The Commission shall assess whether measures at Union level can contribute to the achievement of the Member States collective endeavour of an additional 2,5 % share of energy from renewable sources in the Union’s gross final consumption of energy in 2030 pursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/2001, complementing national measures. The Commission shall analyse the possibility to use the Union renewable energy financing mechanism established pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 to organise Union-level renewable energy auctions in line with the relevant regulatory framework.
Article 19d
Direct price support schemes in the form of two-way contracts for difference for investment
1.   Direct price support schemes for investment in new power-generating facilities for the generation of electricity from the sources listed in paragraph 4 shall take the form of two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects.
