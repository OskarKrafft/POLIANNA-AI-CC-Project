Article 1
Subject matter
1.   This Directive promotes the improvement of the energy performance of buildings and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings within the Union, with a view to achieving a zero-emission building stock by 2050, taking into account the outdoor climatic conditions, the local conditions, the requirements for indoor environmental quality, and cost-effectiveness.
2.   This Directive lays down requirements as regards:
(a)
the common general framework for a methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings and building units;
(b)
the application of minimum energy performance requirements to new buildings and new building units;
(c)
the application of minimum energy performance requirements to:
(i)
existing buildings and existing building units that are undergoing major renovation;
(ii)
building elements that form part of the building envelope and that have a significant impact on the energy performance of the building envelope when they are retrofitted or replaced;
(iii)
technical building systems where they are installed, replaced or upgraded;
(d)
the application of minimum energy performance standards to existing buildings and existing building units, in accordance with Articles 3 and 9;
(e)
the calculation and disclosure of the life-cycle global warming potential of buildings;
(f)
solar energy in buildings;
(g)
renovation passports;
(h)
national building renovation plans;
(i)
sustainable mobility infrastructure in and adjacent to buildings;
(j)
smart buildings;
(k)
energy performance certification of buildings or building units;
(l)
regular inspection of heating systems, ventilation systems and air-conditioning systems in buildings;
(m)
independent control systems for energy performance certificates, renovation passports, smart readiness indicators and inspection reports;
(n)
the indoor environmental quality performance of buildings.
3.   The requirements laid down in this Directive are minimum requirements and shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent measures, provided that such measures are compatible with Union law. Those measures shall be notified to the Commission.
