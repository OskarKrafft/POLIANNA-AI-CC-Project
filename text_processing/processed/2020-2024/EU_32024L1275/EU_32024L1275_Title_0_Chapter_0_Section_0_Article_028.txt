Article 28
Review
The Commission, assisted by the Committee referred to in Article 33, shall review this Directive by 31 December 2028, in light of the experience gained and progress made during its application, and, if necessary, make proposals.
As part of that review, the Commission shall assess whether the application of this Directive in combination with other legislative instruments addressing energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, in particular through carbon pricing, deliver sufficient progress towards achieving a fully decarbonised, zero-emission building stock by 2050, or whether further binding measures at Union level, in particular mandatory minimum energy performance standards across the whole building stock, need to be introduced, including in order to ensure that the values for 2030 and 2035 set out in Article 9(2) can be achieved. The Commission shall also assess the national roadmaps and in particular the planned limit values for the life-cycle GWP of new buildings pursuant to Article 7(4) and shall consider whether additional measures promoting a sustainable built environment are needed. The Commission shall also examine in what manner Member States could apply integrated district or neighbourhood approaches in Union building and energy efficiency policy, while ensuring that each building meets the minimum energy performance requirements, for example by means of integrated renovation programmes and overall renovation schemes applying to a number of buildings in a spatial context instead of a single building. The Commission shall also assess whether alternative indicators, such as final energy use and energy needs would be better suited for the purposes of Annex I.
