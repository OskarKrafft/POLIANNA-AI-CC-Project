Article 24
Reports on the inspection of heating systems, ventilation systems and air-conditioning systems
1.   An inspection report shall be issued after each inspection of a heating system, ventilation system or air-conditioning system. The inspection report shall contain the result of the inspection performed in accordance with Article 23 and include recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of the energy performance of the inspected system.
Those recommendations may be based on a comparison of the energy performance of the system inspected with that of the best available feasible system, using energy-saving technologies, and a system of similar type for which all relevant components achieve the level of energy performance required by the applicable law. The recommendations shall, where relevant, include the results from the basic assessment of the feasibility to reduce on-site use of fossil fuels.
The inspection report shall indicate any safety issue that was detected during inspection. However, the author of the report shall not be considered to be liable in relation to the detection or indication of any such safety issues.
2.   The inspection report shall be handed over to the owner or tenant of the building or building unit.
3.   The inspection report shall be uploaded into the national database for the energy performance of buildings pursuant to Article 22.
