Article 12
Renovation passport
1.   By 29 May 2026, Member States shall introduce a scheme for renovation passports based on the common framework set out in Annex VIII.
2.   The scheme referred to in paragraph 1 shall be of voluntary use by owners of buildings and building units, unless the Member State decides to make it mandatory.
Member States shall take measures to ensure that renovation passports are affordable and shall consider whether to provide financial support to vulnerable households wishing to renovate their buildings.
3.   Member States may allow for the renovation passport to be drawn up and issued jointly with the energy performance certificate.
4.   The renovation passport shall be issued in a digital format suitable for printing, by a qualified or certified expert, following an on-site visit.
5.   When the renovation passport is issued, a discussion with the expert referred to in paragraph 4 shall be suggested to the building owner to allow the expert to explain the best steps by which to transform the building into a zero-emission building well before 2050.
6.   Member States shall strive to provide a dedicated digital tool by means of which to prepare and, where appropriate, update the renovation passport. Member States may develop a complementary tool allowing building owners and building managers to simulate a draft simplified renovation passport and for them to update it once a renovation takes place or a building element is replaced.
7.   Member States shall ensure that the renovation passport can be uploaded to the national database for the energy performance of buildings set up pursuant to Article 22.
8.   Member States shall ensure that the renovation passport is stored in, or can be accessed via, where available, the digital building logbook.
