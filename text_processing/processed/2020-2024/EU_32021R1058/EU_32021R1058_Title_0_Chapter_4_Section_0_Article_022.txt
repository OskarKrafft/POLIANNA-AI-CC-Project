(a)
for Member States whose gross national income (GNI) per capita is below 60 % of the EU average GNI per capita, or for Member States whose GNI per capita is below 90 % of the EU average GNI per capita and which have a share of solid fossil fuels in gross inland energy consumption equal to or above 25 %, the limit shall be 1,55 %;
(b)
for Member States other than those in point (a) whose GNI per capita is below 90 % of the EU average GNI per capita, the limit shall be 1 %;

3.   For the purposes of this Article, the gross national income per capita of a given Member State shall be measured in purchasing power standards and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period from 2015 to 2017, and expressed as a percentage of the national income per capita in purchasing power standards of the 27 Member States for that same reference period.
For the purposes of this Article, the share of solid fossil fuels in energy consumption means the share of coal, lignite, peat and oil shale measured in 2018.
4.   Operations supported by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund under points (h)(i) and (h)(ii) of paragraph 1 shall be selected by the managing authority by 31 December 2025. Such operations shall not be phased to the next programming period.
5.   The Cohesion Fund shall not support investment in housing unless related to the promotion of energy efficiency or renewable energy use.
6.   Overseas countries and territories shall not be eligible for support from the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund, but may participate in Interreg programmes in accordance with the conditions set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1059 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).
