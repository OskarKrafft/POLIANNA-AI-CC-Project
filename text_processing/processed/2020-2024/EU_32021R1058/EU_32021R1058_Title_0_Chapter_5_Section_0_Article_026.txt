Article 11
Sustainable urban development
1.   To address economic, environmental, climate, demographic and social challenges, the ERDF shall support integrated territorial development based on territorial or community-led local development strategies in accordance with Article 29 or 32 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, respectively, that are focused on urban areas, including functional urban areas (‘sustainable urban development’) within programmes under both goals referred to in Article 5(2) of that Regulation.
Special attention shall be given to tackling environmental and climate challenges, in particular the transition towards a climate-neutral economy by 2050, to harnessing the potential of digital technologies for innovation purposes, and to support the development of functional urban areas. In this context, sustainable urban development resources programmed under priorities corresponding to PO 1 and 2 shall count towards the thematic concentration requirements under Article 4.
2.   At least 8 % of the ERDF resources at national level under the Investment for jobs and growth goal, other than for technical assistance, shall be allocated to sustainable urban development in one or more of the forms referred to in Article 28 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.
The relevant territorial authorities or bodies shall select or shall be involved in the selection of operations in accordance with Article 29(3) and point (d) of Article 32(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.
The programmes concerned shall set out the planned amounts for that purpose under point (d)(viii) of Article 22(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.
3.   The percentage allocated to sustainable urban development under paragraph 2 of this Article shall be complied with throughout the entire programming period when ERDF allocations are transferred between priorities of a programme or between programmes, including at the mid-term review in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.
4.   Where the ERDF allocation is reduced following a decommitment under Article 105 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, or due to financial corrections by the Commission in accordance with Article 104 of that Regulation, compliance with paragraph 2 of this Article shall not be re-assessed.
