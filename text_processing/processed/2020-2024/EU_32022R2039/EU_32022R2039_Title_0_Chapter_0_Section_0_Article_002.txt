                              ‘An additional 0,5 % pre-financing shall be paid in 2022 immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation and an additional 0,5 % pre-financing shall be paid in 2023 for programmes supported by the ERDF, ESF+ or the Cohesion Fund under the Investment for jobs and growth goal. Where a programme is adopted after 31 December 2022, the 2022 instalment shall be paid in the year of adoption.’;

in Article 90(5), the first subparagraph is replaced with the following:
‘5.   The amount paid as pre-financing for the years 2021 and 2022, with the exception of the additional pre-financing referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article, shall be cleared from the Commission accounts each year. All other amounts paid as pre-financing shall be cleared from the Commission accounts no later than with the final accounting year in accordance with Article 100.’;
(3)
in Article 112, the following paragraph is added:
‘7.   Where a separate priority is established within a programme to support operations promoting the socioeconomic integration of third country nationals, a co-financing rate of up to 100 % shall be applied to expenditure declared in payment applications until the end of the accounting year ending on 30 June 2024. After that date, the co-financing rate set out in the programme in accordance with the maximum co-financing rates listed under paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply.
The total amount programmed under such priorities in a Member State shall not exceed 5 % of the initial national allocation from the ERDF and the ESF+ combined.
The Commission shall review the co-financing rate by 30 June 2024.
At least 30 % of the financial allocation of such a separate priority shall be attributed to operations which have beneficiaries that are local authorities or civil society organisations operating in local communities. Member States shall report on the fulfilment of that condition in the final performance report required under Article 43. Where that condition is not fulfilled, reimbursement by the Commission under the priority concerned shall be reduced proportionately to ensure that that condition is respected when calculating the final balance to be paid to the programme.’;
