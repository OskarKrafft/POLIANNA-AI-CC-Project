Article 25
Monitoring and reporting
1.   Measurable indicators to monitor the implementation and to report on the progress of the Programme towards the achievement of the specific objectives laid down in Article 3(2) are set out in Annex II.
2.   The Commission shall establish a methodology to provide for indicators for accurately assessing progress made towards the achievement of the general objectives laid down in Article 3(1).
3.   In order to ensure the effective assessment of the Programme’s progress towards the achievement of its objectives, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 30 to amend Annex II with regard to the measurable indicators, where considered to be necessary, as well as to supplement this Regulation with provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework.
4.   The performance reporting system shall ensure that data for monitoring the implementation and the results of the Programme are collected efficiently, effectively, and in a timely manner so that the results are suitable for an in-depth analysis of the progress achieved and the difficulties encountered.
To that end, proportionate reporting requirements shall be imposed on recipients of Union funds and, where necessary, on Member States.
5.   Official EU statistics, such as regular ICT statistical surveys, shall be used to their maximum as context indicators. The Commission shall consult national statistical institutes and shall involve them, together with Eurostat, in the initial design and subsequent development of statistical indicators used for monitoring the implementation of the Programme and progress made with regard to digital transformation.
