Article 13
Synergies with other Union programmes
1.   The Programme shall enable synergies with other Union programmes, as described in Annex III, in particular through arrangements for complementary funding from Union programmes where the management arrangements allow it. Funding from other programmes may be deployed in sequence, in an alternating way, or through the combination of funds, including the joint funding of actions. The Commission shall ensure that the achievement of the specific objectives is not hampered when leveraging the complementary character of the Programme with other Union programmes.
2.   The Commission shall ensure the overall consistency and complementarity of the Programme with the relevant policies and Union programmes in cooperation with the Member States. To that end, the Commission shall facilitate the setting up of appropriate mechanisms for coordination between relevant authorities and between such authorities and the Commission, and shall establish appropriate monitoring tools to systematically ensure synergies between the Programme and any relevant Union funding instruments. The arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 shall contribute to avoiding duplications and to maximising the positive impact of expenditure.
