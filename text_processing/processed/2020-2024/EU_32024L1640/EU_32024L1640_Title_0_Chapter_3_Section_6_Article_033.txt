Article 33
Use by FIUs of information exchanged between them
Information and documents received pursuant to Articles 29, 31 and 32 shall be used for the accomplishment of the FIU’s tasks as laid down in this Directive. When exchanging information and documents pursuant to Articles 29 and 31, the transmitting FIU may impose restrictions and conditions for the use of that information, except where the transmission consists of a report submitted by an obliged entity pursuant to Article 69(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/1624, or information derived therefrom, which concerns another Member State where the obliged entity operates through the freedom to provide services and which includes no link to the Member State of the transmitting FIU. The receiving FIU shall comply with those restrictions and conditions.
Member States shall ensure that FIUs designate at least one contact person or point to be responsible for receiving requests for information from FIUs in other Member States.
