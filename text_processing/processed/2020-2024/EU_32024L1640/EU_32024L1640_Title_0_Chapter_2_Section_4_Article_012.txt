Member States shall notify the Commission of any change or addition to the categories referred to in the first subparagraph without delay, and in any case within 1 month of its occurrence.
The Commission shall make the information received pursuant to this paragraph available to the other Member States.
4.   Member States shall ensure that the central registers keep records of the persons accessing the information pursuant to this Article and are able to disclose them to the beneficial owners when they file a request pursuant to Article 15(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
However, Member States shall ensure that the information provided by central registers does not lead to the identification of any person consulting the register where such persons are:

For the purposes of the third subparagraph, when requesting access to beneficial ownership information pursuant to this Article, the authorities shall indicate the period for which they request the central registers to refrain from disclosure, which shall not exceed 5 years, and the reasons for that restriction, including how the provision of the information would jeopardise the purpose of their analyses and investigations. Member States shall ensure that, where central registers do not disclose the identity of the entity having consulted the beneficial ownership information, any extension of that period shall only be granted on the basis of a justified request by the authority in the third country, for a maximum period of 1 year, after which a new justified request for extension shall be submitted by that authority.
