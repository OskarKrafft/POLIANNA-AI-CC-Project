weaknesses in the internal policies, procedures and controls of the obliged entity that are likely to result in breaches of the requirements referred to in point (a) and administrative measures can prevent the occurrence of those breaches or reduce the risk thereof;

that the obliged entity has internal policies, procedures and controls that are not commensurate with the risks of money laundering, its predicate offences or terrorist financing to which the entity is exposed.

order obliged entities to comply, including to implement specific corrective measures;

restrict or limit the business, operations or network of institutions comprising the obliged entity, or to require the divestment of activities;

require the reinforcement of the internal policies, procedures and controls;
(c)
require the obliged entity to apply a specific policy or requirements relating to categories of or individual clients, transactions, activities or delivery channels that pose high risks;

(e)
impose a temporary ban against any person discharging managerial responsibilities in an obliged entity, or any other natural person who has been held responsible for the breach from exercising managerial functions in obliged entities.
4.   The administrative measures referred to in paragraph 2 shall be accompanied, where relevant, by binding deadlines for their implementation. Member States shall ensure that supervisors follow up and assess the implementation by the obliged entity of the actions requested.
