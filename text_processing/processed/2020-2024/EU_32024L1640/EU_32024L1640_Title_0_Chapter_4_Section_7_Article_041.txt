Article 41
Central contact points
1.   For the purposes of Article 37(1) and Article 38(1), Member States may require electronic money issuers, payment service providers and crypto-asset service providers operating establishments in their territory other than a subsidiary or a branch, or operating in their territory through agents or distributors, or through other types of infrastructure, under the freedom to provide services, to appoint a central contact point in their territory. That central contact point shall ensure, on behalf of the obliged entity, compliance with AML/CFT rules and shall facilitate supervision by supervisors, including by providing supervisors with documents and information on request.
2.   By 10 July 2026, AMLA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards and submit them to the Commission for adoption. Those draft regulatory technical standards shall set out the criteria for determining the circumstances in which the appointment of a central contact point pursuant to paragraph 1 is appropriate, and the functions of the central contact points.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 49 to 52 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1620.
