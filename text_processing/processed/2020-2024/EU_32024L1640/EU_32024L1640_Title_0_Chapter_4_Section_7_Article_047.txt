1.   Where obliged entities that are not part of a group carry out cross-border activities as referred to in Article 54(1) and supervision is shared between the supervisors of the home and host Member States pursuant to Articles 37(1) and 38(1), Member States shall ensure that those supervisors cooperate with each other to the greatest extent possible and assist each other in the performance of supervision pursuant to Articles 37(1) and 38(1).
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, and except in cases where AML/CFT supervisory colleges are set up in accordance with Article 49, Member States shall ensure that supervisors:
(a)
provide one another with any information they require for the exercise of their supervisory tasks, whether on request or on their own initiative, including the information referred to in Article 46(3), first subparagraph, points (a), (b) and (d), where that information is necessary for the performance of supervisory tasks;
(b)
inform one another of any adverse development in relation to the obliged entity, its establishments or types of infrastructure, which could seriously affect the entity’s compliance with applicable requirements, and pecuniary sanctions they intend to impose, or administrative measures they intend to apply in accordance with Section 4 of this Chapter;
(c)
are able to conduct, within their powers, inquiries on behalf of a requesting supervisor, and to share the information obtained through such inquiries, or to facilitate the conduct of such inquiries by the requesting supervisor.
This paragraph shall also apply in the case of obliged entities that are established in a single Member State and operate under the freedom to provide services in another Member State without any infrastructure, where the supervision of activities in that other Member State is carried out by the supervisors of that Member State pursuant to Article 37(1), second subparagraph.
2.   Where supervision of the obliged entity and any of its types of infrastructure in other Member States is entrusted to the supervisors of the home Member State pursuant to Article 38(2), Member States shall ensure that the supervisors of the home Member State inform regularly the supervisors of the host Member State of the measures in place within the obliged entity, and compliance of that entity with applicable requirements, including those in place in the host Member State. Where serious, repeated or systematic breaches are identified, the supervisors of the home Member State shall promptly inform the supervisors of the host Member State of those breaches and of any pecuniary sanctions they intend to impose and administrative measures they intend to apply to remedy them.
Member States shall ensure that supervisors of the host Member State provide assistance to the supervisors of the home Member State to ensure the verification of compliance by the obliged entity with legal requirements. In particular, Member States shall ensure that supervisors of the host Member State inform the supervisors of the home Member State of any serious doubts that they have regarding compliance of the obliged entity with applicable requirements, and that they share any information they hold in this regard with the supervisors of the home Member State.
This paragraph shall also apply in the case of obliged entities that are established in a single Member State and operate under the freedom to provide services in another Member State without any infrastructure, except for cases where the supervision of activities in that other Member State is carried out by the supervisors of that other Member State pursuant to Article 37(1), second subparagraph.
3.   Supervisors shall be able to refer to AMLA any of the following situations:
