Article 8
Evaluation of the STEP
1.   By 31 December 2025, the Commission shall provide the European Parliament and the Council with an interim evaluation report on the implementation of the STEP, for the purpose of informing future decision-making.
2.   The interim evaluation report shall, in particular, assess to which extent the objectives of the STEP have been achieved, the efficiency of the use of the resources and its European added value.
The interim evaluation report shall also:
(a)
provide an overview of the Union regions for which the cohesion programmes have been amended in compliance with the partnership principle;
(b)
consider the relevance of the STEP objectives and actions, including the critical technologies supported by the STEP;
(c)
assess the feasibility of providing information on Union programmes in a single Union portal, to bring all Union funding opportunities closer to potential beneficiaries and enhance their transparency towards Union citizens; and
(d)
assess the feasibility of setting up a simulator to provide project promoters, especially SMEs, with guidance on the Union funding opportunities for which their particular project might be eligible.
3.   Where appropriate, the interim evaluation report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal for an amendment of this Regulation with the aim of reducing the Union’s strategic dependencies and strengthening Union industrial policy, while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, avoiding market distortions and creating a level playing field in the Union, or by legislative proposals for other initiatives that pursue similar objectives.
4.   At the end of the implementation of the Union programmes by which the STEP is financially supported, but no later than 31 December 2031, the Commission shall provide the European Parliament and the Council with a final evaluation report on the implementation of the STEP, building on all elements included in the interim evaluation report and summarising the elements provided in the annual reports referred to in Article 7.
