1.   By 31 May of each year, and for the first time in 2027 for the year 2026, the authorised CBAM declarant shall surrender via the CBAM registry a number of CBAM certificates that corresponds to the embedded emissions declared in accordance with Article 6(2), point (c), and verified in accordance with Article 8, for the calendar year preceding the surrender. The Commission shall remove surrendered CBAM certificates from the CBAM registry. The authorised CBAM declarant shall ensure that the required number of CBAM certificates is available on its account in the CBAM registry.
2.   The authorised CBAM declarant shall ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on its account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the embedded emissions, determined by reference to default values in accordance with the methods set out in Annex IV, in all goods it has imported since the beginning of the calendar year.
3.   Where the Commission finds that the number of CBAM certificates in the account of an authorised CBAM declarant does not comply with the obligations pursuant to paragraph 2, it shall inform, via the CBAM registry, the competent authority of the Member State where the authorised CBAM declarant is established.
The competent authority shall notify the authorised CBAM declarant of the need to ensure a sufficient number of CBAM certificates in its account within one month of such notification.
The competent authority shall register the notification to, and the response from, the authorised CBAM declarant in the CBAM registry.
