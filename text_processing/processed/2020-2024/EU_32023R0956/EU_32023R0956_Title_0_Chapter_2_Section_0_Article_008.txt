Article 8
Verification of embedded emissions
1.   The authorised CBAM declarant shall ensure that the total embedded emissions declared in the CBAM declaration submitted pursuant to Article 6 are verified by a verifier accredited pursuant to Article 18, based on the verification principles set out in Annex VI.
2.   For embedded emissions in goods produced in installations in a third country registered in accordance with Article 10, the authorised CBAM declarant may choose to use verified information disclosed to it in accordance with Article 10(7) to fulfil the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt implementing acts for the application of the verification principles set out in Annex VI as regards:
(a)
the possibility to waive, in duly justified circumstances and without putting at risk a reliable estimation of the embedded emissions, the obligation for the verifier to visit the installation where relevant goods are produced;
(b)
the definition of thresholds for deciding whether misstatements or non-conformities are material; and
(c)
the supporting documentation needed for the verification report, including its format.
Where it adopts the implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall seek equivalence and coherence with the procedures set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 29(2) of this Regulation.
