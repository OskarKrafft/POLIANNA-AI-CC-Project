Article 1
Subject matter
1.   This Regulation establishes a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) to address greenhouse gas emissions embedded in the goods listed in Annex I on their importation into the customs territory of the Union in order to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, thereby reducing global carbon emissions and supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement, also by creating incentives for the reduction of emissions by operators in third countries.
2.   The CBAM complements the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union established under Directive 2003/87/EC (the ‘EU ETS’) by applying an equivalent set of rules to imports into the customs territory of the Union of the goods referred to in Article 2 of this Regulation.
3.   The CBAM is set to replace the mechanisms established under Directive 2003/87/EC to prevent the risk of carbon leakage by reflecting the extent to which EU ETS allowances are allocated free of charge in accordance with Article 10a of that Directive.
