2.   The CBAM report shall include the following information:
(a)
the total quantity of each type of goods, expressed in megawatt-hours for electricity and in tonnes for other goods, specified for each installation producing the goods in the country of origin;
(b)
the actual total embedded emissions, expressed in tonnes of CO2e emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity or for other goods in tonnes of CO2e emissions per tonne of each type of goods, calculated in accordance with the method set out in Annex IV;
(c)
the total indirect emissions calculated in accordance with the implementing act referred to in paragraph 7;
(d)

3.   The Commission shall periodically communicate to the relevant competent authorities a list of those importers or indirect customs representatives established in the Member State, including the corresponding justifications, which it has reasons to believe have failed to comply with the obligation to submit a CBAM report in accordance with paragraph 1.
4.   Where the Commission considers that a CBAM report is incomplete or incorrect, it shall communicate to the competent authority of the Member State where the importer is established or, in the situations covered by Article 32, the indirect customs representative is established, the additional information it considers necessary to complete or correct that report. Such information shall be provided for indicative purposes and without prejudice to the definitive appreciation by that competent authority. That competent authority shall initiate the correction procedure and notify the importer or, in the situations covered by Article 32, the indirect customs representative of the additional information necessary to correct that report. Where appropriate, that importer or that indirect customs representative shall submit a corrected report to the competent authority concerned and to the Commission.
5.   Where the competent authority of the Member State referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article initiates a correction procedure, including in consideration of information received in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article, and determines that the importer or, where applicable in accordance with Article 32, the indirect customs representative has not taken the necessary steps to correct the CBAM report, or where the competent authority concerned determines, including in consideration of information received in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, that the importer or, where applicable in accordance with Article 32, the indirect customs representative has failed to comply with the obligation to submit a CBAM report in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, that competent authority shall impose an effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalty on the importer or, where applicable in accordance with Article 32, the indirect customs representative. To that end, the competent authority shall notify the importer or, where applicable in accordance with Article 32, the indirect customs representative and inform the Commission, of the following:
