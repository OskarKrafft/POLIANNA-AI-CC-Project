in Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:
‘1.   The assistance shall take the form of a financial contribution from the Fund. For each eligible disaster or emergency, a single financial contribution shall be awarded to an eligible State.
2.   The aim of the Fund is to complement the efforts of the States concerned and to cover part of their public expenditure in order to help the eligible State to carry out, depending on the type of eligible disaster or emergency, the following essential emergency and recovery operations:
(a)
restoring the working order of infrastructure and plant in the fields of energy, water and waste water, telecommunications, transport, health and education;
(b)
providing temporary accommodation and funding rescue services to meet the needs of the population concerned;
(c)
securing preventive infrastructure and measures of protection of cultural heritage;
(d)
cleaning up disaster-stricken areas, including natural zones, in line with, where appropriate, eco-system based approaches, as well as immediate restoration of affected natural zones to avoid immediate effects from soil erosion;
(e)
measures aiming at rapidly providing assistance, including medical, to the population affected by a major public health emergency and to protect the population from the risk of being affected, including prevention, monitoring or control of the spread of diseases, combating severe risks to public health or mitigating their impact on public health.
For the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, “restoring the working order” means restoring infrastructure and plant to their condition prior to the occurrence of the natural disaster. Where it is not legally possible or economically justified to restore the condition prior to the occurrence of the natural disaster, or where the beneficiary State decides to relocate or improve the functionality of the infrastructure or plant affected in order to improve its capacity to withstand future natural disasters, the Fund may contribute to the cost of restoration only up to the estimated cost of returning to its status quo ante.
Costs in excess of the level of cost referred to in the second subparagraph shall be financed by the beneficiary State from its own or, where possible, from other Union funds.
For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, “temporary accommodation” means accommodation that lasts until the population concerned is able to return to their original homes following their repair or reconstruction.’;
