in Article 8, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
‘3.   No later than six months after the expiry of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph 1, the beneficiary State shall present a report on the implementation of the financial contribution from the Fund with a statement justifying the expenditure, indicating any other source of funding received for the operations concerned, including insurance settlements and compensation from third parties.
The implementation report shall set out, depending on the nature of the eligible disaster or emergency:
(a)
the preventive measures taken or proposed by the beneficiary State to limit future damage and to avoid, to the extent possible, a recurrence of similar natural disasters or public health emergencies, including the use of European Structural and Investment Funds for this purpose;
(b)
the state of implementation of relevant Union legislation on disaster risk prevention and management;
(c)
the experience gained from the disaster or emergency and the measures taken or proposed to ensure environmental protection and resilience in relation to climate change, natural disasters and public health emergencies; and
(d)
any other relevant information on prevention and mitigation measures taken related to the nature of the natural disaster or public health emergency.
The implementation report shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards, establishing whether the statement justifying the expenditure gives a true and fair view and whether the financial contribution from the Fund is legal and regular, in line with Articles 59(5) and 60(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012.
At the end of the procedure referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission shall carry out a closure of the assistance from the Fund.’.
