The European Union Solidarity Fund (‘the Fund’) was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 (2). The Fund was created to provide financial assistance to Member States following major disasters as a concrete sign of European solidarity in situations of distress.
(2)
In the event of major public health emergencies, the Union should show its solidarity with Member States and the population concerned by providing financial assistance to help the population affected, to contribute to a rapid return to normal living conditions in the affected regions and to contain the spreading of infectious diseases.
(3)
The Union should also show solidarity in the event of major public health emergencies with the countries negotiating their accession to the Union.
(4)
A major crisis situation may result from public health emergencies, in particular an officially declared virus pandemic. The Fund enables the Union to help in mobilising emergency services to meet people’s immediate needs and to contribute to the short-term restoration of damaged key infrastructure so that economic activity can resume in the disaster-stricken regions. That Fund is currently limited, however, to natural disasters causing physical damage and does not include major disasters due to biological hazards. Provision should be made to allow the Union to intervene in the event of major public health emergencies.
