Article 7 and 7a are replaced by the following:
‘Article 7
1.   Without prejudice to Article 9(1a), Member States may maintain or introduce tolls and user charges on the trans-European road network or on certain sections of that network, and on any other additional sections of their network of motorways which are not part of the trans-European road network under the conditions laid down in paragraphs 4 to 14 of this Article and in Articles 7a to 7k.
2.   Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States, in compliance with the TFEU, to apply tolls and user charges on other roads, provided that the imposition of tolls and user charges on such other roads does not discriminate against international traffic and does not result in the distortion of competition between operators. Tolls and user charges applied on roads other than roads belonging to the trans-European road network and other than motorways, shall comply with the conditions laid down in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article, in Article 7a and in Article 7j(1), (2) and (4).
3.   Without prejudice to other provisions of this Directive, tolls and user charges for different categories of vehicles, such as heavy-duty vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, coaches and buses, light-duty vehicles, light commercial vehicles, minibuses and passenger cars, may be introduced or maintained independently from each other. However, where Member States charge passenger cars, they shall also charge light commercial vehicles.
4.   Member States shall not impose both tolls and user charges on any given category of vehicle for the use of a single road section. However, a Member State which imposes a user charge on its network may also impose tolls for the use of bridges, tunnels and mountain passes.
Member States may decide not to apply Article 7ca(3), Article 7ga(1) and Article 7gb(2) to such tolls for the use of bridges, tunnels and mountain passes where one or both of the following conditions is met:
(a)
application of Article 7ca(3), Article 7ga(1) Article 7gb(2) would not be technically practicable to introduce such differentiation in the tolling system concerned;
(b)
application of Article 7ca(3), Article 7ga(1) and Article 7gb(2) would lead to diversion of the most polluting vehicles, with negative impacts on road safety and public health.
A Member State that decides not to apply Article 7ca(3), Article 7ga(1) and Article 7gb(2) in accordance with the second subparagraph of this paragraph shall notify the Commission of its decision.
5.   Tolls and user charges shall not discriminate, directly or indirectly, on the grounds of:
(a)
the nationality of the road user;
(b)
the Member State or the third country of establishment of the transport operator;
(c)
the Member State or the third country of registration of the vehicle; or
(d)
the origin or destination of the transport operation.
6.   Member States may provide for reduced tolls or user charges on certain road sections, or completely exclude certain road sections from road charges, in particular where traffic intensity is low in sparsely populated areas.
7.   In the case of road infrastructures covered by concession contracts, where the contract was signed before 24 March 2022 or the tenders or responses to invitations to negotiate under the negotiated procedure were received pursuant to a public procurement process before 24 March 2022, Member States may choose not to apply Article 7ca(3), Article 7g(1) and (2), Article 7ga and Article 7gb to tolls and user charges on those infrastructures until the concession contract is renewed or the tolling or charging arrangement is substantially amended.
8.   Paragraph 7 applies also to long-term contracts, concluded between a public and non-public entity, signed before 24 March 2022 for the execution of works and/or the management of services other than the execution of works not including the transfer of the demand risk.
9.   Member States may provide for reduced tolls or user charges, or exemptions from the obligation to pay tolls or user charges for:
(a)
heavy-duty vehicles exempted from the requirement to install and use recording equipment under Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*);
(b)
heavy goods vehicles with a technically permissible maximum laden mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes and less than 7,5 tonnes used for carrying materials, equipment or machinery for the driver’s use in the course of the driver’s work, or for delivering goods which are produced on a craft basis, where the transport is not effected for hire or reward;
(c)
any vehicle covered by the conditions set out in Article 6(2), points (a) and (b), or any vehicle used or owned by persons with disabilities; and
(d)
zero-emission vehicles with a technically permissible maximum laden mass up to 4,25 tonnes.
10.   From 25 March 2030, Member States shall not apply user charges for heavy-duty vehicles on the core trans-European transport network.
11.   By way of derogation from paragraph 10, Member States may apply user charges for heavy-duty vehicles on sections of the core trans-European transport network but only in duly justified cases where applying a toll would:
(a)
involve disproportionate administrative, investment and operating costs compared to the expected revenue or benefits, which such a toll would generate, for example due to the limited length of the road sections concerned or the relatively low population density or the relatively low traffic; or
(b)
lead to the diversion of traffic with negative impacts on road safety or on public health.
Before applying those user charges, Member States shall notify the Commission of their intention to do so. That notification shall include the reasons justifying, in light of the first subparagraph, the application of the user charge based on objective criteria and clear information on the vehicles and road sections covered by the user charge.
Member States may submit one single notification for more road sections covered by the exemptions, provided that the justification is included for each section.
12.   Where Member States apply a common system for user charges in accordance with Article 8, those Member States shall adapt or discontinue the common system by 25 March 2032.
13.   Until 25 March 2027, as regards heavy goods vehicles, a Member State may choose to apply tolls or user charges only to heavy goods vehicles with a technically permissible maximum laden mass of not less than 12 tonnes where it considers that levying tolls or user charges to heavy goods vehicles of less than 12 tonnes would:
(a)
create significant adverse effects on the free flow of traffic, the environment, noise levels, congestion, health, or road safety, due to traffic diversion;
(b)
involve administrative costs of more than 15 % of the additional revenue resulting from that extension; or
(c)
concern a category of vehicles which does not cause more than 10 % of the chargeable infrastructure costs.
Member States choosing to apply tolls or user charges or both only to heavy goods vehicles with a technically permissible maximum laden mass of not less than 12 tonnes shall inform the Commission of their decision together with the reasons upon which it is based.
14.   Where tolls are applied to all heavy-duty vehicles, Member States may choose to recover a different percentage of costs from coaches and buses and motor caravans, on the one hand, and from heavy goods vehicles, on the other hand.
15.   By 25 March 2027, the Commission shall assess the implementation and effectiveness of this Directive with regard to the charging of light-duty vehicles.
That assessment shall take into account the evolution of charging systems applied to light-duty vehicles in terms of the type of charging applied to various vehicle categories, the extent of the network covered, the proportionality of pricing and other relevant elements.
Based on that assessment, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to amend the relevant provisions of this Directive.
Article 7a
1.   User charges shall be proportionate to the duration of the use made of the infrastructure.
2.   If user charges are applied in respect of heavy-duty vehicles, the use of the infrastructure shall be made available for at least the following periods: a day, a week, a month, and a year. The monthly rate shall not exceed 10 % of the annual rate, the weekly rate shall not exceed 5 % of the annual rate and the daily rate shall not exceed 2 % of the annual rate.
A Member State may decide that for vehicles registered in that Member State only annual rates shall apply.
Member States shall set user charges, including administrative costs, for all heavy-duty vehicles, at a level that does not exceed the maximum rates laid down in Annex II.
3.   If user charges are applied in respect of passenger cars, the use of the infrastructure shall be made available at least for the following periods: a day, a week or 10 days or both, a month or two months or both, and a year. The two-monthly rate shall not exceed 30 % of the annual rate, the monthly rate shall not exceed 19 % of the annual rate, the 10-day rate shall not exceed 12 % of the annual rate, the weekly rate shall not exceed 11 % of the annual rate and the daily rate shall not exceed 9 % of the annual rate.
Member States may limit the daily user charge for transit purposes only.
Member States may also make the use of the infrastructure available for other periods of time. In such cases, Member States shall apply rates in accordance with the principle of equal treatment between users, taking into account all relevant factors, in particular the annual rate and the rates applied for the other periods referred to in the first subparagraph, existing use patterns and administrative costs.
In respect of user charge schemes adopted before 24 March 2022, Member States may maintain rates above the limits set out in the first subparagraph, provided that they were in force before that date, and may maintain corresponding higher rates for other periods of use, in compliance with the principle of equal treatment. However, they shall comply with the limits set out in the first subparagraph as well as with the second subparagraph as soon as substantially amended charging arrangements enter into force and, at the latest, by 25 March 2030.
4.   For minibuses and light commercial vehicles, Member States shall comply with either paragraph 2 or 3. Where Member States set different user charges for light commercial vehicles than for passenger cars, they shall set higher user charge rates for light commercial vehicles than for passenger cars.
5.   By 25 March 2027, the Commission shall assess the technical and legal feasibility of differentiating the treatment of different light commercial vehicles based on whether or not the light commercial vehicle concerned is equipped with a tachograph. Based on that assessment, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to amend this Directive accordingly.

(*)  Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on tachographs in road transport, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (OJ L 60, 28.2.2014, p. 1.).’;"

1.   The infrastructure charge for heavy-duty vehicles shall be based on the principle of the recovery of infrastructure costs. The weighted average infrastructure charge for heavy-duty vehicles shall be related to the construction costs and the costs of operating, maintaining and developing the infrastructure network concerned. The weighted average infrastructure charge may also include a return on capital and/or a profit margin based on market conditions.
2.   The costs taken into account shall relate to the network or the part of the network on which infrastructure charges for heavy-duty vehicles are levied and to the vehicles that are subject to those charges. Member States may choose to recover only a percentage of those costs.
Article 7c
1.   Member States may maintain or introduce an external-cost charge, related to the cost of traffic-based air pollution, noise pollution, CO2 emissions or any combination thereof.
Where an external-cost charge is applied for heavy-duty vehicles, Member States shall vary it and set it in accordance with the minimum requirements and the methods referred to in Annex IIIa and shall respect the reference values set out in Annexes IIIb and IIIc. Member States may choose to recover only a percentage of those costs.
2.   The amount of the external-cost charge shall be set by the Member State concerned. If a Member State designates an authority for that purpose, that authority shall be legally and financially independent from the organisation in charge of managing or collecting part or all of the charge.
3.   Member States may apply exemptions which allow external-cost charges to be adjusted for vehicles of historical interest.’;
(6)
the following Articles are inserted:
‘Article 7ca
1.   When levying an external-cost charge for air or noise pollution, Member States shall take into account the costs relating to the network or the part of the network on which that charge is levied and the vehicles that are subject to that charge.
2.   The external-cost charge related to traffic-based air pollution shall not apply to heavy-duty vehicles which comply with the most stringent of Euro emission standards.
The first subparagraph shall cease to apply four years after the date when the rules which introduced those standards started to apply.
3.   From 25 March 2026, Member States shall apply an external-cost charge for traffic-based air pollution to heavy-duty vehicles on the tolled network referred to in Article 7(1).
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, Member States may decide not to apply an external-cost charge on those road sections where this would lead to the diversion of the most polluting vehicles, resulting in negative impacts on road safety and public health.
4.   Member States may assess the possibility of applying an external-cost charge for CO2 emissions and for air pollution or discounts, related to those emissions, where concession tolls are not varied in accordance with Articles 7g and 7ga for heavy-duty vehicles, and in accordance with Article 7gb for light-duty vehicles.
The result of that optional assessment, including a justification of the reason why the external-cost charge or discount is not applied, shall be notified to the Commission.
Article 7cb
1.   Member States may apply higher external-cost charges for CO2 emissions than the reference values set out in Annex IIIc, provided that this is done in a non-discriminatory manner, and limited to no more than twice the values set out in Annex IIIc. Where Member States apply this paragraph they shall justify their decision and notify it to the Commission, in accordance with Annex IIIa.
2.   For buses and coaches, Member States may choose to apply the same or lower values than those applied to heavy goods vehicles.
3.   An external-cost charge for CO2 emissions may be combined with an infrastructure charge that has been varied in accordance with Article 7ga.
4.   By 25 March 2027, the Commission shall assess the implementation and effectiveness of external-cost charging for CO2 emissions, as well as its coherence with Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (*) and Council Directive 2003/96/EC (**). Based on that assessment, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to amend this Article. In the event that this Article has not been amended accordingly by 1 January 2027 but Directive 2003/87/EC or Directive 2003/96/EC has been amended in a manner resulting in an effective internalisation of at least part of the external costs of CO2 emissions from road transport, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 9d of this Directive, amending Annex IIIc to this Directive to adjust the reference values of the external-cost charge for CO2 emissions, taking into account the effective carbon price applied to road transport fuels in the Union.

the following Article is inserted:
‘Article 7da
1.   Member States may, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex V, introduce a congestion charge on any section of their road network which is affected by congestion. The congestion charge may only be applied on those road sections which are regularly congested and only during the periods when they are typically congested.
2.   Member States shall specify the road sections and time periods referred to in paragraph 1 based on objective criteria related to the level to which the roads and their vicinities are affected by congestion, measured, inter alia, in terms of average delays or queue lengths.
3.   A congestion charge imposed on any section of the road network shall apply in a non-discriminatory manner to all vehicle categories, in accordance with the standard equivalence factors set out in Annex V. Member States may, however, exempt, partially or fully, minibuses, buses and coaches from congestion charge for the promotion of collective transport and socioeconomic development and territorial cohesion. Motor caravans, irrespective of their technically permissible maximum laden mass, shall not be treated as coaches and buses for the purpose of this paragraph.
4.   The congestion charge shall be set in accordance with the minimum requirements referred to in Annex V. It shall reflect the costs imposed by a vehicle on other road users, and indirectly on society, and shall respect the reference values set out in Annex VI for any given road type. Where a Member State intends to apply congestion charges higher than the reference values set out in Annex VI, it shall notify the Commission in accordance with the requirements referred to in Annex V.
Revenues generated from congestion charges, or the equivalent in financial value of those revenues, shall be used to address the problem of congestion, or to develop sustainable transport and mobility in general.
Where such revenues are allocated to the general budget, a Member State shall be deemed to have applied the second subparagraph, if it implements financial support policies to address the problem of congestion or to develop sustainable transport and mobility which have a value equivalent to the revenues generated from congestion charges.
5.   Member States shall put in place adequate mechanisms for monitoring the impact of congestion charges and for reviewing the level thereof. Each Member State shall review the level of charges regularly, at least every three years, to ensure that they do not exceed the costs of the congestion occurring in that Member State on the road sections subject to the congestion charge.’;
(9)
in Article 7e, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:
‘1.   Member States shall calculate the maximum level of infrastructure charge for heavy-duty vehicles using a methodology based on the core calculation principles set out in Article 7b and Annex III.
2.   For concession tolls, the maximum level of the infrastructure charge for heavy-duty vehicles shall be equivalent to, or less than, the level that would have resulted from the use of a methodology based on the core calculation principles set out in Article 7b and Annex III. The assessment of such equivalence shall be made on the basis of a reasonably long reference period appropriate to the nature of the concession contract.’;
(10)
Articles 7f and 7g are replaced by the following:
‘Article 7f
1.   After informing the Commission, a Member State may add a mark-up to the infrastructure charge levied on specific road sections which are regularly congested, or the use of which by vehicles causes significant environmental damage, where the following conditions are met:
(a)
the revenue generated from the mark-up is invested in financing the development of transport services, or in the construction or maintenance of transport infrastructure of the core trans-European transport network which contribute directly to the alleviation of the congestion or environmental damage and which are located in the same corridor as the road section on which the mark-up is applied;
(b)
the mark-up does not exceed 15 % of the weighted average infrastructure charge calculated in accordance with Article 7b(1) and Article 7e of this Directive, except where the revenue generated is invested in cross-border sections of a core network corridor identified in accordance with Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013, in which case the mark-up may not exceed 25 % of that weighted average infrastructure charge, or, where two or more Member States apply a mark-up in the same corridor, in which case, upon agreement of all Member States which are part of that corridor and which neighbour the Member States in the territory of which the section of the corridor to which a mark-up is to be applied falls, that mark-up may exceed 25 % but may not exceed 50 % of that weighted average infrastructure charge;
(c)
the application of the mark-up does not result in unfair treatment of commercial traffic compared to other road users;
(d)
a description of the exact location of the mark-up and proof of a decision to finance transport infrastructure or transport services referred to in point (a) are submitted to the Commission in advance of the application of the mark-up;
(e)
the period for which the mark-up is to apply is defined and limited in advance and is consistent, in terms of the expected revenue to be raised, with the financial plans and cost-benefit analysis for the projects co-financed with the revenue from the mark-up.
2.   In the case of a new cross-border project, a mark-up may only be added if all Member States involved in the project agree.
3.   A mark-up may be applied to an infrastructure charge which has been varied in accordance with Article 7g, 7ga or 7gb.
4.   After receiving the required information from a Member State intending to apply a mark-up, the Commission shall make that information available to the members of the Committee referred to in Article 9c. Where the Commission considers that the planned mark-up does not meet the conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, or where it considers that the planned mark-up will have significant adverse effects on the economic development of peripheral regions, it may adopt implementing acts, to reject or request amendment of the plans for charges submitted by the Member State concerned. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 9c(3).
5.   A mark-up may not be applied on road sections on which a congestion charge is levied.
Article 7g
1.   The infrastructure charge may be varied for the purpose of reducing congestion, minimising infrastructure damage and optimising the use of the infrastructure concerned or promoting road safety, where the following conditions are met:
(a)
the variation is transparent, made public and available to all users on equal terms;
(b)
the variation is applied according to the time of day, type of day or season;
(c)
no infrastructure charge is more than 175 % above the maximum level of the weighted average infrastructure charge as referred to in Article 7b;
(d)
the peak periods during which the higher infrastructure charges are levied for the purpose of reducing congestion do not exceed six hours per day;
(e)
the variation is devised and applied in a transparent and revenue-neutral way on a road section affected by congestion by offering reduced toll rates for road users who travel during off-peak periods and increased toll rates for road users who travel during peak hours on the same road section;
(f)
no congestion charge is levied on the road section concerned.
A Member State wishing to introduce such variation or changing an existing one shall inform the Commission thereof and provide it with the information necessary to assess whether the conditions are fulfilled.
2.   Until the variation of infrastructure charges and user charges referred to in Article 7ga is applied, in respect of heavy-duty vehicles, Member States shall vary the infrastructure charge according to the Euro emission class of the vehicle in such a way that no infrastructure charge is more than 100 % above the same charge for equivalent vehicles meeting the strictest Euro emission standards. Once infrastructure charges and user charges are varied pursuant to Article 7ga, Member States may discontinue the variation according to the Euro emission class.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, a Member State may decide not to apply the requirement of varying the infrastructure charge where any of the following applies:
(a)
it would seriously undermine the coherence of the tolling systems in its territory;
(b)
it would not be technically practicable to introduce such differentiation in the tolling system concerned;
(c)
it would lead to diversion of the most polluting vehicles with negative impacts on road safety and public health;
(d)
the toll includes an external-cost charge for air pollution.
Any such derogations or exemptions shall be notified to the Commission.
3.   The variations referred to in this Article shall not be designed to generate additional revenues.’;
(11)
the following Articles are inserted:
‘Article 7ga
1.   Member States shall vary infrastructure charges and user charges for heavy-duty vehicles in accordance with this Article.
Member States shall apply that variation to the sub-groups of heavy-duty vehicles covered by Article 2(1), points (a) to (d), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242, at the latest two years after the publication of the reference CO2 emissions for those vehicle sub-groups in the implementing acts adopted in accordance with Article 11(1) of that Regulation.
For CO2 emission classes 1, 4 and 5, referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, that variation shall apply to the groups of heavy-duty vehicles not covered by Article 2(1), points (a) to (d), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242, at the latest two years following the publication of the reference CO2 emissions in implementing acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article, for the relevant group. Where point 5.1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 is amended by a Union legislative act in such a way as to cover the reference CO2 emissions relevant for a group of heavy-duty vehicles, such reference CO2 emissions shall no longer be determined pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article but in accordance with point 5.1 of Annex I to that Regulation.
Where emission reduction trajectories for groups of heavy-duty vehicles not covered by Article 2(1), points (a) to (d), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242, are determined by a Union legislative act amending point 5.1 of Annex I to that Regulation, the variations for CO2 emission classes 2 and 3, as defined in paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply from the date of entry into force of the new emission reduction trajectories.
Without prejudice to the reduction of rates provided for in paragraph 3, Member States may provide for reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges, or exemptions to pay infrastructure or user charges for zero emission vehicles of any vehicle group from 24 March 2022 until 31 December 2025. From 1 January 2026, such reductions shall be limited to 75 % compared to the charge applicable to CO2 emission class 1, as defined in paragraph 2.
2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, Member States shall establish for each type of heavy-duty vehicle the following CO2 emission classes:
(a)
CO2 emission class 1 – vehicles that do not belong to any of the CO2 emission classes referred to under points (b) to (e);
(b)
CO2 emission class 2 – vehicles of the vehicle sub-group sg registered for the first time in the reporting period of the year Y with CO2 emissions more than 5 % below the emission reduction trajectory for the reporting period of the year Y and the vehicle sub-group sg but not belonging to any of the CO2 emission classes referred to under points (c), (d) and (e);
(c)
CO2 emission class 3 – vehicles of the vehicle sub-group sg registered for the first time in the reporting period of the year Y with CO2 emissions more than 8 % below the emission reduction trajectory for the reporting period of the year Y and the vehicle sub-group sg not belonging to any of the CO2 emission classes referred to under points (d) and (e);
(d)
CO2 emission class 4 – low-emission heavy-duty vehicles;
(e)
CO2 emission class 5 – zero-emission vehicles.
Member States shall ensure that the classification of a vehicle belonging to CO2 emission class 2 or 3 is reassessed every six years after the date of its first registration and that, where relevant, the vehicle is reclassified in the relevant emission class on the basis of the thresholds applicable at that time. Reclassification shall, with regard to a user charge, take effect at the latest on its first day of validity on or after the day of that reclassification.
3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, reduced charges shall apply to vehicles in CO2 emission classes 2, 3, and 4 and 5, as follows:
(a)
CO2 emission class 2 – 5 % to 15 % reduction compared to the charge applicable for CO2 emission class 1;
(b)
CO2 emission class 3 – 15 % to 30 % reduction compared to the charge applicable for CO2 emission class 1;
(c)
CO2 emission class 4 – 30 % to 50 % reduction compared to the charge applicable for CO2 emission class 1;
(d)
CO2 emission class 5 – 50 % to 75 % reduction compared to the charge applicable for CO2 emission class 1.
Where the infrastructure charge or the user charge is also varied according to the Euro emission class, the reductions referred to in the first subparagraph shall apply as compared to the charge applied to the strictest Euro emission standards.
4.   The variations referred to in this Article shall not be designed to generate additional revenues.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a Member State may decide not to apply the requirement of varying the infrastructure charge in accordance with paragraph 2 where an external-cost charge for CO2 emissions is levied and varied according to the reference values of the external-cost charge for CO2 emissions in Annex IIIc.
6.   On road sections where a vehicle is operated without CO2 emissions in a verifiable manner, Member States may apply to that vehicle reduced charges in accordance with CO2 emission class 5. Member States that make use of that option shall apply the charges applicable to CO2 emission class 1 to that vehicle on other road sections.
7.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to specify the reference CO2 emissions for the vehicle groups not covered by Article 2(1), points (a) to (d), of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242.
Those implementing acts shall reproduce the data relevant for each vehicle groups published in the report referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/956. The Commission shall adopt those implementing acts at the latest six months after the publication of the relevant report referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/956.
8.   By 25 March 2027, the Commission shall assess the implementation and effectiveness of the variation of charges based on CO2 emissions referred to in this Article, as well as whether it is still necessary and its coherence with Directives 2003/87/EC and 2003/96/EC. Based on that assessment, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to amend the relevant provisions of this Directive on the variation of charges on the basis of CO2 emissions.
9.   The Commission shall, every five years, after 24 March 2022, review the maximum rates for the user charges in Annex II and the reduction levels referred to in paragraph 3 and, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal, based on the results of that review process, to amend those provisions.
10.   Every 30 months after 24 March 2022, the Commission shall draw up a report assessing the appropriateness of the thresholds for CO2 emission classes 2 and 3 referred to in Article 7ga(2), points (b) and (c), of this Directive in relation to the reference emissions published in accordance with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 or to the CO2 emissions reported in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/956, and where appropriate submit a legislative proposal to amend those thresholds based on the results of that assessment.
11.   The application of the variation of charges based on CO2 emissions referred to in this Article shall not be mandatory where another Union road transport fuel carbon-pricing measure applies.
Article 7gb
1.   Member States may differentiate tolls and user charges for light-duty vehicles according to the environmental performance of the vehicle determined by the specific CO2 emissions combined, or weighted combined, recorded in entry 49 of the certificate of conformity of the vehicle, and by the Euro emission performance.
Without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article, lower rates of tolls and user charges shall apply for passenger cars, minibuses and light commercial vehicles that meet both of the following conditions:
(a)
their specific CO2 emissions, determined in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1151 (*), shall be zero or shall be below the following levels:
(i)
for the period 2021 to 2024, the EU fleet-wide targets2021 determined in accordance with Part A, point 6, and Part B, point 6, of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council (**);

(iii)
for the period 2030 onwards, the EU fleet-wide targets determined in accordance with Part A, point 6.1.2, and Part B, point 6.1.2, of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2019/631;
(b)
their pollutant emissions, determined in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1151, shall be as specified in the Table of Annex VII to this Directive. Member States may apply the reduction for zero-emission vehicles referred to in Annex VII to this Directive without applying reductions for the other emissions performance categories referred to in that Annex.
2.   From 1 January 2026, where technically practicable, Member States shall vary the tolls and the annual rate of the user charges for vans and minibuses according to the environmental performance of the vehicle, in accordance with the rules set out in Annex VII. For that purpose, the provisions of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be indicative.
Where Member States choose to apply different emission performance criteria or levels of reduction to those set out in paragraph 1, or choose to include different or additional criteria, they shall notify the Commission of their choices and justify them, at least six months before the introduction of any variation.
However, Member States may choose to apply reductions to zero-emission vehicles only, without applying any variation to other vehicles and without notifying the Commission.
3.   Subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States may take into account an improvement in the environmental performance of the vehicle which is linked to that vehicle’s conversion to alternative fuels.
4.   Member States may adopt exceptional measures for the purpose of charging vehicles of historical interest.
5.   The variations referred to in this Article shall not be designed to generate additional revenues.
