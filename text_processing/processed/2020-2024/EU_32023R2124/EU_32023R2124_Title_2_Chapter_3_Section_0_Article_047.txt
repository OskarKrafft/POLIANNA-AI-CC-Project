Article 47
Fleet management measures
1.   Vessels or fishers shall be authorised to harvest red coral in the Mediterranean Sea only if they hold a valid fishing authorisation issued respectively by the flag Member State authority or by the authorities of the coastal Member State where the fishing activities take place. Such authorisations shall specify the technical conditions under which the fishery may be carried out.
2.   In the absence of an authorisation as referred to in paragraph 1, it shall be prohibited to harvest, retain on board, tranship, land, transfer, store, sell or display or offer for sale red coral.
3.   A fishing authorisation may only be granted to a fisher (diver) who complies with standards for professional diving in accordance with national legislation.
4.   Member States shall maintain an updated register of fishing authorisations referred to in paragraph 1 and shall send to the Commission, by 15 June of each year, the list of fishers and/or vessels for which the authorisations referred to in paragraph 1 were issued. The Commission shall communicate that list to the GFCM Secretariat not later than 30 June of each year. That list shall include, for each vessel, at least the information referred to in Annex VIII.
5.   Member States shall not increase the number of fishing authorisations referred to in paragraph 1 until scientific advice validated by the SAC indicates that red coral populations have rebuilt to sustainable levels allowing them to sustain increased exploitation.
