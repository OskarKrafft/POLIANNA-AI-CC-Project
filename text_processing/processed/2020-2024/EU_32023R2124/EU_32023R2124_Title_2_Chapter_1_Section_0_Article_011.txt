Article 11
Designated landing points
1.   Landing of European eel shall only be authorised in landing points designated by each Member State for this purpose.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may put in place measures alternative to designated landing points, provided that those measures effectively contribute to the fight against illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing.
