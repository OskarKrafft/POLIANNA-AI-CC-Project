Article 88
FAD composition, location, maintenance and replacement
1.   In cases where the surface structure of the FAD is covered with material, Member States shall ensure that the material concerned is removed or that the structure is covered only with material that involve minimal risk of entangling non-target species, especially vulnerable species, or affecting other vessels.
2.   FAD subsurface components shall be exclusively composed of materials that do not entangle non-target species.
3.   When designing FADs, biodegradable materials shall be prioritised.
4.   FADs shall be reliably located at their place of deployment. The design of FADs shall include an appropriate number of counterweights along the rope to ensure that the rope sinks to the sea bottom in the event that the raft section is detached and drifts away.
5.   Fishers or masters of fishing vessels exploiting common dolphinfish shall ensure that FADs are regularly maintained, replaced as necessary and removed when not in use. The replacement FADs shall be of the same type, design, construction, materials and identification as the FAD being replaced. Replacement anchored FADs shall be in the same position as the FAD being replaced.
6.   In the event of loss or impossibility to haul in a FAD, fishers or masters of fishing vessels shall record the last known position and its date. Fishing vessels exploiting common dolphinfish shall collect and report the last registered position of the lost FAD as well as the date of its last registered position, its identification number and any information allowing the identification of the FAD owner.
7.   Member States shall adopt all necessary measures to ensure that obsolete and unused FADs are retrieved.
8.   It shall be prohibited for a vessel flying the flag of a Member State to catch fish attracted by a FAD that has not been set by that vessel.
