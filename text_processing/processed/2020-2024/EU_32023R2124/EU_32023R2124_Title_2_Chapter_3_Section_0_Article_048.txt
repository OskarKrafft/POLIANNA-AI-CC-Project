ArticleÂ 48
Designated landing points
Authorised fishers or vessels shall only land and tranship red coral catches in designated landing points. To this end, each Member State shall designate landing points in which landing and transhipment of red coral is authorised and communicate a list of those designated landing points to the Commission by 15 June of each year. The Commission shall transmit that list to the GFCM Secretariat by 30 June of each year, unless there is no change of designated landing points already communicated. Member States shall immediately communicate any update of that list to the Commission. The Commission shall transmit those updates to the GFCM Secretariat without delay.
