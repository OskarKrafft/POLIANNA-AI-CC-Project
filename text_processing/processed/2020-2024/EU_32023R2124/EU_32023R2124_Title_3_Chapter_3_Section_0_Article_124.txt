Article 124
Prior notice
By way of derogation from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the period for prior notification shall be at least 72 hours before the estimated time of arrival at the port. However, a Member State may set a different notification period taking into account, inter alia, the distance between the fishing grounds and its ports. In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission and the GFCM Secretariat, which will integrate that information in the register of ports.
