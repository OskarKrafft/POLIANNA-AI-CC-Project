Article 103
Incidental catches of sea turtles in fishing gear
1.   To the extent possible, sea turtles incidentally caught in fishing gear shall be safely handled and released unharmed and alive.
2.   Masters of fishing vessels shall not bring ashore sea turtles unless as part of a specific rescue or national conservation programme or unless this is otherwise required in order to rescue, and secure assistance for the recovery of, harmed and comatose individual sea turtles and provided that the competent national authorities concerned have been duly and officially informed prior to the fishing vessel concerned returning to port.
3.   As far as practicable, fishing vessels using purse seines for small pelagic species or surrounding nets without purse line for pelagic species shall avoid encircling sea turtles.
4.   Fishing vessels using long-lines and bottom-set gillnets shall carry on board safe-handling, disentanglement and release equipment designed to ensure that sea turtles are handled and released in a manner that maximises the probability of their survival.
