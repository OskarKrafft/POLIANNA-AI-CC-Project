Article 105
Incidental catches of cetaceans
1.   Fishing vessels shall promptly return to the sea unharmed and alive, as far as practicable, cetaceans incidentally caught in fishing gear and brought alongside the fishing vessel.
2.   Member States shall set up adequate monitoring systems in order to collect reliable information on the impact on cetacean populations in the Black Sea of fishing vessels targeting piked dogfish with bottom-set gillnets, and shall submit that information to the Commission. The Commission shall transmit this information to the GFCM Secretariat without delay.
