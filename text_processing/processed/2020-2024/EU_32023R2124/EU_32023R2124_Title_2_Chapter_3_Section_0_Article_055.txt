Article 55
Traceability of red coral products
1.   For a transitional period of three years (2020–2022), Member States may participate in the pilot phase of the Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS), for the purpose of identifying where the origin of red coral is harvested in the GFCM area of application, and implement the following traceability measures:
(a)
a validated CDS certificate as referred to in Annex X and issued by the competent authorities of the flag State shall accompany all landings, imports, export and re-exports of red coral harvested;
(b)
each certificate shall have a unique document identification number. Such number shall be specific to the flag State and be assigned to each fisher or authorised vessel. Such certificates shall not be transferable to another fisher or authorised vessel;
(c)
Member States shall validate the CDS harvest certificates for red coral only when all the information contained in the CDS has been established to be accurate as a result of the verification of the supporting documents and corresponding consignment.
2.   Member States participating in the pilot phase shall report to the Commission, and the Commission shall report to the GFCM Secretariat accordingly, on the implementation of the pilot phase in the context of a permanent CDS for red coral.
