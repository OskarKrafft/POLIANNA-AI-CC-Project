Article 10
WTO domestic support
Member States shall design the interventions on the basis of the types of intervention which are listed in Annex II to this Regulation, including the definitions and conditions set out in Article 4, in such a way that they qualify under the criteria of Annex 2 to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.
In particular, the basic income support for sustainability, the complementary redistributive income support for sustainability, the complementary income support for young farmers and the schemes for the climate, the environment and animal welfare shall qualify under the criteria of the paragraphs of Annex 2 to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture indicated in Annex II to this Regulation for those interventions. For other interventions, the paragraphs of Annex 2 to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture indicated in Annex II to this Regulation are indicative and those interventions may instead comply with a different paragraph of Annex 2 to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture if that is specified and explained in the CAP Strategic Plan.
