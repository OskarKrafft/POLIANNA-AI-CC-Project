Article 143
General provisions
1.   Member States shall provide the Commission with the available information necessary to enable it to perform the monitoring and evaluation of the CAP referred to in Article 141.
2.   Data needed for the context and impact indicators shall primarily come from established data sources, such as the Farm Accountancy Data Network and Eurostat. Where data for those indicators are not available or not complete, the gaps shall be addressed in the context of the European Statistical Programme established under Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (51), the Farm Accountancy Data Network established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 (52), or through formal agreements with other data providers such as the Joint Research Centre and the European Environment Agency.
3.   Data from administrative registers, such as the integrated system referred to in Article 65(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2116, the identification system for agricultural parcels referred to in Article 68 of that Regulation, and animal and vineyard registers, shall also be used for statistical purposes, in cooperation with statistical authorities in Member States and with Eurostat.
4.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down rules on the information to be sent by Member States, taking into account the need to avoid any undue administrative burden, as well as the data needs and synergies between potential data sources. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 153(2).
