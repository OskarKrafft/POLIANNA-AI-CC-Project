Article 22
Amount of support per hectare
1.   Unless Member States decide to grant the basic income support on the basis of payment entitlements as referred to in Article 23, the support shall be paid as a uniform amount per hectare.
2.   Member States may decide to differentiate the amount of the basic income support per hectare amongst different groups of territories faced with similar socio-economic or agronomic conditions, including traditional forms of agriculture as determined by Member States, such as traditional extensive alpine pasture. In accordance with Article 109(2), point (d), the amount of basic income support per hectare may be reduced, taking into account support under other interventions in the CAP Strategic Plan concerned.
