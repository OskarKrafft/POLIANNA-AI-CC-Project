Article 13
Obligations of Member States relating to good agricultural and environmental condition
1.   Member States shall ensure that all agricultural areas, including land which is no longer used for production purposes, are maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition. Member States shall set, at national or regional level, minimum standards for farmers and other beneficiaries for each GAEC standard listed in Annex III in line with the main objective of those standards as referred to in that Annex.

Member States shall not set minimum standards for main objectives other than the main objectives laid down in Annex III.
3.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 152 supplementing this Regulation with rules to ensure a level playing field as regards the ratio for GAEC standard 1.
