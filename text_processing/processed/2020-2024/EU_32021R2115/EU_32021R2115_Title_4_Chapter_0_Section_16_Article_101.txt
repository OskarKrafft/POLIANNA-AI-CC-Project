2.   By derogation to paragraph 1, for the types of intervention in the sectors referred to in Article 42, points (a), (d), (e) and (f), Member States shall set out, in their CAP Strategic Plans, an indicative financial allocation for each sector and for each year, representing the expected level of payments for the interventions in that sector per financial year, excluding expected payments on the basis of national financial assistance referred to in Article 53.
3.   The indicative financial allocations set out by Member States in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not prevent those Member States from using funds from those indicative financial allocations as funds for other interventions, without amending their CAP Strategic Plans in accordance with Article 119, subject to compliance with this Regulation, and in particular with Articles 87, 88, 89, 90, 92 to 98 and 102 thereof, and with Regulation (EU) 2021/2116, and in particular with Article 32(6), point (b), thereof, as well as with the following conditions:
(a)
financial allocations for interventions in the form of direct payments are used for other interventions in the form of direct payments;
(b)
financial allocations for rural development interventions are used for other interventions for rural development;
(c)
financial allocations for interventions in the apiculture sector and in the wine sector are only used for other interventions in the same sector;
(d)
financial allocations for interventions in other sectors referred to in Article 42, point (f), are used for interventions in other sectors referred to in that point laid down in the CAP Strategic Plan and such use does not affect approved operational programmes.
For the purpose of the first subparagraph, point (a), Member States which have decided to grant the basic income support on the basis of payment entitlements in accordance with Article 23 may linearly increase or decrease the amounts to be paid on the basis of the value of the entitlements activated in the calendar year, within the limits of the minimum and maximum planned unit amounts set out for interventions under the basic income support in accordance with Article 102(2).
