Article 109
Intervention strategy
1.   The intervention strategy referred to in Article 107(1), point (b), shall set out, for each specific objective set out in Article 6(1) and (2) and addressed in the CAP Strategic Plan:
(a)
targets and related milestones for the relevant result indicators used by the Member State on the basis of its assessment of needs referred to in Article 108. The value of those targets shall be justified on the basis of that assessment of needs. As regards the specific objectives set out in Article 6(1), points (d), (e), and (f), targets shall be derived from the elements of explanation given in paragraph 2, point (a), of this Article;
(b)
interventions, based on the types of intervention set out in Title III, which shall be designed to address the specific situation in the area concerned, following a sound intervention logic, supported by the ex-ante evaluation referred to in Article 139, the SWOT analysis referred to in Article 115(2) and the assessment of needs referred to in Article 108;
(c)
elements showing how the interventions allow reaching the targets and how they are mutually coherent and compatible;
(d)
elements demonstrating that the allocation of financial resources to the interventions of the CAP Strategic Plan is justified and adequate to achieve the targets set, and is consistent with the financial plan referred to in Article 112.
2.   The intervention strategy shall demonstrate the consistency of the strategy and the complementarity of interventions across the specific objectives set out in Article 6(1) and (2) by providing:
(a)
an overview of the environmental and climate architecture of the CAP Strategic Plan which describes the following:
(i)
for each GAEC standard listed in Annex III, the way in which the Union standard is implemented, including the following elements: summary of the on-farm practice, territorial scope, types of farmers and other beneficiaries subject to the standard, and where necessary a description of how the practice contributes to achieving that GAEC standard’s main objective;
(ii)
the overall contribution of conditionality to achieving the specific objectives set out in Article 6(1), points (d), (e) and (f);
(iii)
the complementarity between the relevant baseline conditions, as referred to in Article 31(5) and Article 70(3), conditionality and the different interventions, including support for organic farming, addressing the specific objectives set out in Article 6(1), points (d), (e), and (f);
(iv)
the way to achieve the greater overall contribution set out in Article 105;
(v)
how the environmental and climate architecture of the CAP Strategic Plan is meant to contribute to the achievement of, and be consistent with, the long-term national targets set out in or deriving from the legislative acts listed in Annex XIII;
(b)
in relation to the specific objective set out in Article 6(1), point (g), an overview of the relevant interventions and specific conditions for young farmers set out in the CAP Strategic Plan such as those specified in Article 26(4), point (a), Articles 30, 73 and 75 and Article 77(6). Member States shall in particular refer to Article 95 when presenting the financial plan in relation to the types of intervention referred to in Articles 30, 73 and 75. The overview shall also explain in general terms the interplay with national instruments with a view of improving the consistency between Union and national actions in this area;
(c)
an explanation how the interventions under coupled income support as referred to in Title III, Chapter II, Section 3, Subsection 1, are consistent with Directive 2000/60/EC;
(d)
in relation to the specific objective set out in Article 6(1), point (a), an overview of how the aim of fairer distribution and more effective and efficient targeting of income support to be granted to farmers under the CAP Strategic Plan is addressed including, where applicable, information justifying the use of the derogation provided for in Article 29(1), second subparagraph. That overview shall, where relevant, also address the consistency and complementarity of the territorialisation of the basic income support referred to in Article 22(2) with support under other interventions, in particular the payments for natural or other area-specific constraints referred to in Article 71;
(e)
an overview of the sector-related interventions, including the coupled income support referred to in Title III, Chapter II, Section 3, Subsection 1, and the interventions in certain sectors referred to in Title III, Chapter III, providing a justification for targeting the sectors concerned, the list of interventions per sector, and their complementarity;
(f)
where relevant, an explanation as to which interventions are intended to contribute to ensuring a coherent and integrated approach to risk management;
(g)
where relevant, a description of the interplay between national and regional interventions, including the distribution of financial allocations per intervention and per fund;
(h)
an overview of how the CAP Strategic Plan contributes to achieving the specific objective of improving animal welfare and combatting antimicrobial resistance set out in Article 6(1), point (i), including the baseline conditions and the complementarity between conditionality and the different interventions;
(i)
an explanation of how the interventions and elements common to several interventions contribute to simplification for final beneficiaries and reducing the administrative burden.
3.   Where elements of the CAP Strategic Plan are established at regional level, the intervention strategy shall ensure the coherence and the consistency of those elements with the elements of the CAP Strategic Plan established at national level.
