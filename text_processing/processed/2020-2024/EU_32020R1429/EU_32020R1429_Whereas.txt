Whereas:
(1)
The COVID-19 outbreak has brought about a sharp drop in demand for rail transport services. This has had a serious impact on railway undertakings. The impact started to manifest itself as early as 1 March 2020 and is likely to last until at least 31 December 2020. The circumstances linked to the COVID-19 outbreak are beyond the control of railway undertakings which are facing considerable liquidity problems and major losses, and in some cases the risk of insolvency.
(2)
In order to counteract the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, railway undertakings might need financial support. It might not be possible for railway undertakings to pay charges for accessing rail infrastructure due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and, for that reason, infrastructure managers should be authorised to reduce, waive or defer such charges. This possibility should be granted for a period during which the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the rail market have already manifested itself and are expected to do so, i.e. from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020 (the ‘reference period’).
