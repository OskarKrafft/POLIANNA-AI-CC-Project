Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide for the continued application of the rules of the current CAP framework and for uninterrupted payments to farmers and other beneficiaries, and thus provide predictability and stability during the transitional period, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
