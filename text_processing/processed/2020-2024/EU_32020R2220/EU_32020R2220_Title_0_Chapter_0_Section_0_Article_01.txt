Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 allows Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development as regards calendar years 2014 to 2020. In order to ensure that Member States may follow their own strategy, the flexibility between pillars should be made available also for calendar year 2021 (financial year 2022) and calendar year 2022 (financial year 2023).
