Article 36
Commission monitoring, review and reports
1.   The Commission shall monitor and review the application of this Regulation and submit, by 1 January 2028 and every 5 years thereafter, a report to the European Parliament and to the Council.
2.   The first report referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular review the following:
(a)
the effectiveness and efficiency of this Regulation in establishing transparent and accurate measurement, reporting and verification rules and in reducing methane emissions associated with the production of crude oil, natural gas and coal placed on the Union market;
(b)
if feasible, the achieved level of reduction of methane emissions associated with the production of crude oil, natural gas and coal placed on the Union market as a result of this Regulation;
(c)
whether additional or alternative measures are necessary to foster and accelerate the reduction of methane emissions in the value chain of crude oil, natural gas and coal placed on the Union market to support the Union’s target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and its commitments under the Paris Agreement.
That review shall take into account the relevant Union legislation in related fields. The Commission, where appropriate, shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal together with its report, taking into account the relevant Union legislation in related fields.
