Article 26
Mitigation measures
1.   On the basis of the inventory referred to in Article 25, Member States shall develop and implement a mitigation plan to address methane emissions from closed underground coal mines and abandoned underground coal mines where operations ceased after 3 August 1954.
That mitigation plan shall be submitted to the competent authorities by 5 February 2027. It shall include key milestones for its implementation and at least the elements set out in Part 3 of Annex VIII.
2.   Venting and flaring from equipment referred to in Article 25(2) shall be prohibited from 1 January 2030, unless utilisation of methane or reduction of methane emissions is not technically feasible or risks endangering environmental safety, human safety, including that of the personnel, or health. In such a situation, as part of the reporting obligations set out in Article 25, mine operators or Member States shall demonstrate the necessity of venting or flaring instead of utilisation of methane or reduction of methane emissions.
3.   Alternative use of abandoned underground coal mines shall be allowed following a permitting procedure adapted to the specific type of alternative use of the abandoned underground coal mine. The applicant shall provide to the competent authorities a detailed plan of measures to avoid methane emissions. The permit holder shall comply with the monitoring, reporting and mitigation obligations under Article 25 and this Article.
4.   Without prejudice to the applicable sector-specific Union law, for closed underground coal mines, existing best mitigation practices to reduce methane emissions shall be allowed.
