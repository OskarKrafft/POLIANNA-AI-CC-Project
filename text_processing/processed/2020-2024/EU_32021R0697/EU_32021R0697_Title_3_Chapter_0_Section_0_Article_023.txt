Article 23
Ownership of results of development actions
1.   The Union shall neither own the defence products or technologies resulting from development actions supported by the Fund, nor have any IPRs claim pertaining to those actions.
2.   The results of development actions supported by the Fund shall not be subject to any control or restriction by non-associated third countries or by non-associated third-country entities, directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediate legal entities, including in terms of technology transfer.
3.   This Regulation shall not affect the Member States’ discretion as regards their policy on the export of defence-related products.
4.   With regard to results generated by recipients through development actions supported by the Fund, and without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, the Commission shall be notified prior to any transfer of ownership to a non-associated third country or to a non-associated third-country entity. Where such a transfer of ownership contravenes the security and defence interests of the Union and its Member States or the objectives set out in Article 3, the support provided from the Fund shall be reimbursed.
5.   Where Union support is provided in the form of the public procurement of a study, all Member States or associated countries shall have the right, free of charge, to a non-exclusive licence for the use of the study upon written request.
