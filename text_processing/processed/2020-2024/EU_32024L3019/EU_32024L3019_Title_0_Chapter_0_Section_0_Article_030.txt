Article 30
Evaluation
1.   By 31 December 2033 and by 31 December 2040, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this Directive based in particular on the following elements:
(a)
the experience gained through the implementation of this Directive;
(b)
the data sets referred to in Article 22(1);
(c)
relevant scientific, analytical and epidemiological data, including results from research projects funded by the Union;
(d)
WHO recommendations, where available.
That evaluation shall, as a minimum, contain an analysis of:
(a)
the appropriateness of the public health parameters referred to Article 17(1) to be monitored by Member States;
(b)
the added value of mandatory monitoring of specific public health parameters;
(c)
the possible need to adapt the list of products to be covered by extended producer responsibility to the evolution of the range of products placed on the market, improved knowledge on the presence of micropollutants in urban wastewater, their impacts on the environment and public health, data resulting from the new monitoring obligations on micropollutants in the inlets and outlets of the urban wastewater treatment plants and an analysis of the need to revise the condition for exemption from extended producer responsibility referred to in Article 9(2), point (a);
(d)
the added value and the appropriateness of requiring mandatory national water reuse plans, including national targets and measures, taking into account the evolution of Union policies and law related to water management;
(e)
the objective of energy neutrality in order to analyse the technical and economic feasibility and environmental and climate benefits of achieving a higher level of energy autonomy for the sector;
(f)
the possibilities for measuring direct and indirect GHG emissions emitted by the urban wastewater sector, including emissions of GHGs other than those referred to in Article 21(1), point (d), and for setting requirements for actual measurements in connection with the monitoring, taking into account the most recent methodologies for the measurement of GHG emissions of the urban wastewater sector set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;
(g)
the possible impacts on the functioning of the internal market of the potentially different contribution rates for producers set by Member States and that are referred to in Article 9(1);
(h)
the feasibility and appropriateness of the development of an extended producer responsibility system for products generating PFAS and microplastics in urban wastewater based in particular on the monitoring data provided for in Article 21 on PFAS and microplastics in the inlets and outlets of the urban wastewater treatment plants;
(i)
the possibility of the urban wastewater treatment sector reaching climate neutrality, and the time required to do so;
(j)
the feasibility and appropriateness of setting Union minimum reuse and recycling rates for nitrogen from sludge or from urban wastewater, or both.
The Commission shall present a report on the main findings of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions accompanied, where the Commission finds it appropriate, by relevant legislative proposals.
2.   Member States shall provide the Commission with the information necessary for the preparation of the report referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph.
