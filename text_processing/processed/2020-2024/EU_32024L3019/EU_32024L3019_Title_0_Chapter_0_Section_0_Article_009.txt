(b)
those producers are required to contribute financially to the producer responsibility organisations in order to cover the costs arising from their extended producer responsibility;
(c)
each producer’s contribution, as referred to in point (b), is determined on the basis of the quantities and hazardousness in the urban wastewater of the substances contained in the products that are placed on the market;

Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 28(2) no later than 31 December 2027.
