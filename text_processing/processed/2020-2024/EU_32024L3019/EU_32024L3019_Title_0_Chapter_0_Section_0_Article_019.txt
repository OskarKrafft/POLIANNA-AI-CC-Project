Article 19
Access to sanitation
Without prejudice to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and taking into account local and regional perspectives and circumstances for sanitation, Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure access to sanitation for all, in particular for vulnerable and marginalised groups.
For that purpose, Member States shall by 12 January 2029:
(a)
identify people without access, or with limited access, to sanitation facilities, paying special attention to vulnerable and marginalised groups, and provide reasons for such lack of access;
(b)
assess the options for improving access to sanitation facilities for such people;
(c)
for all agglomerations of 10 000 p.e. and above, encourage the establishment of a sufficient number of sanitation facilities in public spaces which are freely and, in particular for women, safely accessible and ensure the provision of appropriate information about those facilities to the public;
(d)
for all agglomerations of 5 000 p.e. and above, encourage competent authorities to make available a sufficient number of free sanitation facilities in public buildings, in particular in administrative buildings;
(e)
encourage the making available of sanitation facilities for all, for free or for a low service fee, in restaurants, shops and similar private spaces accessible to the public.
