Article 12
Transboundary cooperation
1.   Without prejudice to relevant existing international agreements or arrangements on environmental water issues, where waters within the area of jurisdiction of a Member State are adversely affected by discharges of urban wastewater from another Member State or third-country, the Member State whose waters are affected shall notify the other Member State or the third country and the Commission of the relevant facts.
That notification shall be immediate in the case of pollution that could significantly affect downstream water bodies. In the event of any discharge affecting health or the environment in another Member State, the Member State in whose territory the discharge has occurred shall ensure that the competent authority of the other Member State and the Commission are immediately informed.
2.   Member States shall respond to each other in a timely manner, according to the type, importance and possible consequences of the incident, after the notification by another Member State in accordance with paragraph 1.
The Member States concerned shall cooperate in order to identify the discharges in question and the measures to be taken at source to protect the waters that are affected in order to ensure conformity with this Directive.
3.   The Member States concerned shall inform the Commission of any cooperation referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission shall participate in such cooperation at the request of the Member States concerned.
