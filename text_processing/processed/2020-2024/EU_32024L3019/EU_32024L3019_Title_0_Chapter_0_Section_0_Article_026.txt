Article 26
Compensation
1.   Member States shall ensure that, where damage to human health has occurred as a result of a violation of national measures that were adopted pursuant to this Directive, the individuals affected have the right to claim and obtain compensation for that damage from the relevant natural or legal persons, in accordance with national rules.
2.   Member States shall ensure that, as part of the public concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting the protection of the environment or human health and meeting any requirements under national law are allowed to represent the individuals affected. Member States shall ensure that a claim for a violation leading to damage cannot be pursued twice by the individuals affected and by the non-governmental organisations referred to in this paragraph.
3.   Member States shall ensure that national rules and procedures relating to claims for compensation are designed and applied in such a way that they do not render impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of the right to compensation for damage caused by a violation pursuant to paragraph 1.
4.   Member States may establish the limitation periods for bringing actions for compensation referred to in paragraph 1. Such periods shall not begin to run before the violation has ceased and the person claiming the compensation knows or can reasonably be expected to know that he or she suffered damage from a violation pursuant to paragraph 1.
5.   Member States shall ensure that information is made available to the public on their right to claim compensation for damage.
