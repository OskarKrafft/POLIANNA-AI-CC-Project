Article 20
Sludge and resource recovery
1.   Member States shall encourage the recovery of valuable resources and take the measures necessary to ensure that sludge management conforms to the waste hierarchy provided for in Article 4 of Directive 2008/98/EC. Such sludge management shall:
(a)
maximise prevention;
(b)
prepare for reuse, recycling and other recovery of resources, in particular phosphorus and nitrogen, taking into account national or local valorisation options; and
(c)
minimise the adverse effects on the environment and human health.
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 27 to supplement this Directive by specifying a combined minimum reuse and recycling rate for phosphorus from sludge and from urban wastewater not reused under the derogation of Article 15(1), taking into account available technologies, resources and the economic viability of phosphorus recovery as well as the phosphorus content of the sludge and the level of saturation of the national market with organic phosphorus from other sources while ensuring that there is safe sludge management and no adverse impact on the environment or human health. The Commission shall adopt those delegated acts by 2 January 2028.
