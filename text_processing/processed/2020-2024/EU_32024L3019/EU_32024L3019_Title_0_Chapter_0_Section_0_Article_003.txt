Article 3
Collecting systems and calculation of the load of an agglomeration
1.   Member States shall ensure that all agglomerations of 2 000 p.e. and above comply with the following requirements:
(a)
they are provided with collecting systems;
(b)
all their sources of domestic wastewater are connected to the collecting system.
2.   Member States shall ensure that agglomerations of 1 000 p.e. and above but below 2 000 p.e. comply with the requirements of paragraph 1 by 31 December 2035.
Member States may derogate from the deadline referred to in the first subparagraph for a maximum period of:
(a)
8 years where on 1 January 2025:
(i)
less than 50 % of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph are provided with collecting systems; or
(ii)
less than 50 % of the urban wastewater load of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph is collected in collecting systems;
(b)
10 years where on 1 January 2025:
(i)
less than 25 % of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph are provided with collecting systems; or
(ii)
less than 25 % of the urban wastewater load of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph is collected in collecting systems.
Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania may derogate from the deadline referred to in the first subparagraph for a maximum period of:
(a)
12 years where on 1 January 2025:
(i)
less than 50 % of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph are provided with collecting systems; or
(ii)
less than 50 % of the urban wastewater load of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph is collected in collecting systems;
(b)
14 years where on 1 January 2025:
(i)
less than 25 % of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph are provided with collecting systems; or
(ii)
less than 25 % of the urban wastewater load of the agglomerations referred to in the first subparagraph is collected in collecting systems.
Where Member States derogate from the deadline referred to in the first subparagraph, they shall ensure that their first national implementation programme referred to in Article 23 includes:
(a)
the number of agglomerations of 1 000 p.e. and above but below 2 000 p.e. that lack complete collecting systems on 1 January 2025; and
(b)
a plan detailing the investments necessary to reach full compliance for those agglomerations within the extended deadlines; and
(c)
the technical or economic reasons justifying the extension of the deadline referred to in the first subparagraph.
The extensions of the deadline referred to in the first subparagraph shall apply only if the conditions of the second or third subparagraph and of the fourth subparagraph are fulfilled. The Commission shall notify the Member States if those conditions are not fulfilled by 31 July 2028.
3.   The load of an agglomeration expressed in p.e. shall be calculated on the basis of the maximum average weekly load generated in that agglomeration during the year, excluding unusual weather situations such as those due to heavy rain.
4.   Collecting systems shall fulfil the requirements of Part A of Annex I.
