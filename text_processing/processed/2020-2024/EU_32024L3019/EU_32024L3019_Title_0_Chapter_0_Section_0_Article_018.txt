Article 18
Risk assessment and management
1.   By 31 December 2027, Member States shall identify and assess the risks caused by urban wastewater discharges to the environment and human health, taking into account seasonal fluctuations and extreme events, and at least the risks related to the following:
(a)
the quality of a water body used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption as defined in Article 2, point (1), of Directive (EU) 2020/2184;
(b)
the quality of bathing water falling within the scope of Directive 2006/7/EC;
(c)
the quality of a water body where aquaculture activities as defined in Article 4, point (25), of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 take place;
(d)
the status of the receiving groundwater body as defined in Article 2, point 19, of Directive 2000/60/EC as well as all other environmental objectives as stated in Article 4 of that Directive for the receiving groundwater body;
(e)
the status of the marine environment as defined in Article 3, point 5, of Directive 2008/56/EC;
(f)
the status of the receiving surface water body as defined in Article 2, point 17, of Directive 2000/60/EC as well as all other environmental objectives as stated in Article 4 of that Directive for the receiving surface water body.
2.   Where risks have been identified in accordance with paragraph 1, Member States shall adopt appropriate measures to address them, including, where appropriate, the following measures:
(a)
taking additional measures to prevent and reduce pollution from urban wastewater at source, where required to safeguard the quality of the receiving water body, to complement the measures referred to in Article 14(3);
(b)
establishing collecting systems in accordance with Article 3 for agglomerations of below 1 000 p.e.;
(c)
applying secondary treatment in accordance with Article 6 to discharges of urban wastewater from agglomerations of below 1 000 p.e.;
(d)
applying tertiary treatment in accordance with Article 7 to discharges of urban wastewater from agglomerations of below 10 000 p.e.;
(e)
applying quaternary treatment in accordance with Article 8 to discharges of urban wastewater from agglomerations of below 10 000 p.e., in particular where urban wastewater is discharged into water bodies used for abstraction of water intended for human consumption, bathing water, water bodies where aquaculture activities take place, and where treated urban wastewater is reused for agricultural purposes;
(f)
establishing integrated urban wastewater management plans in accordance with Article 5 for agglomerations of below 10 000 p.e. and adoption of measures referred to in Annex V;
(g)
applying requirements for the treatment of collected urban wastewater that are more stringent than the requirements set out in Part B of Annex I.
3.   The identification of the risks carried out in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be reviewed every six years in line with the timing of the review of the river basin management plans and starting on 31 December 2033. A summary of the identified risks accompanied with a description of the measures adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article shall be included in the appropriate river basin management plans and in the national implementation programmes referred to in Article 23 and communicated to the Commission on request. That summary shall be made available to the public.
