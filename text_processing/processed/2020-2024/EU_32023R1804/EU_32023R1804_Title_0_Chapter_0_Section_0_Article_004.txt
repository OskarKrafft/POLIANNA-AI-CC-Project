Article 4
Targets for recharging infrastructure dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles
1.   Member States shall ensure a minimum coverage of publicly accessible recharging points dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles in their territory.
To that end, Member States shall ensure that:
(a)
by 31 December 2025, along at least 15 % of the length of the TEN-T road network, publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles are deployed in each direction of travel and that each recharging pool offers a power output of at least 1 400 kW and includes at least one recharging point with an individual power output of at least 350 kW;
(b)
by 31 December 2027, along at least 50 % of the length of the TEN-T road network, publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles are deployed in each direction of travel and that each recharging pool:
(i)
along the TEN-T core road network, offers a power output of at least 2 800 kW and includes at least two recharging points with an individual power output of at least 350 kW;
(ii)
along the TEN-T comprehensive road network, offers a power output of at least 1 400 kW and includes at least one recharging point with an individual power output of at least 350 kW;
(c)
by 31 December 2030, along the TEN-T core road network, publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles are deployed in each direction of travel with a maximum distance of 60 km between them and that each recharging pool offers a power output of at least 3 600 kW and includes at least two recharging points with an individual power output of at least 350 kW;
(d)
by 31 December 2030, along the TEN-T comprehensive road network, publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles are deployed in each direction of travel with a maximum distance of 100 km between them and each recharging pool offers a power output of at least 1 500 kW and includes at least one recharging point with an individual power output of at least 350 kW;
(e)
by 31 December 2027, in each safe and secure parking area at least two publicly accessible recharging stations dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles with an individual power output of at least 100 kW are deployed;
(f)
by 31 December 2030, in each safe and secure parking area at least four publicly accessible recharging stations dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles with an individual power output of at least 100 kW are deployed;
(g)
by 31 December 2025, in each urban node publicly accessible recharging points dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles with an aggregated power output of at least 900 kW are deployed, provided by recharging stations with an individual power output of at least 150 kW;
(h)
by 31 December 2030, in each urban node publicly accessible recharging points dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles with an aggregated power output of at least 1 800 kW are deployed, provided by recharging stations with an individual power output of at least 150 kW.
2.   The calculation of the percentage of the length of TEN-T road network referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b), shall be based on the following elements:
(a)
for the calculation of the denominator: the total length of the TEN-T road network within the territory of the Member State;
(b)
for the calculation of the numerator: the cumulated length of the sections of the TEN-T road network between two publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles meeting the requirements set out in paragraph 1, points (a) or (b) respectively, excluding any sections of the TEN-T road network between two of those recharging pools that are more than 120 km apart.
3.   A single publicly accessible recharging pool dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles may be deployed along the TEN-T road network for both directions of travel provided that:
(a)
that recharging pool is easily accessible from both directions of travel;
(b)
that recharging pool is adequately signposted; and
(c)
the requirements set out in paragraph 1 in terms of the maximum distance between recharging pools, total power output of the recharging pool, number of recharging points and power output of single points applicable for a single direction of travel are complied with for both directions of travel.
4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, along roads of the TEN-T network with a total annual average daily traffic of fewer than 2 000 heavy-duty vehicles and where the deployment of infrastructure cannot be justified in socio-economic cost-benefit terms, Member States may provide that a publicly accessible recharging pool dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles serves both directions of travel provided that the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, in terms of the maximum distance between recharging pools, the total power output of the recharging pool, the number of recharging points and the power output of single recharging points applicable for a single direction of travel, are complied with, and that the recharging pool is easily accessible from both directions of travel and adequately signposted. Member States shall notify the Commission of any cases in which they have made use of the derogation referred to in this paragraph. Member States shall review those cases every two years as part of the national progress reporting referred to in Article 15.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, along roads of the TEN-T network with a total annual average daily traffic of fewer than 2 000 heavy-duty vehicles and where the deployment of infrastructure cannot be justified in socio-economic cost-benefit terms, Member States may reduce by up to 50 % the total power output of a publicly accessible recharging pool dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles required pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, provided that that recharging pool serves only one direction of travel and that the other requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, in terms of the maximum distance between recharging pools, the number of recharging points and the power output of single recharging points, are complied with. Member States shall notify the Commission of any cases in which they have made use of the derogation referred to in this paragraph. Member States shall review those cases every two years as part of the national progress reporting referred to in Article 15.
6.   By way of derogation from the requirement relating to the maximum distance of 60 km between the publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles set out in paragraph 1, point (c), of this Article, Member States may allow a longer distance, of up to 100 km, for such recharging pools along roads of the TEN-T core network with a total annual average daily traffic of fewer than 800 heavy-duty vehicles, provided that the distance between recharging pools is adequately signposted. Member States shall notify the Commission of any cases in which they have made use of the derogations referred to in this paragraph. Member States shall review those cases every two years as part of the national progress reporting referred to in Article 15.
7.   Where a Member State has notified the Commission of a case in which it has made use of a derogation referred to in paragraph 6, the requirement set out in paragraph 1, point (c), in terms of the maximum distance between recharging pools, shall be deemed to have been complied with.
8.   By way of derogation from the requirements set out in paragraph 1, points (a), (b), (c) and (d), relating to the total power output of publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles and from the requirement set out in paragraph 1, point (c), relating to the maximum distance between those recharging pools, Cyprus may submit to the Commission a reasoned request for authorisation to apply lower requirements in terms of level of total power output of publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty electric vehicles or to apply a longer maximum distance, of up to 100 km, between those recharging pools, or both, provided that such request, if authorised, would not impede the circulation of heavy-duty electric vehicles in that Member State.
The Commission shall, within six months of receipt of a reasoned request submitted pursuant to the first subparagraph, adopt a decision as justified in each case. Any authorisation granted to Cyprus pursuant to such decision shall be valid for a maximum of four years. Where Cyprus seeks to extend the validity of the authorisation, it may submit a further reasoned request to the Commission before the expiry of the authorisation.
9.   By 31 December 2030, neighbouring Member States shall ensure that the maximum distances between recharging pools referred to in paragraph 1, points (c) and (d), are not exceeded for cross-border sections of the TEN-T core road network and TEN-T comprehensive road network. Before that date, particular attention shall be paid to cross-border sections and neighbouring Member States shall make all possible efforts to respect those maximum distances as soon as they deploy the recharging infrastructure along the cross-border sections of the TEN-T road network.
