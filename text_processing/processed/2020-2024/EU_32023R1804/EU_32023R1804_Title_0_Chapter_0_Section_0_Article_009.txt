Article 9
Targets for shore-side electricity supply in maritime ports
1.   Member States shall ensure that a minimum shore-side electricity supply for seagoing container ships and seagoing passenger ships is provided in TEN-T maritime ports.
To that end, Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 31 December 2029:
(a)
TEN-T core maritime ports and TEN-T comprehensive maritime ports for which the annual number of port calls of ships that are moored at the quayside, averaged over the last three years, by seagoing container ships above 5 000 gross tonnes is above 100 are equipped to provide each year shore-side electricity supply for at least 90 % of the total number of port calls of seagoing container ships above 5 000 gross tonnes that are moored at the quayside at the maritime port concerned;
(b)
TEN-T core maritime ports and TEN-T comprehensive maritime ports for which the annual number of port calls of ships that are moored at the quayside, averaged over the last three years, by seagoing ro-ro passenger ships above 5 000 gross tonnes and seagoing high-speed passenger craft above 5 000 gross tonnes is above 40 are equipped to provide each year shore-side electricity supply for at least 90 % of the total number of port calls of seagoing ro-ro passenger ships above 5 000 gross tonnes and seagoing high-speed passenger craft above 5 000 gross tonnes that are moored at the quayside at the maritime port concerned;
(c)
TEN-T core maritime ports and TEN-T comprehensive maritime ports for which the annual number of port calls of ships that are moored at the quayside, averaged over the last three years, by seagoing passenger ships above 5 000 gross tonnes other than seagoing ro-ro passenger ships and seagoing high-speed passenger craft is above 25 are equipped to provide each year shore-side electricity supply for at least 90 % of the total number of port calls of seagoing passenger ships above 5 000 gross tonnes other than seagoing ro-ro passenger ships and seagoing high-speed passenger craft that are moored at the quayside at the maritime port concerned.
2.   The port calls of ships referred to in Article 6(5), points (a), (b), (c), (e) and (g) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the total number of port calls of ships that are moored at the quayside at the maritime port concerned under paragraph 1 of this Article.
3.   Where the TEN-T core maritime port or TEN-T comprehensive maritime port is located on an island, or in an outermost region referred to in Article 349 TFEU or on the territory of Ceuta and Melilla, which is not connected directly to the electricity grid of the mainland, or in the case of an outermost region or of Ceuta and Melilla to the electricity grid of a neighbouring country, paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply until such a connection has been completed or there is sufficient locally generated electricity capacity from non-fossil energy sources to cover the needs of the island, the outermost region or of Ceuta and Melilla, whichever is relevant.
