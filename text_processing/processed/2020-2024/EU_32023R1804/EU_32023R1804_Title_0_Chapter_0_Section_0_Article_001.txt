Article 1
Subject matter
1.   This Regulation establishes mandatory national targets leading to the deployment of sufficient alternative fuels infrastructure in the Union for road vehicles, trains, vessels and stationary aircraft. It lays down common technical specifications and requirements on user information, data provision and payment requirements for alternative fuels infrastructure.
2.   This Regulation also establishes rules for the national policy frameworks referred to in Article 14 to be adopted by the Member States, including rules for the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure in areas where no mandatory Union-wide targets are set and for reporting on the deployment of such infrastructure.
3.   This Regulation establishes a reporting mechanism to encourage cooperation and ensures robust tracking of progress. The reporting mechanism shall take the form of a structured, transparent and iterative process taking place between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of finalising the national policy frameworks, taking into account existing local and regional strategies for the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, and their subsequent implementation and corresponding Commission action to support the coherent and more rapid deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure in the Member States.
