Article 11
Targets for supply of liquefied methane in maritime ports
1.   Member States shall ensure that an appropriate number of refuelling points for liquefied methane are deployed at TEN-T core maritime ports referred to in paragraph 2 to enable seagoing ships to circulate throughout the TEN-T core network by 31 December 2024. Member States shall cooperate with neighbouring Member States where that is necessary in order to ensure adequate coverage of the TEN-T core network.
2.   Member States shall designate in their national policy frameworks TEN-T core maritime ports that provide access to the refuelling points for liquefied methane referred to in paragraph 1, taking into consideration port development, existing liquefied methane refuelling points and actual market demand, both in the short- and long-term, as well as other developments.
