Progress tracking
1.   By 31 March 2025 and by 31 March of every year thereafter, Member States shall report to the Commission the total aggregated recharging power output and the number of publicly accessible recharging points deployed and the number of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles registered on their territory on 31 December of the previous year, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex III.
2.   Without prejudice to the procedure laid down in Article 258 TFEU, where it is evident from the report referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or from any information available to the Commission that a Member State is at risk of not achieving its national targets set out in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, the Commission may issue a finding to that effect and recommend the Member State concerned to take corrective measures to achieve the national targets. Within three months following the receipt of the Commission’s findings, the Member State concerned shall notify to the Commission:
(a)
the corrective measures that it plans to implement in order to achieve the national targets set out in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, including any additional actions that the Member State intends to implement in order to achieve those targets; and
(b)
a clear timetable for actions that will enable the assessment of annual progress towards achievement of those targets.
Where the Commission finds that the corrective measures are satisfactory, the Member State concerned shall update its latest national progress report referred to in Article 15 with those corrective measures and submit it to the Commission.
The Commission shall make its recommendations and the corrective measures and additional actions by the Member State concerned publicly available.
