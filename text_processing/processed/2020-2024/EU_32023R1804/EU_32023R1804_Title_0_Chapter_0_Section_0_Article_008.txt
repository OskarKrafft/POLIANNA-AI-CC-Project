Article 8
Infrastructure for liquefied methane for road transport vehicles
Until 31 December 2024, Member States shall ensure that an appropriate number of publicly accessible refuelling points for liquefied methane are deployed, at least along the TEN-T core network, in order to allow heavy-duty motor vehicles using liquefied methane to circulate throughout the Union, where there is demand, unless the costs of doing so are disproportionate to the benefits, including environmental benefits.
