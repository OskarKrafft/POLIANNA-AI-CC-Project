Article 35
Obligations of providers of online marketplaces and online search engines
1.   The general obligations provided for in Articles 11 and 30 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 shall apply for the purposes of this Regulation.
Without prejudice to the general obligations referred to in the first subparagraph, providers of online marketplaces shall cooperate with the market surveillance authorities, at the request of those authorities and in specific cases, to facilitate any action taken to eliminate or, if that is not possible, to mitigate the non-compliance of a product that is or was offered for sale online through their services.
2.   As far as powers conferred by Member States in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 are concerned, Member States shall confer on their market surveillance authorities the power, for all products covered by a relevant delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 4, to order a provider of an online marketplace to act against one or more specific items of content referring to a non-compliant product, including by removing them. Such content shall be considered to be illegal content within the meaning of Article 3, point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. Market surveillance authorities may, in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, issue such orders.
3.   Providers of online marketplaces shall establish a single contact point for the purposes of direct communication with Member States’ market surveillance authorities in relation to compliance with this Regulation.
That single contact point may be the same contact point as that referred to in Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council (62) or Article 11(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.
