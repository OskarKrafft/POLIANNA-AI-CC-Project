Article 70
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 69(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide by means of an implementing act whether the national measure is justified or not.
That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(3).
The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators.
2.   If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly.
If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure.
3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 41 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
4.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product is attributed to shortcomings in the common specifications referred to in Article 42, the Commission shall, without delay, adopt implementing acts amending or repealing the common specifications concerned.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 73(3).
