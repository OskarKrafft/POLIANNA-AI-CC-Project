Article 28
Authorised representatives
1.   A manufacturer may, by a written mandate, appoint an authorised representative.
The obligations laid down in Article 27(1) and the drawing up of technical documentation shall not form part of the authorised representative’s mandate.
2.   An authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received from the manufacturer. The mandate shall allow the authorised representative to do at least the following:
(a)
keep the EU declaration of conformity and technical documentation at the disposal of the national market surveillance authorities for 10 years after a product covered by a delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 4 has been placed on the market or put into service unless a different period has been specified in that delegated act;
(b)
cooperate with the competent national authorities, at their request, on any measures taken with regard to cases of non-compliance of the product covered by the authorised representative’s mandate;
(c)
further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a product, in a language that can be easily understood by that authority as soon as possible and in any event within 15 days of receipt of such a request; and
(d)
terminate the mandate if the manufacturer acts contrary to its obligations under this Regulation.
