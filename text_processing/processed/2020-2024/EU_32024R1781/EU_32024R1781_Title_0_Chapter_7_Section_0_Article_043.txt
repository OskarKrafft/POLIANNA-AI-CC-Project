whether the module concerned is appropriate to the type of product and to the relevant ecodesign requirements, and proportionate to the public interest pursued;
(b)
the nature of the risks entailed by the product and the extent to which conformity assessment corresponds to the nature and degree of those risks; and

where third party involvement is mandatory, the need for the manufacturer to have a choice between quality assurance and product certification modules set out in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC.
2.   Records and correspondence relating to the conformity assessment shall be drawn up in an official language of the Member State where the notified body involved in a conformity assessment procedure referred to in paragraph 1 is established, or in a language accepted by that body.
