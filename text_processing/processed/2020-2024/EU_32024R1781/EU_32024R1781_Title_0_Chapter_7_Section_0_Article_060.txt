Article 60
Operational obligations of notified bodies
1.   Notified bodies shall carry out conformity assessments in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures provided for in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 4.
2.   Conformity assessments shall be carried out in a proportionate manner, avoiding unnecessary burdens for economic operators. Notified bodies shall perform their activities taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the degree of complexity of the product technology in question and the mass or serial nature of the production process.
In so doing they shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for the compliance of the product with the relevant requirements.
3.   Where a notified body finds that a manufacturer does not meet the relevant requirements or corresponding harmonised standards, common specifications or other technical specifications, it shall require that manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures in view of a final conformity assessment, unless the deficiencies cannot be remedied, in which case it shall not issue a certificate or approval decision.
4.   Where, in the course of the monitoring of conformity following the issue of a certificate in accordance with the conformity assessment procedures provided for in a delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 4 or approval decision, a notified body finds that a product or the manufacturer does not comply or no longer complies, it shall require the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and shall suspend or withdraw the certificate or approval decision if necessary.
5.   Where corrective measures are not taken or do not have the required effect, the notified body shall restrict, suspend or withdraw any certificates or approval decisions, as appropriate.
