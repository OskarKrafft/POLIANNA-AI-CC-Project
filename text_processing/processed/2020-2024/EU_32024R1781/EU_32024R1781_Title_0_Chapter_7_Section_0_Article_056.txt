Article 56
Notification procedure
1.   Notifying authorities may only notify conformity assessment bodies which have satisfied the requirements laid down in Article 52.
2.   Notifying authorities shall notify the Commission and the other Member States using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission.
3.   The notification shall include full details of the conformity assessment activities, the conformity assessment module or modules and product or products concerned and the relevant attestation of competence.
4.   Where a notification is not based on an accreditation certificate as referred to in Article 55(2), the notifying authority shall provide the Commission and the other Member States with documentary evidence which attests to the conformity assessment body's competence and the arrangements in place to ensure that that body will be monitored regularly and will continue to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 52.
5.   The conformity assessment body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body if the Commission or the other Member States do not raise any objections within two weeks of a notification where an accreditation certificate is used, or within two months of a notification where accreditation is not used.
Only such a body shall be considered a notified body for the purposes of this Regulation.
6.   The notification shall become valid the day after the body is included in the list of notified bodies referred to in Article 57(2) by the Commission.
The body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body only after the notification has become valid.
The Commission shall not publish a notification if it is aware or becomes aware that the relevant notified body does not meet the requirements laid down in Article 52.
7.   The Commission and the other Member States shall be notified of any subsequent relevant changes to the notification.
