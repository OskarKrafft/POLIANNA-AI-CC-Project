Article 46
Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking
1.   The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the product. Where that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the product, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents.
2.   The CE marking shall be affixed before the product is placed on the market or put into service.
3.   For a product in the production control phase in which a notified body participates, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of that notified body.
The identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under its instructions, by the manufacturer or its authorised representative.
4.   The CE marking and, where applicable, the identification number of the notified body may be followed by a pictogram or other marking indicating a special risk or use.
5.   Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and take appropriate action in the event of improper use of the CE marking.
