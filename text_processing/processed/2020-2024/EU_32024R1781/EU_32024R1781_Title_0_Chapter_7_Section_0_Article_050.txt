2.   A notifying authority shall be organised and operated so as to safeguard the objectivity and impartiality of its activities.
3.   A notifying authority shall be organised in such a way that each decision relating to notification of a conformity assessment body is taken by competent persons different from those who carried out the assessment.
4.   A notifying authority shall not offer or provide any activities that conformity assessment bodies perform, or consultancy services on a commercial or competitive basis.
