Amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC
Directive 2003/87/EC is amended as follows:
(1)
in Article 3, the following point is added:
‘(v)
“non-CO2 aviation effects” means the effects on the climate of the release, during fuel combustion, of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), soot particles, oxidised sulphur species, and effects from water vapour, including contrails, from an aircraft performing an aviation activity listed in Annex I;’;
(2)
Article 3c is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraph 2 is deleted;
(b)
the following paragraphs are added:
‘5.   The Commission shall determine the total quantity of allowances to be allocated in respect of aircraft operators for the year 2024 on the basis of the total allocation of allowances in respect of aircraft operators that were performing aviation activities listed in Annex I in the year 2023, reduced by the linear reduction factor as referred to in Article 9, and shall publish that quantity, as well as the amount of free allocation which would have taken place in 2024 under the rules for free allocation in force prior to the amendments introduced by Directive (EU) 2023/958 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*1) .
6.   For the period from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2030, a maximum of 20 million of the total quantity of allowances referred to in paragraph 5 shall be reserved in respect of commercial aircraft operators, on a transparent, equal-treatment and non-discriminatory basis, for the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and other aviation fuels that are not derived from fossil fuels, identified in a regulation on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport as counting towards reaching the minimum share of sustainable aviation fuels that aviation fuel made available to aircraft operators at Union airports by aviation fuel suppliers is required to contain under that Regulation, for subsonic flights for which allowances have to be surrendered in accordance with Article 12(3) of this Directive. Where eligible aviation fuel cannot be physically attributed in an airport to a specific flight, the allowances reserved under this subparagraph shall be available for eligible aviation fuels uplifted at that airport proportionate to the emissions from flights, of the aircraft operator from that airport, for which allowances have to be surrendered in accordance with Article 12(3) of this Directive.
The allowances reserved under the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be allocated by the Member States to cover part of or all of the price differential between the use of fossil kerosene and the use of the relevant eligible aviation fuels, taking into account incentives from the price of carbon and from harmonised minimum levels of taxation on fossil fuels. When calculating that price differential, the Commission shall take into account the technical report published by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency under a regulation on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport. Member States shall ensure the visibility of funding under this paragraph in a manner corresponding to the requirements in Article 30m(1), points (a) and (b), of this Directive.
The allowances allocated under this paragraph shall cover:
(a)
70 % of the remaining price differential between the use of fossil kerosene and hydrogen from renewable energy sources, and advanced biofuels as defined in Article 2, second paragraph, point (34), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*2), for which the emission factor is zero under Annex IV or under the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 14 of this Directive;
(b)
95 % of the remaining price differential between the use of fossil kerosene and renewable fuels of non-biological origin compliant with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, used in aviation, for which the emission factor is zero under Annex IV or under the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 14 of this Directive;
(c)
100 % of the remaining price differential between the use of fossil kerosene and any eligible aviation fuel that is not derived from fossil fuels covered by the first subparagraph of this paragraph, at airports situated on islands smaller than 10 000 km2 and with no road or rail link with the mainland, at airports which are insufficiently large to be defined as Union airports in accordance with a regulation on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport and at airports located in an outermost region;
(d)
in cases other than those referred to in points (a), (b) and (c), 50 % of the remaining price differential between the use of fossil kerosene and any eligible aviation fuel that is not derived from fossil fuels covered by the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
The allocation of allowances under this paragraph may take into account possible support from other schemes at national level.
On a yearly basis, commercial aircraft operators may apply for an allocation of allowances based on the quantity of each eligible aviation fuel referred to in this paragraph used on flights for which allowances have to be surrendered in accordance with Article 12(3) between 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2030, excluding flights for which that requirement is considered to be satisfied pursuant to Article 28a(1). If, for a given year, the demand for allowances for the use of such fuels is higher than the availability of allowances, the quantity of allowances shall be reduced in a uniform manner for all aircraft operators concerned by the allocation for that year.
The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union details of the average cost difference between fossil kerosene, taking into account incentives from the price of carbon and from harmonised minimum levels of taxation on fossil fuels, and the relevant eligible aviation fuels, on a yearly basis for the previous year.
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23 to supplement this Directive by establishing the detailed rules for the yearly calculation of the cost difference referred to in the sixth subparagraph of this paragraph, for the allocation of allowances for the use of the fuels identified in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for the calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions saved as a result of the use of fuels as reported under the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 14(1), and establishing the arrangements for taking into account incentives from the price of carbon and from harmonised minimum levels of taxation on fossil fuels.
By 1 January 2028, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation regarding the application of this paragraph and submit the results of that evaluation in a report to the European Parliament and to the Council in a timely manner. The report may, where appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal to allocate a capped and time-limited amount of allowances until 31 December 2034 to further incentivise the use of the fuels identified in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, in particular the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin compliant with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, used in aviation, for which the emission factor is zero under Annex IV or under the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 14 of this Directive.
From 1 January 2028, the Commission shall evaluate the application of this paragraph in the annual report it is required to submit pursuant to Article 10(5).
7.   In respect of flights departing from an aerodrome located in the EEA which arrive at an aerodrome located in the EEA, in Switzerland or in the United Kingdom, and which were not covered by the EU ETS in 2023, the total quantity of allowances to be allocated to aircraft operators shall be increased by the levels of allocations, including free allocation and auctioning, which would have been made if they were covered by the EU ETS in that year, reduced by the linear reduction factor as referred to in Article 9.
8.   By way of derogation from Article 12(3), Article 14(3) and Article 16, Member States shall consider the requirements set out in those provisions to be satisfied and shall take no action against aircraft operators in respect of emissions released until 31 December 2030 from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State, including another aerodrome located in the same outermost region or in another outermost region of the same Member State.
