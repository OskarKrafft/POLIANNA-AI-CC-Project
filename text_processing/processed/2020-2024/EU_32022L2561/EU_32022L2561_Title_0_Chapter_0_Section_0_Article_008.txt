2.   Holders of a CPC as referred to in Article 6 shall undergo a first course of periodic training within five years of the issue of that CPC.
Member States may reduce or extend the period of time referred to in the first subparagraph, inter alia, so that it coincides with the date of expiry of the driving licence. The period may not, however, be shorter than three years or longer than seven years.

4.   Holders of the CPC as referred to in Article 6 or the CPC as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the drivers referred to in Article 4 who have ceased the exercise of their occupation and who do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall undergo a course of periodic training before resuming the exercise of the occupation.
5.   Drivers undertaking the carriage of goods or passengers by road who have completed courses of periodic training for one of the driving licence categories provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) shall be exempt from the obligation to undergo further periodic training for any of the other categories provided for in those paragraphs.
