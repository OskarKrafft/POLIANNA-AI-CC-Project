Enforcement network
1.   For enforcement purposes, Member States shall exchange information on CPCs issued or withdrawn. For that purpose Member States shall, in cooperation with the Commission, develop an electronic network or work on an extension of an existing network, taking into account the assessment by the Commission of the most cost-effective option.
2.   The network may contain information contained in the CPCs as well as information relating to administrative procedures related to CPCs.
3.   Member States shall ensure that the processing of personal data is carried out solely for the purposes of verifying compliance with this Directive, in particular the training requirements laid down in this Directive, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10).
4.   Access to the network shall be secured. Member States may grant access only to the competent authorities responsible for the implementation of, and for the control of compliance with, this Directive.
