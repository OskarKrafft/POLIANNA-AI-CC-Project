ArticleÂ 7
Periodic training
Periodic training shall consist of training to enable holders of a CPC to update the knowledge which is essential for their work, with specific emphasis on road safety, health and safety at work, and the reduction of the environmental impact of driving.
That training shall be organised by an approved training centre, in accordance with Section 5 of Annex I. Training shall consist of classroom teaching, practical training and, if available, training by means of ICT tools or using top-of-the-range simulators. If a driver moves to another undertaking, the periodic training already undergone shall be taken into account.
Periodic training shall be designed to expand on, and to revise, some of the subjects referred to in Section 1 of Annex I. It shall cover a variety of subjects and shall always include at least one road safety related subject. The training subjects shall take into account developments in the relevant legislation and technology, and shall, as far as possible, take into account the specific training needs of the driver.
