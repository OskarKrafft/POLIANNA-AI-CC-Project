Award, complementarity and combined funding
1.   Grants under the Instrument shall be awarded and managed in accordance with Title VIII of the Financial Regulation.
2.   In accordance with point (f) of the first paragraph of Article 195 of the Financial Regulation, grants shall be awarded without a call for proposals to the entities that are eligible under Article 7 of this Regulation.

The support from the different Union programmes may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.

5.   The evaluation committee shall evaluate proposals on the basis of the award criteria, taking into account, where appropriate, the relevance of the proposed action in view of the objectives pursued, the quality of the proposed action, its impact, including its economic, social and environmental impact, and its budget and cost-effectiveness.
