the impact of the infringement on the interests of investors;
(e)
the importance of the profits gained or losses avoided by the person responsible for the infringement or the losses for third parties caused by the infringement, to the extent that they can be determined;

the level of cooperation of the person responsible for the infringement with the competent authority, without prejudice to the need to ensure disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided by that person;
(g)
previous infringements of this Regulation by the person responsible for the infringement;
(h)
any measures taken after the infringement by the person responsible for the infringement to prevent its repetition.
