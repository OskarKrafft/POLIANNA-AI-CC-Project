Disclosure, nature, enforcement and allocation of fines and periodic penalty payments
1.   ESMA shall disclose to the public every fine and periodic penalty payment that has been imposed pursuant to Articles 60 and 61, unless such disclosure to the public would seriously jeopardise the financial markets or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved. Such disclosure shall not contain personal data within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).
2.   Fines and periodic penalty payments imposed pursuant to Articles 60 and 61 shall be of an administrative nature.
3.   Fines and periodic penalty payments imposed pursuant to Articles 60 and 61 shall be enforceable.
For the purposes of enforcement of fines and periodic penalty payments, ESMA shall apply the rules of civil procedure in force in the Member State or third country in which the fine or periodic penalty payment is enforced.
4.   The amounts of the fines and periodic penalty payments shall be allocated to the general budget of the Union.
5.   Where ESMA decides to impose no fine or penalty payment upon closing an investigation, it shall inform the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, and the competent authorities of the Member State concerned accordingly and shall set out the reasons for its decision.
