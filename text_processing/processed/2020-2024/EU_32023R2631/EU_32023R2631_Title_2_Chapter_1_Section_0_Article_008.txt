Article 8
Application of the technical screening criteria and grandfathering
1.   Where issuers allocate the proceeds of European Green Bonds to the uses set out in Article 4(1) and (3), they shall ensure that:
(a)
those proceeds are allocated in alignment with the technical screening criteria applicable at the time of issuance of the bond;
(b)
where technical screening criteria are amended after the issuance of the bond, the following proceeds be allocated in alignment with the amended technical screening criteria no later than seven years after the date of application of the amended criteria:
(i)
proceeds that are not yet allocated; and
(ii)
proceeds that are covered by a CapEx plan in accordance with Article 7, that have not yet met the taxonomy requirements.
2.   Where issuers allocate proceeds in accordance with the portfolio approach, issuers shall include in their portfolio only those assets whose underlying economic activity is aligned with any technical screening criteria which were applicable at any point during the seven years prior to the date of publication of the allocation report.
3.   Where the proceeds of an outstanding bond are at risk of not being aligned with paragraph 1, point (b)(ii), the issuer shall draw up, submit to external review by an external reviewer and publish a plan for aligning them to the extent possible with the amended technical screening criteria and for mitigating to the extent possible the negative consequences of the lack of full alignment with the amended technical screening criteria. The issuer shall publish that plan before expiry of the period set out in paragraph 1, point (b).
4.   Alignment with the relevant technical screening criteria shall be demonstrated in the allocation report referred to in Article 11.
