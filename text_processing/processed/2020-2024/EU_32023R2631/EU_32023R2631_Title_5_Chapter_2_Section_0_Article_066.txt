Article 66
Registration, recognition and supervisory fees
1.   ESMA shall charge fees to external reviewers for the expenditure relating to their registration, recognition and supervision and for any costs that ESMA may incur in carrying out its tasks under this Regulation.
2.   The total fees charged by ESMA to the applicant external reviewers, registered external reviewers or recognised external reviewers in accordance with this Regulation shall cover the administrative costs incurred by ESMA in its activities in relation to the registration and supervision of all external reviewers. Concurrently, any fee shall be proportionate to the turnover of the external reviewer concerned.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, external reviewers whose annual turnover is below a certain amount may be exempted from the obligation to pay a fee, as further specified in the delegated act to be adopted by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 3.
3.   The Commission shall adopt a delegated act, in accordance with Article 68 by 21 December 2024 to supplement this Regulation by specifying, in particular, the type of fees, the matters in respect of which fees are due, the amount of the fees and the manner in which they are to be paid.
When drafting the delegated act, the Commission shall specify the threshold of the annual turnover of external reviewers at group level below which no fee is to be charged, and shall also specify the manner in which the annual turnover is to be calculated for the purposes of applying that threshold.
4.   Prior to the adoption of the delegated act referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission shall consult ESMA regarding the fees referred to in that paragraph.
