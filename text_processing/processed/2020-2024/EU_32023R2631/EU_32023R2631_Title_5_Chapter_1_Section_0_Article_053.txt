2.   Where Member States have chosen, in accordance with Article 49(5), to lay down criminal penalties for the infringements of the provisions referred to therein, their competent authorities shall provide ESMA annually with anonymised and aggregated data regarding all criminal investigations undertaken and criminal penalties imposed. ESMA shall publish data on criminal penalties imposed in an annual report.

That database shall be accessible only to competent authorities and shall be updated on the basis of the information provided by the competent authorities.
