Reduction or termination of the grants
1.   In addition to the grounds specified in Article 131(4) of the Financial Regulation, after consulting the finance partner, the Commission may reduce the amount of the grant or terminate the grant agreement if within two years from the date of signature of the grant agreement, the economically most significant supply contract, works contract or services contract has not been signed and the conclusion of such contract is envisaged pursuant to the grant agreement.
