Article 17
Evaluation
1.   Evaluations of the implementation of the Facility and its capacity to achieve the objectives set out in Article 3 shall be carried out in a sufficiently timely manner to take appropriate action.
2.   An interim evaluation shall be performed by 30 June 2025 and a report on that interim evaluation shall be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council. The interim evaluation shall in particular assess:
(a)
the extent to which the Union support provided under the Facility contributed to address the needs of territories implementing the territorial just transition plans;
(b)
how the horizontal principles referred to in Article 4 were taken into account;
(c)
the need to carry out gender impact assessment;
(d)
the application of the eligibility conditions set out in Article 9 and how the visibility obligations were applied;

on basis of the projects supported by the Facility, the extent to which the Facility contributed to the environmental objectives laid down in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), taking into account the applicable screening criteria provided for in that Regulation.
The interim evaluation report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal which takes into account, in particular, possible adjustments to the eligibility conditions.
3.   At the end of the implementation period, in any case not later than 31 December 2031, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a final evaluation report on the results and long-term impact of the Facility, which shall also assess the matters set out in paragraph 2.
