Article 42
Supervisory fees
1.   ESMA shall charge proportionate fees to ESG rating providers in accordance with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 2. Those fees shall fully cover ESMA’s necessary expenditure relating to the supervision of ESG rating providers and the reimbursement of any costs that the competent authorities might incur when carrying out tasks pursuant to this Regulation, and in particular as a result of any delegation of tasks in accordance with Article 43.
2.   The amount of an individual fee shall be proportionate to the annual net turnover of the ESG rating provider concerned.
By 2 January 2026, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 47 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the type of fees, the matters for which fees are due, the amount of the fees and the respective justification, the manner in which they are to be paid and, where applicable, the way in which ESMA is to reimburse the competent authorities in respect of any costs that they might incur when carrying out tasks pursuant to this Regulation, in particular as a result of any delegation of tasks as referred to in Article 43. Those delegated acts shall establish fees which are proportionate and appropriate to the size of ESG rating providers and to the extent of their supervision, in particular when they are categorised as small ESG rating providers.
