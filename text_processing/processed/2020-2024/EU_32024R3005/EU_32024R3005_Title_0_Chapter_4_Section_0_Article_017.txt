The ESG rating provider shall ensure that such reporting does not have any negative consequences for the person reporting.
7.   Where a rating analyst terminates his or her employment with the ESG rating provider and, within one year of that termination, joins a rated item or an issuer of a rated item the determination of an individual rating of which he or she has been directly involved in, the ESG rating provider shall review the relevant work of the rating analyst over the one-year period preceding his or her departure in order to verify whether there has been any conflict of interest.
8.   The persons referred to in paragraph 1, and persons occupying a senior management position in the ESG rating provider, shall not take up a senior management position within a rated item or an issuer of a rated item the determination of an individual rating of which they have been involved in for a period of nine months after the date of such rating.
