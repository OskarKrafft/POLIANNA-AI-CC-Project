Complaints-handling mechanism
1.   ESG rating providers shall have in place and publish on their website procedures for receiving, investigating and retaining records concerning complaints made by users of ESG ratings, by rated items and by issuers of rated items. ESG rating providers shall also clearly provide information on their website about their complaints-handling mechanism and contact details.

(a)
the ESG rating provider makes publicly available the complaints-handling policy;
(b)
complaints are investigated in a timely and fair manner and the outcome of the investigation is communicated to the complainant within a reasonable period of time, unless such communication would be contrary to objectives of public policy or to Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (40); and
(c)
the inquiry is conducted independently of any personnel who have been involved in the determination of an individual rating about which the complaint is made.

(a)
the sources of data used for an individual ESG rating, factual errors and mistakes;
