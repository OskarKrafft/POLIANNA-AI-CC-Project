an ESG rating provider to put an end to an infringement in accordance with a decision taken pursuant to Article 35(1), point (c);
(b)
the persons referred to in Article 32(1):
(i)
to supply complete information which has been requested by a decision taken pursuant to Article 32(3);

to submit to an investigation and in particular to produce complete records, data, procedures or any other material required and to complete and correct other information provided in an investigation launched by a decision taken pursuant to Article 33(3);
(iii)
to submit to an on-site inspection ordered by a decision taken pursuant to Article 34(4).
2.   A periodic penalty payment shall be effective and proportionate. ESMA shall impose the periodic penalty payment on a daily basis until the ESG rating provider or person concerned complies with the relevant decision referred to in paragraph 1.
3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the amount of the periodic penalty payments shall be 3 % of the average daily turnover in the preceding business year or, in the case of natural persons, 2 % of the average daily income in the preceding calendar year. It shall be calculated from the date stipulated in the decision imposing the periodic penalty payment.
4.   A periodic penalty payment shall be imposed for a maximum period of six months following notification of ESMA’s decision referred to in paragraph 1. Following the end of the period for which the periodic penalty payment is imposed, ESMA shall review the measure.
