Article 1
Subject matter
This Regulation introduces a common regulatory approach to enhance the integrity, transparency, comparability where possible, responsibility, reliability, good governance and independence of ESG rating activities, thereby contributing to the transparency and quality of ESG ratings and to the sustainable finance agenda of the Union. It aims to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market, while achieving a high level of consumer and investor protection and preventing greenwashing and other types of misinformation, including social washing, by introducing transparency requirements related to ESG ratings and rules on the organisation and conduct of ESG rating providers.
