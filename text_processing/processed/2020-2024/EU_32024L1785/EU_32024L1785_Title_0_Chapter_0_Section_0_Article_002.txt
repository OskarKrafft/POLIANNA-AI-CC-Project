(15)
Article 15 is replaced by the following:
‘Article 15
Emission limit values, environmental performance limit values, equivalent parameters and technical measures
1.   The emission limit values for polluting substances shall apply at the point where the emissions leave the installation, and any dilution prior to that point shall be disregarded when determining those values.
With regard to indirect releases of polluting substances into water, the effect of a waste water treatment plant outside the installation may be taken into account when determining the emission limit values of the installation concerned, provided that this does not lead to higher levels of pollution in the environment, an equivalent level of protection of the environment as a whole is guaranteed, and the operator ensures, in consultation with the operator of the waste water treatment plant, that the indirect releases do not jeopardise compliance with the provisions of the permit of the waste water treatment plant under this Directive or the specific authorisation under Directive 91/271/EEC and that all of the following requirements are fulfilled:
(a)
the released polluting substances do not impede the operation of the waste water treatment plant or the capacity to recover resources from the waste water treatment stream;
(b)
the released polluting substances do not harm the health of the staff working in collecting systems and waste water treatment plants;
(c)
the waste water treatment plant is designed and equipped to abate the released polluting substances;
(d)
the overall load of the concerned polluting substances eventually released into the water is not increased compared to the situation where the emissions from the installation concerned remained compliant with emission limit values set for direct releases in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article, without prejudice to stricter measures required pursuant to Article 18.
The competent authority shall set out in an annex to the permit conditions the reasons for the application of the second subparagraph, including the result of the assessment by the operator of the fulfilment of the required conditions.
The operator shall provide an updated assessment in cases where the permit conditions should be changed to ensure that the requirements set out in the second subparagraph, points (a) to (d) are fulfilled.
2.   Without prejudice to Article 18, the emission limit values and the equivalent parameters and technical measures referred to in Article 14(1) and (2) shall be based on BAT without prescribing the use of any technique or specific technology.
3.   The competent authority shall set the strictest achievable emission limit values by applying BAT in the installation, considering the entire range of the emission levels associated with the best available techniques (“BAT-AELs”) to ensure that, under normal operating conditions, emissions do not exceed the BAT-AELs as laid down in the decisions on BAT conclusions referred to in Article 13(5). The emission limit values shall be based on an assessment by the operator of the entire BAT-AEL range, analysing the feasibility of meeting the strictest end of the BAT-AEL range and demonstrating the best overall performance that the installation can achieve by applying BAT as described in BAT conclusions, having regard to possible cross-media effects. The emission limit values shall be set through either of the following:
(a)
setting emission limit values expressed for the same or shorter periods of time and under the same reference conditions as the BAT-AELs; or
(b)
setting emission limit values different from those referred to in point (a) in terms of values, periods of time and reference conditions.
Where the emission limit values are set in accordance with point (b), the competent authority shall, at least annually, assess the results of emission monitoring in order to ensure that emissions under normal operating conditions have not exceeded the BAT-AELs.
General binding rules referred to in Article 6 may be applied while setting relevant emission limit values in accordance with this Article.
If general binding rules are adopted, the strictest achievable emission limit values by applying BAT shall be set for categories of installations having similar characteristics that are relevant in determining the lowest emission levels achievable, considering the entire range of the BAT-AELs. The general binding rules shall be established by the Member State, based on the information in the BAT conclusions, analysing the feasibility of meeting the strictest end of the BAT-AEL range and demonstrating the best performance that those categories of installations can achieve by applying BAT as described in BAT conclusions.
4.   Without prejudice to Article 9(2), the competent authority shall set, for normal operating conditions, binding ranges for environmental performance that are not to be exceeded during one or more periods, as laid down in the decisions on BAT conclusions referred to in Article 13(5).
In addition, the competent authority shall:
(a)
set, for normal operating conditions, environmental performance limit values concerning water, having regard to possible cross-media effects, that are not to be exceeded during one or more periods, and which are not less strict than the binding ranges referred to in the first subparagraph;
(b)
set, for normal operating conditions, indicative environmental performance levels concerning waste and resources other than water, which are not less strict than the binding ranges referred to in the first subparagraph.
5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 3, and without prejudice to Article 18, the competent authority may, in specific cases, set emission limit values higher than the BAT-AELs. Such a derogation may apply only where an assessment shows that the achievement of BAT-AELs as described in BAT conclusions would lead to disproportionately higher costs compared to the environmental benefits due to:
(a)
the geographical location or the local environmental conditions of the installation concerned; or
(b)
the technical characteristics of the installation concerned.
The competent authority shall document in an annex to the permit conditions the reasons for derogating from paragraph 3, and the result of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and the justification for the conditions imposed.
The emission limit values set in accordance with the first subparagraph shall, however, not exceed the emission limit values set out in the Annexes to this Directive, where applicable.
Derogations granted in accordance with this paragraph shall respect the principles set out in Annex II. The competent authority shall ensure that the operator provides an assessment of the impact of the derogation on the concentration of the pollutants concerned in the receiving environment and in any case ensure that no significant pollution is caused and that a high level of protection of the environment as a whole is achieved. Derogations shall not be granted where they could put at risk compliance with environmental quality standards referred to in Article 18.
The competent authority shall re-assess whether derogations granted in accordance with this paragraph are justified, every four years or as part of each reconsideration of the permit conditions pursuant to Article 21, where such reconsideration occurs earlier than four years after the derogation was granted.
The Commission shall adopt an implementing act to establish a standardised methodology for assessing the disproportionality between the costs of implementation of the BAT conclusions and the potential environmental benefits referred to in the first subparagraph. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 75(2).
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, the competent authority may, in specific cases, set less strict binding ranges for environmental performance or environmental performance limit values. Such a derogation may apply only where an assessment shows that the achievement of performance levels associated with the best available techniques as described in BAT conclusions will lead to a significant negative environmental impact, including cross media effects, or a significant economic impact due to:
(a)
the geographical location or the local environmental conditions of the installation concerned; or
(b)
the technical characteristics of the installation concerned.
The competent authority shall document in an annex to the permit conditions the reasons for derogating from paragraph 4 and the result of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and the justification for the conditions imposed.
The competent authority shall ensure that operating under less strict binding ranges for environmental performance or environmental performance limit values does not cause any significant environmental impact, including depletion of water resources, and achieves a high level of protection of the environment as a whole.
The Commission shall establish, by means of implementing acts, a standardised methodology for undertaking the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 75(2).
7.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 3 and 4, and provided that no significant pollution is caused and all measures resulting in less pollution have been exhausted, the competent authority may set less strict emission limit values or environmental performance limit values in the event of a crisis due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the operator and Member States, leading to a severe disruption or shortage of:
(a)
energy supplies, provided that there is an overriding public interest in security of energy supply;
(b)
resources, materials or equipment essential for the operator to perform activities of public interest, in compliance with the applicable emission limit values or environmental performance limit values; or
(c)
essential resources, materials or equipment where the production output compensates for such shortage or disruption, for reasons of public health or public safety or for other imperative reasons of overriding public interest.
The derogation shall not be granted for more than three months. If the reasons justifying the granting of a derogation persist, the derogation may be prolonged for a maximum period of three months.
As soon as the supply conditions are restored or where there is an alternative to the energy supplies, resources, materials or equipment, the Member State shall ensure that the decision to set less strict emission limit values and environmental performance limit values ceases to have effect, and the installation shall comply with permit conditions set in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4.
The Member States shall take measures to ensure that emissions resulting from the derogation referred to in the first subparagraph are monitored.
The competent authority shall make information on the derogation and the conditions imposed publicly available in accordance with Article 24(2).
The Commission may, where necessary, assess and further clarify, through guidance, the criteria to be taken into account for the application of this paragraph.
Member States shall notify the Commission of any derogation granted under this paragraph, including the reasons justifying the granting of the derogation and the conditions imposed.
The Commission shall assess whether the derogation granted is justified having due regard to the criteria set in this paragraph. If the Commission raises objections within 2 months of the notification by the Member State, the Member States shall without delay revise the derogation accordingly.’

3.   Member States shall ensure that the penalties established pursuant to this Article give due regard to the following, as applicable:

2.   Member States shall ensure that national rules and procedures relating to claims for compensation are designed and applied in such a way that they do not render impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of the right to compensation for damage caused by an infringement pursuant to paragraph 1.
3.   Member States may establish limitation periods for bringing actions for compensation referred to in paragraph 1. Such periods shall not begin to run before the infringement has ceased and the person claiming the compensation knows or can reasonably be expected to know that he or she suffered damage from an infringement pursuant to paragraph 1.’
