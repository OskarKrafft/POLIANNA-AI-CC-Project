ensure complementarity, synergy, coherence and consistency among different instruments at Union, national and, where appropriate, regional and local level, in particular in relation to measures financed by Union funds, both in the planning phase and during implementation;
(b)
optimise mechanisms for coordination in order to avoid duplication of effort or overlaps;
(c)
ensure close cooperation between those responsible for implementation at Union, national and, where appropriate, regional and local level to deliver coherent and streamlined support actions under the instrument.
2.   The Commission shall endeavour to ensure complementarity and synergies with support provided by other relevant international organisations.
