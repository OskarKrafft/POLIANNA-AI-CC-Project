‘5.   In any given year, if the total number of allowances in circulation is between 833 million and 1 096 million, a number of allowances equal to the difference between the total number of allowances in circulation, as set out in the most recent publication as referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, and 833 million shall be deducted from the quantity of allowances to be auctioned by the Member States under Article 10(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC and shall be placed in the reserve over a period of 12 months beginning on 1 September of that year. If the total number of allowances in circulation is above 1 096 million allowances, the number of allowances to be deducted from the quantity of allowances to be auctioned by the Member States under Article 10(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC and to be placed in the reserve over a period of 12 months beginning on 1 September of that year shall be equal to 12 % of the total number of allowances in circulation. By way of derogation from the second sentence of this subparagraph, until 31 December 2030, the percentage referred to in that sentence shall be doubled.
Without prejudice to the total number of allowances to be deducted pursuant to this paragraph, until 31 December 2030, allowances referred to in Article 10(2), first subparagraph, point (b), of Directive 2003/87/EC shall not be taken into account when determining Member States’ shares contributing to that total amount.

Where fewer than 75 million allowances are in the reserve, all allowances in the reserve shall be released under this paragraph. Where the condition in Article 29a(1) of that Directive is met, the volumes to be released from the reserve in accordance with that Article shall be evenly distributed during a period of three months, starting no later than two months from the date when the condition in Article 29a(1) of that Directive is met as notified by the Commission in accordance with the fourth subparagraph thereof.’

Article 3 is replaced by the following:
‘Article 3
Review
The Commission shall monitor the functioning of the reserve in the context of the report provided for in Article 10(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC. That report should consider relevant effects on competitiveness, in particular in the industrial sector, including in relation to GDP, employment and investment indicators. Within three years of the start of the operation of the reserve and at five-year intervals thereafter, the Commission shall, on the basis of an analysis of the orderly functioning of the European carbon market, review the reserve and submit a legislative proposal, where appropriate, to the European Parliament and to the Council. Each review shall pay particular attention to the percentage figure for the determination of the number of allowances to be placed in the reserve pursuant to Article 1(5) of this Decision, the numerical value of the threshold for the total number of allowances in circulation, including with a view to a potential adjustment of that threshold in line with the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC, as well as the number of allowances to be released from the reserve pursuant to Article 1(6) or (7) of this Decision. In its review, the Commission shall also look into the impact of the reserve on growth, jobs, and the Union’s industrial competitiveness and on the risk of carbon leakage.’.
