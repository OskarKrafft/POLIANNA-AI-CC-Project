Article 20
Permanent cessation of fishing activities
1.   By way of derogation from point (e) of Article 13, the EMFAF may support compensation for the permanent cessation of fishing activities.
The support referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall contribute to the specific objective referred to in point (c) of Article 14(1).
2.   Support under this Article may be granted only under the following conditions:
(a)
the cessation is foreseen as a tool of an action plan referred to in Article 22(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;
(b)
the cessation is achieved through the scrapping of the fishing vessel or through its decommissioning and retrofitting for activities other than commercial fishing, keeping in line with the objectives of the CFP and of the multiannual plans referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;
(c)
the fishing vessel is registered as active and has carried out fishing activities at sea for at least 90 days per year during the last two calendar years preceding the date of submission of the application for support;
(d)
the equivalent fishing capacity is permanently removed from the Union fishing fleet register and the fishing licences and the fishing authorisations are permanently withdrawn, in accordance with Article 22(5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013; and
(e)
the beneficiary shall not register any fishing vessel within five years following the receipt of support.
3.   The support referred to in paragraph 1 may only be granted to:
(a)
owners of Union fishing vessels concerned by the permanent cessation; and
(b)
fishers who have worked at sea on board a Union fishing vessel concerned by the permanent cessation for at least 90 days per year during the last two calendar years preceding the year of submission of the application for support.
The fishers referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall cease all fishing activities for five years following the receipt of support. If a fisher returns to fishing activities within that period of time, sums unduly paid in respect of the operation shall be recovered by the Member State concerned, in an amount proportionate to the period during which the condition set out in the first sentence of this subparagraph has not been fulfilled.
