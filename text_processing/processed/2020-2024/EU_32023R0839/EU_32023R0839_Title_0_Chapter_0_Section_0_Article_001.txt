Commitments and targets
1.   For the period from 2021 to 2025, taking into account the flexibilities provided for in Articles 12, 13 and 13a, each Member State shall ensure that greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed greenhouse gas removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals on its territory in all of the land accounting categories referred to in Article 2(1).
2.   The 2030 Union target for net greenhouse gas removals shall be 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent as a sum of the values of the greenhouse gas net emissions and removals by Member States in 2030 set out in column D of Annex IIa, and shall be based on the average of its greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 as submitted in 2020.
3.   Each Member State shall ensure that, taking into account the flexibilities provided for in Articles 12 and 13b, the sum of its greenhouse gas emissions and removals on its territory and in all of the land reporting categories referred to in Article 2(2), points (a) to (j), reported for the year 2030 in its greenhouse gas inventory submitted in 2032, compared to the average of its greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 as submitted in 2032, does not exceed the target set out for that Member State in column C of Annex IIa.
4.   Each Member State shall ensure that the sum of the differences between the following points for each year in the period from 2026 to 2029 does not exceed the budget for 2026 to 2029:
(a)
its greenhouse gas emissions and removals on its territory and in all of the land reporting categories referred to in Article 2(2), points (a) to (j); and
(b)
the average value for its greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, as submitted in 2032.
The budget for 2026 to 2029 shall be defined as the sum of the differences for each year in the period from 2026 to 2029 for that Member State between:
(a)
annual greenhouse gas emission and removal limit values for those years, established on the basis of a linear trajectory towards 2030; and
(b)
the average value for its greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, as submitted in 2025.
The linear trajectory of a Member State shall start in 2022 at the average value for greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, and have as its end point for 2030 the value obtained by adding the value set out for that Member State in column C of Annex IIa to the average value for greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.
The budget for 2026 to 2029 shall be defined on the basis of the greenhouse gas inventory data submitted in 2025 and the compliance with this budget shall be assessed on the basis of the greenhouse gas inventory data submitted in 2032.
5.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out the annual limit values based on the linear trajectory for net greenhouse gas removals for each Member State, for each year in the period from 2026 to 2029 in terms of tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Those national trajectories shall be based on the average greenhouse gas inventory data for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, reported by each Member State.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16a of this Regulation. For the purpose of those implementing acts, the Commission shall carry out a comprehensive review of the most recent national inventory data submitted by Member States pursuant to Article 26(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.
6.   When adopting policies to comply with their commitments, targets and budgets as referred to in this Article, Member States shall consider the need to ensure a just and socially fair transition for all. The Commission may issue guidance to support Member States in that regard.’
(5)
in Article 5, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:

Member States shall denote emissions by a positive sign (+) and removals by a negative sign (-).’
(6)
in Article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:
‘1.   Member States shall account for emissions and removals resulting from afforested land and deforested land calculated as the total emissions and total removals for each of the years in the period from 2021 to 2025.

2.   Each Member State shall account for emissions and removals resulting from managed grassland calculated as emissions and removals in the period from 2021 to 2025 minus the value obtained by multiplying by five the Member State’s average annual emissions and removals resulting from managed grassland in its base period from 2005 to 2009.
3.   During the period from 2021 to 2025, each Member State that includes managed wetland in the scope of its commitments shall account for emissions and removals resulting from managed wetland, calculated as emissions and removals in that period minus the value obtained by multiplying by five the Member State’s average annual emissions and removals resulting from managed wetland in its base period from 2005 to 2009.’

The Commission shall publish the proposed forest reference levels communicated to it by Member States.
8.   Based on the proposed forest reference levels submitted by Member States, on the technical assessment carried out pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Article and, where applicable, on the revised proposed forest reference level submitted under paragraph 7 of this Article, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 amending Annex IV with a view to laying down the forest reference levels to be applied by the Member States for the period from 2021 to 2025.
9.   If a Member State does not submit its forest reference level to the Commission by the dates specified in paragraph 3 of this Article and, where applicable, paragraph 7 of this Article, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 16 amending Annex IV with a view to laying down the forest reference level to be applied by that Member State for the period from 2021 to 2025, based on any technical assessment carried out pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Article.
