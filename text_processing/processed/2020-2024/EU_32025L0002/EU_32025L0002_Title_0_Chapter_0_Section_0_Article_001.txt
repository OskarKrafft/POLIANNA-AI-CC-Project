‘Article 77a
Extrapolation of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure
1.   The determination of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure referred to in Article 77(2) shall make use of, and be consistent with, information derived from relevant financial instruments. That determination shall take into account relevant financial instruments of those maturities where the markets for those financial instruments are deep, liquid and transparent. For maturities beyond the first smoothing point, the relevant risk-free interest rate shall be extrapolated in accordance with the third subparagraph. The first smoothing point for a currency shall be the longest maturity for which the following conditions are met:
(a)
the markets for financial instruments of that maturity are deep, liquid and transparent;
(b)
the percentage of outstanding bonds of that or a longer maturity among all outstanding bonds denominated in that currency is sufficiently high.
The extrapolated part of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure shall be based on forward rates converging smoothly from the applicable forward rate at the first smoothing point to an ultimate forward rate (UFR).
The extrapolated forward rate shall be equal to a weighted average of a liquid forward rate and the UFR. The liquid forward rate shall be based on one or a set of forward rates in relation to the longest maturities for which the relevant financial instrument can be observed in a deep, liquid and transparent market. For maturities of at least 40 years past the first smoothing point the weight of the UFR shall be at least 77,5 %.
The extrapolated part of the relevant risk-free interest rates shall take into account information from financial instruments other than bonds where the markets for those financial instruments are deep, liquid and transparent.
2.   Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may, subject to prior approval by their supervisory authority, apply the phasing-in mechanism set out in the second subparagraph.
The phasing-in mechanism referred to in the first subparagraph shall consist of the following:
(a)
on 30 January 2027, the parameters determining the speed of the convergence of the forward rates towards the ultimate forward rate of the extrapolation shall be set such that the risk-free interest rate term structure is sufficiently similar to the risk-free interest rate term structure on that date determined in line with the rules for the extrapolation applicable on 29 January 2027;
(b)
the parameters determining the speed of the convergence of the forward rates towards the ultimate forward rate of the extrapolation shall be decreased linearly at the beginning of each calendar year, such that the final parameters of the extrapolation are applied as of 1 January 2032.
The phasing-in mechanism referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not affect the determination of the depth, liquidity and transparency of financial markets and the first smoothing point referred to in paragraph 1.
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings applying the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph shall within the part of their report on their solvency financial condition consisting of information targeted at market professionals referred to in Article 51(1b) publicly disclose:
(a)
the fact that they apply the phasing-in mechanism for extrapolation; and
(b)
the quantification of the impact of not applying the phasing-in mechanism on their financial position.
3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, on 28 January 2025, the first smoothing point for the euro, shall be at a maturity of 20 years.’

(41)
Article 77d is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraphs 1 to 4 are replaced by the following:
‘1.   Member States shall ensure that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking may apply a volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure to calculate the best estimate referred to in Article 77(2) subject to prior approval by the supervisory authorities where at least the following conditions are met:
(a)
the volatility adjustment for a given currency is applied in the calculation of the best estimate of all insurance and reinsurance obligations of the undertaking denominated in that currency where the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure used to calculate the best estimate for those obligations does not include a matching adjustment as referred to in Article 77b;
(b)
the undertaking demonstrates to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority that it has adequate processes in place to calculate the volatility adjustment pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article.
1a.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, insurance and reinsurance undertakings that applied a volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure to calculate the best estimate referred to in Article 77(2) before 29 January 2026 may, without prior approval by the supervisory authority, continue applying a volatility adjustment provided that they comply with the conditions for prior approval under paragraph 1 of this Article as of 30 January 2027.
1b.   Member States shall ensure that supervisory authorities have the power to require an insurance or reinsurance undertaking to stop applying a volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure to calculate the best estimate referred to in Article 77(2) where the undertaking no longer meets the conditions for prior approval laid down by national law in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article. When an undertaking restores compliance with those conditions, it may request prior approval from the supervisory authorities to apply a volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure to calculate the best estimate pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.
1c.   Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may, subject to prior approval by the supervisory authority, apply an undertaking-specific adjustment to the risk-corrected spread of the currency referred to in paragraph 3, where:
(a)
the risk-corrected spread exceeded the risk-corrected spread calculated on the basis of the undertaking’s portfolio of investments in debt instruments for the four quarterly reporting periods prior to the reporting date; and
(b)
the information that is inherent to the relevant assets of the undertaking and that is reported by the undertaking in line with Article 35(1) to (4) is of sufficient quality to allow a robust and reliable calculation of that adjustment.
The adjustment shall correspond to the lower of 105 % and the ratio of the risk-corrected spread calculated based on the undertaking’s portfolio of investments in debt instruments and the risk-corrected spread calculated on the basis of the reference portfolio for the relevant currency. The risk-corrected spread based on the undertaking’s portfolio of investments in debt instruments shall be calculated in the same manner as the risk-corrected spread based on the reference portfolio for the relevant currency, but using undertaking-specific data on the weights and the average duration of the relevant sub-classes within the undertaking’s portfolio of investments in debt instruments for the relevant currency.
Where the adjustment is applied, the volatility adjustment shall not be increased by the macro volatility adjustment referred to in paragraph 4.
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall immediately stop applying the adjustment when it increases the risk-corrected spread of the currency referred to in paragraph 3 for two consecutive quarterly reporting periods.
2.   For each relevant currency, the volatility adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure shall be based on the spread between the interest rate that could be earned from a reference portfolio of investments in debt instruments for that currency and the rates of the relevant basic risk-free interest rate term structure for that currency.
The reference portfolio of investments in debt instruments for a currency shall be representative for the assets which are denominated in that currency and in which insurance and reinsurance undertakings invest to cover the best estimate for insurance and reinsurance obligations denominated in that currency.
3.   The amount of the volatility adjustment to risk-free interest rates for a currency shall be calculated as follows:


VAcu= 85 % · CSSRcu · RCScu



where:
(a)


VAcu

 is the volatility adjustment for a currency 
cu
;
(b)


CSSRcu

 is the credit spread sensitivity ratio of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking for the currency 
cu
;
(c)


RCScu

 is the risk-corrected spread for the currency 
cu
.


VAcu

 shall apply to the relevant risk-free interest rates of the term structure that are not derived by means of extrapolation in accordance with Article 77a. Where the extrapolated part of the relevant risk-free interest rates takes into account information from financial instruments other than bonds pursuant to Article 77a(1), 
VAcu

 shall also apply to risk-free interest rates derived from those financial instruments. The extrapolation of the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure shall be based on those adjusted risk-free interest rates.


CSSRcu

 shall not be negative and not be higher than one. It shall take values lower than one where the sensitivity of the assets of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking in a currency to changes in credit spreads is lower than the sensitivity of the technical provisions of that undertaking in that currency to changes in interest rates.


RCScu

 shall be calculated as the difference between the spread referred to in paragraph 2 and the portion of that spread that is attributable to a realistic assessment of expected losses or unexpected credit or other risk of the assets.
The portion of the spread that is attributable to a realistic assessment of expected losses, unexpected credit risk or any other risk shall be calculated as a percentage of spreads. That percentage shall decrease as spreads increase and shall at least differentiate the following three cases:
(a)
where spreads do not exceed their long-term average;
(b)
where spreads exceed their long-term average but do not exceed twice their long-term average;
(c)
where spreads exceed twice their long-term average.
The risk correction shall never exceed an appropriate percentage of the long-term average spreads.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, insurance and reinsurance undertakings having their head office in a Member State with a currency pegged to the euro which complies with the detailed criteria for the adjustments for currencies pegged to the euro for the purpose of facilitating the calculation of the currency risk sub-module, as established pursuant to Article 111(1), point (p), when calculating the volatility adjustment to risk-free interest rates for the pegged currency and the volatility adjustment to risk-free interest rates for the euro, shall be allowed to calculate a single 
CSSRcu

 for both their local currency and the euro, by jointly taking into account the assets and liabilities denominated in euro and their local currency.
4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1c, the volatility adjustment for the euro shall be increased by a macro volatility adjustment. The macro volatility adjustment shall be calculated as follows:


VAEuro,macro= 85 %·CSSREuro·max(RCSco- 1,3·RCSEuro;0)·ωco



where:
(a)


VAEuro,macro

 is the macro volatility adjustment for a country 
co
;
(b)


CSSREuro

 is the credit spread sensitivity ratio of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking for the euro;
(c)


RCSco

 is the risk-corrected spread for the country 
co
;
(d)


RCSEuro

 is the risk-corrected spread for the euro;
(e)


ωco

 is the country adjustment factor for country 
co
.


CSSREuro

 shall be calculated as the credit spread sensitivity ratio of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking for the euro in accordance with paragraph 3.


RCSco

 shall be calculated in the same way as the risk-corrected spread for the euro under paragraph 3, but based on a reference portfolio that is representative for the assets which insurance and reinsurance undertakings are investing in to cover the best estimate for insurance and reinsurance obligations of products sold in the insurance market of that country and denominated in euro.


RCSEuro

 is calculated as the risk-corrected spread for the euro in accordance with paragraph 3.
The country adjustment factor referred to in the first subparagraph, point (e), shall be calculated as follows:


ωco= max(min

(((RCSco*-0,6 %)/0,3 %);1);0)


Where 
RCSco*
 is the risk-corrected spread for the country 
co
 as referred to in the first subparagraph, point (c), multiplied by the percentage of investments in debt instruments relative to total assets held by insurance and reinsurance undertakings authorised in country 
co
.
4a.   To calculate the spread underlying the volatility adjustment, for each currency and each country, the spread referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 shall be the value weighted sum of the average currency spread on government bonds and the average currency spread on bonds other than government bonds, loans, and securitisations. For the purposes of that calculation, the respective weights shall be the ratio of the value of government bonds included in the reference portfolio of assets for that currency or country and the value of all assets included in that reference portfolio, and the ratio of the value of bonds other than government bonds, loans and securitisations included in the reference portfolio of assets for that currency or country and the value of all assets included in that reference portfolio.’

Long-term equity investments
1.   By way of derogation from Article 101(3), and as part of the equity risk sub-module referred to in Article 105(5), second subparagraph, point (b), Member States shall allow insurance and reinsurance undertakings which comply with the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of this paragraph, to apply to a specific subset of equity investments held with a long-term perspective a capital requirement in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, a sub-set of equity investments may be treated as long-term equity investments if the insurance or reinsurance undertaking demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority, that all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the sub-set of equity investments is clearly identified and managed separately from the other activities of the undertaking;
(b)
a policy for long-term investment management is set up for each long-term equity portfolio and reflects the undertaking’s commitment to hold the overall exposure to equity in the sub-set of equity investment for a period that exceeds five years on average. The administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking shall explicitly endorse the investment management policies and those policies are frequently reviewed against the actual management of the portfolios, and reported in the own-risk and solvency assessment of the undertaking referred to in Article 45;
(c)
the sub-set of equity investments consists only of equities that are listed in countries that are member of the EEA or of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) or of unlisted equities of companies that have their head offices in countries that are member of the EEA or of the OECD;
(d)
on an ongoing basis and under stressed conditions, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is able to avoid forced selling of equity investments within the sub-set for five years;
(e)
the risk management, asset-liability management and investment policies of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking reflect the undertaking’s intention to hold the sub-set of equity investments for a period that is compatible with the requirement laid down in point (b) and the undertaking’s ability to meet the requirement laid down in point (d);
(f)
the sub-set of equity investments is appropriately diversified in such a way as to avoid excessive reliance on any particular issuer or group of undertakings and excessive accumulation of risk in the portfolio of long-term equity investments as a whole with the same risk profile;
(g)
the sub-set of equity investments does not include participations.
2.   Where equities are held within European long-term investment funds or within certain types of collective investment undertaking, including alternative investment funds, which are identified in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Directive as having a lower risk profile, the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 may be assessed at the level of the funds and not of the underlying assets held within those funds.
3.   Insurance or reinsurance undertakings that treat a sub-set of equity investments as long-term equity investments in accordance with paragraph 1 shall not revert back to an approach that does not include long-term equity investments.
Where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that treats a sub-set of equity investments as long-term equity investments no longer complies with the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, it shall immediately inform the supervisory authority and take the necessary measures to restore compliance.
Within one month of the date of the first observation of non-compliance with the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall provide the supervisory authority with the necessary information and the actions to be taken by the undertaking to achieve, within six months of the date of the first observation of non-compliance, the re-establishment of compliance with those conditions.
Where the undertaking is not able to restore compliance within six months of the date of the first observation of non-compliance, it shall cease to classify any equity investment as a long-term equity investment in accordance with this Article for a period of two and a half years, or as long as compliance with the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 is not restored, whichever period is longer.

Simplifications in the standard formula
1.   Insurance and reinsurance undertakings may use a simplified calculation for a specific risk module or risk sub-module where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
the nature, scale and complexity of the risks they face justifies the use of a simplified calculation;
(b)
it would be disproportionate to require the insurance or reinsurance undertaking to apply the standardised calculation;
(c)
the error compared to the standardised calculation does not lead to a material misstatement of the Solvency Capital Requirement, except in cases where the simplified calculation leads to a Solvency Capital Requirement which exceeds the Solvency Capital Requirement that results from the standardised calculation.
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, small and non-complex undertakings may use a simplified calculation for a specific risk module or risk sub-module where they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority and at least every five years that the following conditions are met:
(a)
each individual risk module or risk sub-module for which a simplified calculation is intended to be used, represents, without applying the simplification, less than 2 % of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement;
(b)
the sum of all risk modules or risk sub-modules for which a simplified calculation is intended to be used, represents, without applying the simplification, less than 10 % of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement.
For the purposes of this paragraph, simplified calculations shall be calibrated in accordance with Article 101(3).
2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Article and to Article 102(1), where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking calculates the Solvency Capital Requirement and a risk module or risk sub-module does not represent a share of more than 5 % of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 103, point (a), the undertaking may use a simplified calculation for that risk module or risk sub-module during a period of no more than three years following that calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the sum of the shares, relative to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement, of each risk module or risk sub-module where the simplified calculations pursuant to that paragraph are applied shall not exceed 10 %.
The share of a risk module or risk sub-module relative to the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be that share as calculated the last time when the risk module or risk sub-module was calculated without a simplified calculation pursuant to paragraph 2.’

(m)
the approach to be used with respect to qualifying holdings within the meaning of Article 13, point (21), in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement, in particular the calculation of the equity risk sub-module referred to in Article 105(5), taking into account the likely reduction in the volatility of the value of those qualifying holdings arising from the strategic nature of those investments and the influence exercised by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking on those investees;’

Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, the calculation of the interest rate risk sub-module shall not be required to take into account the risk of interest rates falling to levels below a negative floor where a negative floor is determined such that the likelihood of interest rates across relevant currencies and across maturities not being at all times above the negative floor is sufficiently small.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (h), of this paragraph, the methods and adjustments to be used to reflect the reduced scope for risk diversification of insurance and reinsurance undertakings relating to ring-fenced funds shall not apply to the portfolios of assets that are not ring-fenced funds and that are assigned to cover a corresponding best estimate of insurance or reinsurance obligations as referred to in Article 77b(1), point (a).’

‘3.   By 29 January 2030, and every five years thereafter, EIOPA shall carry out an assessment of the appropriateness of the methods, assumptions, and standard parameters used when calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement on the basis of the standard formula. It shall, in particular, take into account the performance of any asset class and financial instruments, the behaviour of investors in those asset classes and financial instruments as well as developments in international standard setting in financial services. The review of certain risks and certain asset classes may be prioritised. On the basis of EIOPA’s assessment, the Commission shall present, where appropriate, proposals for the amendment of this Directive, or of delegated or implementing acts adopted pursuant thereto.
Insurance and reinsurance undertakings applying the phasing-in referred to in paragraph 2a of this Article shall within the part of their report on their solvency financial condition consisting of information targeted at market professionals referred to in Article 51(1b) publicly disclose:

the method to take into account the effect of credit spread movements on the volatility adjustment for a currency does neither take into account the undertaking-specific adjustment of the risk-corrected spread pursuant to Article 77d(1c) nor, in the case of the euro, a possible increase of the volatility adjustment by a macro volatility adjustment pursuant to Article 77d(4);
(b)
the Solvency Capital Requirement is not lower than any of the following:
(i)
a notional Solvency Capital Requirement calculated as the Solvency Capital Requirement, except that the effect of credit spread movements on the volatility adjustment is taken into account in accordance with the methodology used by EIOPA for the purposes of the publication of technical information pursuant to Article 77e(1), point (c);
(ii)
a notional Solvency Capital Requirement calculated in accordance with point (i) of this point, except that the representative portfolio for a currency referred to in Article 77d(2), second subparagraph, is determined on the basis of the assets in which the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is investing instead of the assets of all insurance or reinsurance undertakings with insurance or reinsurance obligations denominated in that currency.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (b), the determination of the representative portfolio for a given currency shall be based on the undertaking’s assets denominated in that currency and used to cover the best estimate for insurance and reinsurance obligations denominated in that currency.’

7.   For the purposes of paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Article, macroeconomic and financial markets’ developments as well as macroprudential concerns shall have the same meaning as in Article 45.

Supervisory powers to remedy liquidity vulnerabilities in exceptional circumstances
1.   As part of the regular supervisory review process, supervisory authorities shall monitor the liquidity position of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Where they identify material liquidity risks, they shall inform the insurance or reinsurance undertaking concerned thereof. The insurance or reinsurance undertaking shall explain how it intends to address those liquidity risks.
2.   Member States shall ensure that supervisory authorities have the necessary powers to require undertakings to reinforce their liquidity position when material liquidity risks or deficiencies are identified. Such powers shall be applied where there is sufficient evidence regarding the existence of material liquidity risks and the absence of effective remedies taken by the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.
The measures taken by a supervisory authority on the basis of this paragraph shall be reviewed by it at least every six months and be removed when the undertaking has taken effective remedies.
Where relevant, the supervisory authority shall share the evidence of vulnerabilities in terms of liquidity risks with EIOPA.
3.   Member States shall ensure that, in relation to individual undertakings facing material liquidity risks that may cause an imminent threat to the protection of policy holders or to the stability of the financial system, supervisory authorities have the power to temporarily:

restrict or suspend dividend distributions to shareholders and other subordinated creditors;
(b)
restrict or suspend other payments to shareholders and other subordinated creditors;
(c)
restrict or suspend share buy-backs and repayment or redemption of own fund items;
(d)
restrict or suspend bonuses or other variable remuneration;
(e)
suspend redemption rights of life insurance policy holders (“redemption rights”).
The power to suspend redemption rights shall only be exercised in exceptional circumstances which affect the undertaking, as a last resort measure and where that is in the collective interest of policy holders and beneficiaries of the undertaking. Before exercising that power, the supervisory authority shall take into account potential unintended effects on financial markets and on the rights of policy holders and beneficiaries of the undertaking, including in a cross-border context. Supervisory authorities shall make public their reasons for the application of that power.
The application of any measure referred to in the first subparagraph shall last no more than three months. Member States shall ensure that a measure can be renewed if the reasons that justify it are still present and that it is no longer applied when those reasons are no longer present.
Without prejudice to Article 144c(6), Member States shall ensure that, until the suspension of redemption rights is lifted by the supervisory authorities, insurance and reinsurance undertakings concerned do not:
(a)
make any distributions or other payments to shareholders or other subordinated creditors;
(b)
proceed with share buy-backs or repay or redeem any own fund items; or
(c)

If, within the two-month period referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph, any of the supervisory authorities concerned has referred the matter to EIOPA in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010, the supervisory authority of the home Member State shall defer the adoption of the final conclusions of the joint on-site inspection and await any decision that EIOPA may take in accordance with Article 19(3) of that Regulation, and shall adopt the conclusions in conformity with EIOPA’s decision. All supervisory authorities concerned shall recognise those conclusions as determinative.
6.   Where the supervisory authority of the home Member State refuses to carry out a joint on-site inspection, it shall explain in writing the reasons for such refusal to the supervisory authority of the host Member State.
Where supervisory authorities disagree with the reasons for refusal, they may refer the matter to EIOPA and request its assistance in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 within one month of the notification of the decision by the supervisory authority of the home Member State.

Impediments to group supervision
1.   In the cases referred to in Article 213(2), point (b), the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company shall ensure that:
(a)
the internal arrangements and distribution of tasks within the group are adequate for the purpose of complying with this Title and, in particular, are effective to:
(i)
coordinate all the subsidiary undertakings of the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company, including, where necessary, through an adequate distribution of tasks among those undertakings;
(ii)
prevent or manage intra-group conflicts; and
(iii)
enforce the group-wide policies set by the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company throughout the group;
(b)
the structural organisation of the group of which the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company is part does not obstruct or otherwise prevent the effective supervision of the group and its subsidiary insurance and reinsurance undertakings, taking into account, in particular:
(i)
the position of the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company in a multi-layered group;
(ii)
the shareholding structure; and

the role of the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company within the group.
2.   Where the conditions set out in paragraph 1, point (a), are not satisfied, the group supervisor shall have the power to require the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding companies to change internal arrangements and distributions of tasks within the group.
Where the conditions set out in paragraph 1, point (b), of this Article are not satisfied, the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company shall be subject to appropriate supervisory measures by the group supervisor to ensure or restore, as the case may be, continuity and integrity of group supervision and compliance with the requirements laid down in this Title.

Supervisory authorities shall only exercise that power in exceptional circumstances, after consulting EIOPA and, where applicable, other supervisory authorities concerned, and shall provide the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company with a justification thereof.
3.   In the cases referred to in Article 213(2), points (a) and (b), of this Directive, where the structural organisation of a group which consists of undertakings linked to each other by a relationship as set out in Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU and their related undertakings, or which is identified on the basis of Article 212(3) of this Directive, is such that it obstructs or prevents the effective supervision of that group or it prevents that group from complying with this Title, the group shall be subject to appropriate supervisory measures to ensure or restore, as the case may be, continuity and integrity of group supervision and compliance with this Title. In particular, Member States shall ensure that supervisory authorities when acting as group supervisors in accordance with Article 247 of this Directive have the power to require the establishment of an insurance holding company or a mixed financial holding company which has its head office in the Union, or the establishment of an undertaking in the Union which effectively exercises, through centralised coordination, a dominant influence over the decisions, including financial decisions, of the insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are part of the group. In that case, that insurance holding company, mixed financial holding company or undertaking which effectively exercises centralised coordination shall be responsible for complying with this Title.’
(72)
Article 214 is amended as follows:
(a)
paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
‘1.   The exercise of group supervision in accordance with Article 213 shall not imply that the supervisory authorities are required to play a supervisory role in relation to the third-country insurance undertaking, the third-country reinsurance undertaking or the mixed-activity insurance holding company taken individually.
For the sole purpose of ensuring compliance with this Title, the exercise of group supervision may imply direct supervision and the exercise of supervisory powers over insurance holding companies and mixed financial holding companies by supervisory authorities.’
(b)
in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is inserted after the first subparagraph:

                                             ‘When assessing whether an undertaking is of negligible interest with respect to the objectives of group supervision pursuant to the first subparagraph, point (b), the group supervisor shall ensure that the following conditions are met:
(a)
the size of the undertaking, in terms of total assets and of technical provisions, is small in comparison with that of other undertakings of the group and the group as a whole;
(b)
the exclusion of the undertaking from the scope of group supervision would have no material impact on the group solvency;
(c)
the qualitative and quantitative risks, including those stemming from intragroup transactions, that the undertaking poses or may pose to the whole group, are immaterial.’
(c)
the following paragraphs are added:
‘3.   Where the exclusion of one or more undertakings from the scope of group supervision in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article would result in a case that would not trigger the application of group supervision under Article 213(2), points (a), (b), and (c), the group supervisor shall consult EIOPA and, where applicable, other supervisory authorities concerned before taking the decision on exclusion. Such decision shall only be taken in exceptional circumstances and shall be duly justified to EIOPA and, where applicable, to the other supervisory authorities concerned. The group supervisor shall reassess at least annually whether its decision remains appropriate. Where that is no longer the case, the group supervisor shall notify EIOPA and, where applicable, the other supervisory authorities concerned that it will start exercising group supervision.
Before excluding the ultimate parent undertaking from group supervision pursuant to paragraph 2, first subparagraph, point (b), the group supervisor shall consult EIOPA, and where applicable, other supervisory authorities concerned, and shall assess the impact of exercising group supervision at the level of an intermediate participating undertaking on the solvency position of the group. In particular, such an exclusion shall not be possible if it would result in a material improvement in the solvency position of the group.
In order to ensure the coherent and consistent application of this paragraph, EIOPA shall issue guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 to further specify the exceptional circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph or the cases where it may be justified to exclude the ultimate parent undertaking, including insurance holding companies, from the scope of group supervision.
4.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the scope of the group to which group supervision applies pursuant to Article 213(2) shall be identified in accordance with Article 212.
Where a group subject to group supervision pursuant to Article 213(2), points (a), (b) and (c), is identified in accordance with Article 212(2) and (3), and where a parent undertaking or a subsidiary undertaking of that group is also the ultimate participating undertaking of another group within the meaning of Article 212(1), point (c), that other group shall be considered to be included within the scope of the group identified in accordance with Article 212(2) and (3).
Supervisory authorities may apply Article 212(2) and (3) to extend the scope of a group within the meaning of Article 212(1), point (c).
5.   Where a group identified in accordance with Article 212(3) is subject to group supervision in accordance with Article 213(2), points (a), (b) and (c), the group shall designate one of the undertakings that are managed on a unified basis as a parent undertaking which shall be responsible for complying with this Title. The other undertakings referred to in Article 212(3), first subparagraph, shall be considered to be subsidiary undertakings.
6.   Where the designation of the parent undertaking in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article would imply significant obstacles to the exercise of group supervision, in particular in cases where the head office of the undertaking is not established in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory authority acting as the group supervisor in accordance with Article 247, or where the designation would result in the inability of the group to effectively comply with this Title, Member States shall ensure that the supervisory authority acting as the group supervisor has the power to require, after consulting other supervisory authorities concerned, the designation of another parent undertaking. The decision to designate another parent undertaking shall be duly justified by the supervisory authority acting as the group supervisor to the group and to other supervisory authorities concerned.
Where a group identified in accordance with Article 212(3) which is subject to group supervision in accordance with Article 213(2), points (a), (b) and (c), fails to designate a parent undertaking in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article, the supervisory authority acting as the group supervisor in accordance with Article 247 shall designate, after consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned, a parent undertaking which will be responsible for complying with this Title. The other undertakings in such a group shall be considered to be subsidiary undertakings.
When designating a parent undertaking in accordance with the first or second subparagraph of this paragraph, the supervisory authority acting as the group supervisor in accordance with Article 247 shall consider the following factors:
(a)
the amount of technical provisions of each undertaking;
(b)
the annual gross written premiums of each undertaking;
(c)
the number of related insurance or reinsurance undertakings of each undertaking.
Supervisory authorities shall assess at least annually whether the designation remains appropriate. Where this is not the case, the supervisory authority acting as the group supervisor in accordance with Article 247 shall designate another parent undertaking after consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned. That other parent undertaking shall be responsible for complying with this Title.’

(c)

Simplified calculations
1.   For the purposes of Article 230, the group supervisor, after consulting the other supervisory authorities concerned, may allow the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking to apply a simplified approach to participations in related undertakings that are immaterial.
The application of the simplified approach referred to in the first subparagraph to one or several related undertakings shall be duly justified by the participating undertaking to the group supervisor, considering the nature, scale and complexity of the risks of the related undertaking or undertakings.
Member States shall require the participating undertaking to assess, on an annual basis, whether the use of the simplified approach is still justified, and to publicly disclose, in its report on solvency and financial condition at the level of the group as referred to in Article 256(1), the list and size of the related undertakings subject to that simplified approach.
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the participating insurance and reinsurance undertaking shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the group supervisor, that the application of the simplified approach to participations in one or several related undertakings is sufficiently prudent to avoid an underestimation of risks stemming from that undertaking or from those undertakings when calculating the group solvency.
When applied to a third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking which has its head office in a country that is not equivalent or provisionally equivalent within the meaning of Article 227, the simplified approach shall not result in a contribution of the related undertaking to the group Solvency Capital Requirement that is lower than the capital requirement of that related undertaking, as laid down by the third country concerned.
The simplified approach shall not be applied to a related third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, where the participating insurance or reinsurance undertaking has no reliable information on the capital requirement as laid down in that third country.
3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, related undertakings shall be deemed immaterial where the book value of each of them represents less than 0,2 % of the group’s assets calculated on the basis of consolidated data and the sum of the book values of all such undertakings represents less than 0,5 % of the group’s assets calculated on the basis of consolidated data.’

the sum of the own funds eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on the basis of consolidated data, and the contribution to the group eligible own funds of related undertakings referred to in Article 228(1), where that contribution is calculated in accordance with Article 228(2) or (4);
(b)

For the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, holdings in related undertakings as referred to in Article 228(1) shall not be included in the consolidated data.
Title I, Chapter VI, Section 3, Subsections 1, 2 and 3 and Title I, Chapter VI, Section 4, Subsections 1, 2 and 3 shall apply for the calculation of the own funds eligible for the Solvency Capital Requirement and of the Solvency Capital Requirement at group level based on consolidated data.’

Report as regards sustainability risk
1.   EIOPA, after consulting the ESRB, shall assess, on the basis of available data and the findings of the Platform on Sustainable Finance referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*16), and EBA in the context of its work under the mandate set out in Article 501c(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, whether a dedicated prudential treatment of exposures related to assets or activities associated substantially with environmental or social objectives would be justified. In particular, EIOPA shall assess the potential effects of a dedicated prudential treatment of exposures related to assets and activities which are associated substantially with environmental or social objectives or which are associated substantially with harm to such objectives on the protection of policy holders and financial stability in the Union, including fossil fuel related assets.
EIOPA shall submit a report on its findings to the Commission by 1 March 2025. Where appropriate, the report shall consider a possible risk-based prudential treatment of exposures related to assets and activities which are associated substantially with environmental or social objectives or which are associated substantially with harm to such objectives. The report shall be accompanied by an assessment of the impact of that possible risk-based prudential treatment of such exposures on insurance and reinsurance undertakings.
2.   EIOPA shall review at least every five years, with respect to natural catastrophe risk, the scope and the calibration of the standard parameters of the non-life catastrophe risk sub-module of the Solvency Capital Requirement referred to in Article 105(2), third subparagraph, point (b). For the purposes of those reviews, EIOPA shall take into account the latest available relevant evidence on climate science and the relevance of risks in terms of the risks underwritten by insurance and reinsurance undertakings that use the standard formula for the calculation of the non-life catastrophe risk sub-module of the Solvency Capital Requirement.
The first review pursuant to the first subparagraph shall be completed by 29 January 2027.
Where EIOPA finds, during a review pursuant to the first subparagraph, that, due to the scope or the calibration of the standard parameters of the non-life catastrophe risk sub-module, there is a significant discrepancy between the part of the Solvency Capital Requirement relating to natural catastrophes and the actual natural catastrophe risk that insurance and reinsurance undertakings face, EIOPA shall submit an opinion on natural catastrophe risk to the Commission.
An opinion on natural catastrophe risk submitted to the Commission pursuant to the third subparagraph shall consider the scope or the calibration of the standard parameters of the non-life catastrophe risk sub-module of the Solvency Capital Requirement in order to remedy the discrepancy found and be accompanied by an assessment of the impact of the proposed amendments on insurance and reinsurance undertakings.
3.   EIOPA shall evaluate whether and to what extent insurance and reinsurance undertakings assess their material exposure to risk related to biodiversity loss as part of the assessment referred to in Article 45(1). EIOPA shall subsequently assess which actions are to be taken to ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings duly consider those risks. EIOPA shall submit a report with its findings to the Commission by 30 June 2025.
EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall, through the Joint Committee referred to in Article 54 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010, develop guidelines to ensure that consistency, long-term considerations and common standards for assessment methodologies are integrated into the stress testing of environmental, social and governance risks. The Joint Committee shall publish those guidelines by 10 January 2026. EBA, EIOPA and ESMA shall, through that Joint Committee, explore how social and governance-related risks can be integrated into stress testing.
Article 304d
Review as regards separation of life and non-life activities and capital buffers
1.   EIOPA shall assess whether the requirement on the separation of life and non-life insurance business referred to in Article 73(1) is still justified. In particular, EIOPA shall assess the effects of maintaining, and the potential effects of lifting, the composite ban at least with respect to policy holder protection, potential cross-subsidisation between life and non-life activities, market efficiency and competitiveness. For the purposes of the assessment, EIOPA shall take into account the supervisory experiences with composite undertakings. EIOPA shall submit a report with its findings to the Commission by 31 January 2028.
2.   EIOPA shall monitor until 31 January 2032 the contribution to group Solvency Capital Requirements referred to in Article 228(3), point (a)(ii), of this Directive of the combined buffer requirement of related credit institutions, as defined in Article 128, point (6), of Directive No 2013/36/EU. For that purpose, EIOPA shall liaise with EBA and report to the Commission on any findings.
Article 304e
Extension of deadlines in exceptional circumstances
1.   In the event of an exceptional health emergency, natural catastrophe or other extreme event, EIOPA, on its own initiative or upon request from one or more supervisory authorities or from the Commission, shall assess whether such an exceptional health emergency, natural catastrophe or other extreme event is such as to affect materially the operational capabilities of insurance and reinsurance undertakings, preventing them from submitting information within the deadlines set out in Article 35b(1), (2) and (3), Article 51(7), Article 254(3), Article 256(1) and Article 256b(1). When carrying out that assessment, EIOPA shall cooperate closely with the relevant supervisory authorities to determine the impact of the extreme event on the ability to submit information within the deadlines set out in those provisions.
EIOPA shall submit its assessment to the Commission without undue delay and no later than one week after receipt of the request referred to in the first subparagraph.
Where EIOPA considers that an exceptional health emergency, natural catastrophe or other extreme event affects materially the operational capabilities of insurance and reinsurance undertakings preventing them from meeting the deadlines set out in Article 35b(1), (2) and (3), Article 51(7), Article 254(3), Article 256(1) and Article 256b(1), EIOPA, as well as the relevant supervisory authorities, shall publish that information on their respective websites.
The Commission may extend those deadlines by means of a delegated act adopted in accordance with this Article.
2.   In order to ensure a level playing field in relation to the application of paragraph 1, the Commission may supplement this Directive by adopting delegated acts in accordance with Article 301a for individual extreme events which:
(a)
define the scope of application of deadlines extension taking into account the insurance and reinsurance undertakings affected by the event;
(b)
set out exceptional extended deadlines for reporting, which may be up to 10 weeks longer than those provided in Article 35b(1), (2) and (3), Article 51(7), Article 254(3), Article 256(1) and Article 256b(1); and
(c)
specify which information referred to in Article 35b(1), (2) and (3), Article 51(7), Article 254(3), Article 256(1) and Article 256b(1) is to be reported under such extended deadlines.
Where EIOPA has not submitted an assessment in accordance with paragraph 1, the Commission shall seek the views of EIOPA, as appropriate, before adopting a delegated act in accordance with this Article.
