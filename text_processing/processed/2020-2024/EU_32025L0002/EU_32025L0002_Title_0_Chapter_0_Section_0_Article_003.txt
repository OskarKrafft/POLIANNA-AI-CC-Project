Article 3
Amendment to Directive 2002/87/EC
In Article 31 of Directive 2002/87/EC, the following paragraph is added:
‘3.   By 31 December 2027, the Commission shall in a report to the European Parliament and the Council assess the functioning of this Directive and Directive 2009/138/EC on the aspects listed below, in particular taking into account the prudential treatment of cross-sectoral participation ownerships under sectoral rules, in terms of a level playing field:
(a)
whether the fact that there are financial services undertakings that are subject to financial supervision under sectoral rules, but are not listed in any of the financial sectors identified in this Directive, creates an uneven playing field among financial conglomerates;
(b)
whether all financial conglomerates implement rules governing capital adequacy requirements, including those set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 342/2014 (*18), in a consistent manner, and whether those rules impose comparable overall quantitative requirements to financial conglomerates, irrespective of whether the main financial sector of the financial conglomerate is the banking sector, the insurance sector or the investment services sector;
(c)
whether the supervisory review processes, and the allocation of mandates and enforcement powers between coordinators and sectoral supervisors, in particular as regards capital adequacy requirements, are sufficiently clear and harmonised to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are effectively enforced in a consistent manner throughout the Union, irrespective of the main financial sector in which a financial conglomerate operates;
(d)
whether the absence of identification of an undertaking that is ultimately responsible for complying with this Directive poses issues with regard to ensuring a level playing field.
