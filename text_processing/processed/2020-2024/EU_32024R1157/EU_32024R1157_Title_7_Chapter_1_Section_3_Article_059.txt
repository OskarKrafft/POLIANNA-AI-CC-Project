Article 59
Environmentally sound management
1.   The waste producer, the notifier, the person who arranges the shipment and any other undertaking involved in a shipment of waste or its recovery or disposal shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the waste is managed without endangering human health and in an environmentally sound manner throughout the duration of the shipment and during the recovery and disposal of the waste.
2.   For the purposes of export of waste, the waste shall be deemed to be managed in an environmentally sound manner as regards recovery or disposal, if it can be demonstrated that the waste, as well as any residual waste generated through recovery or disposal, will be managed in accordance with human health, climate and environmental protection requirements that are considered equivalent to human health and environmental protection requirements under Union legislation. When assessing such equivalence, full compliance with requirements stemming from Union legislation shall not be required, but it shall be demonstrated that the requirements applied in the country of destination ensure a similar level of protection of human health and the environment than the requirements stemming from Union legislation. In order to perform the equivalence assessment, the relevant provisions of Union legislation and the international guidance referred to in Annex IX shall be used as points of reference.
