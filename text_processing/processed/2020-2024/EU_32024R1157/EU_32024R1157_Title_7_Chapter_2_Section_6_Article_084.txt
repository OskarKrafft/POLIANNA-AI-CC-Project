Article 84
Review
By 31 December 2035, the Commission shall, taking into account, inter alia, the reports drawn up in accordance with Article 73, and the review referred to in Article 62(5), carry out a review of this Regulation and submit a report on the results thereof to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, if the Commission deems it appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
The Commission shall, during its review and as a part of its report, assess in particular:
(a)
the efficiency of the procedure of prior written notification and consent laid down in Chapter 1 of Title II, and notably the related timelines in Articles 8, 14, 15 and 16, inter alia, by analysing elements such as the number of objections and consents, and the time between the submission of and a decision taken on a notification. The Commission may use data stored in the systems referred to in Article 27 for this purpose;
(b)
if publishing data on the shipments of waste in accordance with Article 21 provides adequate transparency, in particular by analysing if and why names of the facilities at destination were considered as confidential due to Union and national legislation by competent authorities or persons who arrange the shipments;
(c)
if this Regulation sufficiently contributed to climate neutrality, achieving a circular economy and zero pollution, taking into account the reports and data published by relevant Union’s agencies.
The Commission shall, during its review and as a part of its report, assess in addition whether the principle of equality in Union law has been respected, evaluate in this context possible impacts on any Member State’s competitiveness, and take rectifying measures where deemed necessary.
