Article 45
Monitoring of export and safeguard procedure
1.   The Commission shall monitor the exports of waste from the Union to countries to which the OECD Decision applies, with a view to ensuring that such exports do not lead to significant environmental or human health damage in the country of destination or that waste imported from the Union is not shipped onwards to third countries. As part of its monitoring, the Commission shall assess requests from natural or legal persons which are accompanied by relevant information and data showing that management of waste exported from the Union does not fulfil the requirements of environmentally sound management as referred to in Article 59 in a third country to which the OECD Decision applies, or that such exports cause substantial adverse effects on the management of waste generated in that country.
2.   In cases where:
(a)
there is insufficient evidence available demonstrating that a country to which the OECD Decision applies has the ability to recover certain waste in an environmentally sound manner as referred to in Article 59, including due to the export of such waste from the Union to the country concerned; or
(b)
where there is evidence that the country concerned fails to meet the requirements of Article 59 for this waste; or
(c)
there is evidence that there are substantial adverse effects on the management of waste generated in that country due to the export of waste from the Union,
the Commission shall request the competent authorities of the country concerned to provide, within 60 days, information on the conditions under which the waste in question is recovered, the effect of the export of the waste from the Union on the management of the waste generated in that country and the ability of the country concerned to manage this waste in an environmentally sound manner as referred to in Article 59. The Commission may grant an extension of this time limit if the country concerned makes a reasoned request for an extension thereof.
3.   The request referred to in paragraph 2 shall aim to verify that the country concerned has:
(a)
put in place and implemented an adequate legal framework for the import and management of the waste concerned, both imported waste and waste generated in the country, in an environmentally sound manner, as well as adequate measures to ensure the environmentally sound management of the residual waste generated through the recovery of the waste concerned;
(b)
put in place separate reporting on the quantity of waste generated in the country concerned and of waste imported into that country;
(c)
sufficient capacity in its territory allowing the waste concerned to be managed in an environmentally sound manner, taking into consideration the volume of waste imported into its territory;
(d)
put in place an adequate strategy, including measures to ensure that the import of the waste concerned has no substantial adverse effect on the collection and management of the waste generated domestically;
(e)
put in place and implemented adequate enforcement measures to ensure that the waste concerned is managed in an environmentally sound manner and address possible illegal shipments or treatment of such waste;
(f)
in the case of the export of plastic waste, been implementing requirements designed to ensure that plastic waste will be recycled in an environmentally sound manner and that residual waste generated through the recycling process will be managed in an environmentally sound manner, including through a prohibition of open burning or dumping of such waste. The request shall in addition aim to verify that measures are implemented to avoid the import of plastic waste from the Union undermining the environmentally sound management of plastic waste generated domestically and also that measures have been taken to prevent the shipment of imported plastic waste to other countries. Information shall also be provided showing that specific enforcement and inspections of shipments of plastic waste and facilities managing such waste are carried out at regular intervals to implement those requirements and mitigate pollution to air, soil, water or the marine environment linked to the mismanagement of plastic waste.
4.   For the purpose of the verifications referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission shall, where relevant, consult relevant stakeholders.
5.   The Commission shall exercise specific scrutiny with regard to exports of plastic waste to countries to which the OECD Decision applies. The Commission shall by 21 May 2026 assess whether countries to which the OECD Decision applies and which import significant volumes of plastic waste from the Union comply with this Article.
6.   Where, further to the request referred to in paragraph 2, the country concerned does not provide sufficient evidence as referred to in paragraph 3 that the waste concerned is managed in an environmentally sound manner in accordance with Article 59, or that there are no substantial adverse effects on the management of waste generated in that country as a consequence of the waste exported from the Union, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 80 to supplement this Regulation by prohibiting the export of the waste concerned to this country.
A prohibition shall only be lifted by the Commission where it has sufficient evidence that the waste concerned will be managed in an environmentally sound manner and that there are no substantial adverse effects on the management of waste generated in that country as a consequence of the waste exported from the Union.
