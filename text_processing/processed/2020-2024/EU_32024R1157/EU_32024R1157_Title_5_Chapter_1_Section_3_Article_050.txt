1.   Imports into the Union of waste destined for disposal shall be prohibited except imports coming from:
(a)
countries which are Parties to the Basel Convention;
(b)
other countries with which the Union, or the Union and its Member States, have concluded bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements compatible with Union legislation and in accordance with Article 11 of the Basel Convention;
(c)
other countries with which individual Member States have concluded bilateral agreements or arrangements in accordance with paragraph 2; or
(d)
other areas in cases where, on exceptional grounds during situations of crisis, peacemaking or peacekeeping operations, or war, no bilateral agreements or arrangements pursuant to point (b) or (c) can be concluded or where a competent authority in the country of dispatch has either not been designated or is unable to act.
2.   In exceptional cases, Member States may conclude bilateral agreements and arrangements for the disposal of specific waste in those Member States, where such waste will not be managed in an environmentally sound manner in the country of dispatch.
These agreements and arrangements shall:
(a)
be compatible with Union law and in accordance with Article 11 of the Basel Convention;
(b)
guarantee that the disposal operations will be carried out in an authorised facility and will comply with the requirements for environmentally sound management as referred to in Article 59(1) of this Regulation, Article 13 of Directive 2008/98/EC and other Union law on waste, in particular the Union legislation referred to in Annex IX, Part 1;
(c)
guarantee that the waste is produced in the country of dispatch and that its disposal will be carried out exclusively in the Member State which has concluded the agreement or arrangement; and
(d)
be notified to the Commission prior to their conclusion or, in emergency situations, at the latest up to one month after conclusion.
3.   Bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements referred to in paragraph 1, points (b) and (c), shall be based on the procedural requirements of Article 51.
4.   The countries referred to in paragraph 1, points (a), (b) and (c), shall be required to present a prior duly reasoned request to the competent authority of the Member State of destination on the basis that they do not have and cannot reasonably acquire the technical capacity and the necessary facilities in order to dispose of the waste in an environmentally sound manner as referred to in Article 59.
