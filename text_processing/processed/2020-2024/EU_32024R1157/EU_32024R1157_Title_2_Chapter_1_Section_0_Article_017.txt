Article 17
Changes after consent
1.   If any essential change is made to the details or conditions of the consent, the notifier shall inform the competent authorities concerned and the consignee immediately and, where possible, before a shipment starts. Essential changes shall be deemed to be, inter alia, changes compared to those indicated in the notification in the quantity of waste, in the routing, including possible alternative routings, the date or dates of shipment or the carrier or carriers, or changes to the duration of the shipment, due to unforeseen circumstances occurring after the start of the shipment, leading to a shipment exceeding its period of validity.
2.   In the case of an essential change as referred to in paragraph 1, a new notification shall be submitted, unless all the competent authorities concerned consider that no new notification is required and inform the notifier thereof. The competent authorities shall inform the notifier as soon as possible but no later than five working days after receipt of the information pursuant to paragraph 1. A planned shipment shall not take place until the notifier has been informed by the competent authorities concerned. Where a shipment has already started, the notifier shall ensure that the consignment is halted as soon as practicable until the notifier is informed by the competent authorities concerned whether a new notification is required.
3.   Where essential changes referred to in paragraph 1 involve competent authorities other than those concerned in the original notification, a new notification shall be submitted.
