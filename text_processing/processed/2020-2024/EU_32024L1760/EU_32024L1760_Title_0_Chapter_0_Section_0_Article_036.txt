Article 36
Review and reporting
1.   The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the necessity of laying down additional sustainability due diligence requirements tailored to regulated financial undertakings with respect to the provision of financial services and investment activities, and the options for such due diligence requirements as well as their impacts, in line with the objectives of this Directive.
The report shall take into account other Union legislative acts that apply to regulated financial undertakings. It shall be published at the earliest possible opportunity after 25 July 2024, but no later than 26 July 2026. It shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
2.   By 26 July 2030, and every three years thereafter, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Directive and its effectiveness in reaching its objectives, in particular in addressing adverse impacts. The report shall be accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal. The first report shall, inter alia, assess the following issues:
(a)
the impacts of this Directive on SMEs, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of the different measures and tools for support provided to SMEs by the Commission and the Member States;
(b)
the scope of this Directive in terms of the companies covered, whether it ensures the effectiveness of this Directive in light of its objectives, a level playing field between entities covered and that companies cannot circumvent the application of this Directive, including:
—
whether Article 3(1), point (a), needs to be revised so that entities constituted as different legal forms from those listed in Annex I or Annex II to Directive 2013/34/EU are covered by this Directive;
—
whether business models or forms of economic cooperation with third-party companies other than those covered by Article 2 need to be included in the scope of this Directive;
—
whether the thresholds regarding the number of employees and net turnover laid down in Article 2 need to be revised and if a sector-specific approach needs to be introduced in high-risk sectors;
—
whether the criterion of net turnover generated in the Union laid down in Article 2(2) needs to be revised;
(c)
whether the definition of the term ‘chain of activities’ needs to be revised;
(d)
whether the Annex to this Directive needs to be modified, including in light of international developments, and whether it should be extended to cover additional adverse impacts, in particular adverse impacts on good governance;
(e)
whether the rules on combatting climate change provided for in this Directive, especially as regards the design of transition plans for climate change mitigation, their adoption and the putting into effect of those plans by companies, as well as the powers of supervisory authorities related to those rules, need to be revised;
(f)
the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanisms put in place at national level, of the penalties and the rules on civil liability;
(g)
whether changes to the level of harmonisation provided for in this Directive are required to ensure a level-playing field for companies in the internal market, including the convergence and divergence between provisions of national law transposing this Directive.
