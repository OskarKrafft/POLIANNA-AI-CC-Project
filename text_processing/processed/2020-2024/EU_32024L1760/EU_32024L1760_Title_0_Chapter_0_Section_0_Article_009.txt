Article 9
Prioritisation of identified actual and potential adverse impacts
1.   Member States shall ensure that, where it is not feasible to prevent, mitigate, bring to an end or minimise all identified adverse impacts at the same time and to their full extent, companies prioritise adverse impacts identified pursuant to Article 8 in order to fulfil the obligations laid down in Article 10 or 11.
2.   The prioritisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the severity and likelihood of the adverse impacts.
3.   Once the most severe and most likely adverse impacts are addressed in accordance with Article 10 or 11 within a reasonable time, the company shall address less severe and less likely adverse impacts.
