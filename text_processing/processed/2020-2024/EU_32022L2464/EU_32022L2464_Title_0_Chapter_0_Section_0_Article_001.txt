SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING STANDARDS

Article 29b
Sustainability reporting standards
1.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 49 supplementing this Directive to provide for sustainability reporting standards. Those sustainability reporting standards shall specify the information that undertakings are to report in accordance with Articles 19a and 29a and, where relevant, shall specify the structure to be used to present that information.
In the delegated acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph the Commission shall, by 30 June 2023, specify the information that undertakings are to report in accordance with Article 19a(1) and (2), and Article 29a(1) and (2) where appropriate, which shall at least include the information that financial market participants subject to the disclosure obligations of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 need in order to comply with those obligations.
In the delegated acts referred to in the first subparagraph the Commission shall, by 30 June 2024, specify:
(i)
complementary information that undertakings are to report with regard to the sustainability matters and reporting areas listed in Article 19a(2), where necessary;
(ii)
information that undertakings are to report that is specific to the sector in which they operate.
The reporting requirements laid down in the delegated acts referred to in the first subparagraph shall not enter into force earlier than four months after their adoption by the Commission.
When adopting delegated acts to specify the information required under point (ii) of the third subparagraph, the Commission shall pay particular attention to the scale of the risks and impacts related to sustainability matters for each sector, taking account of the fact that risks and impacts are higher for some sectors than for others.
The Commission shall, at least every three years after their date of application, review the delegated acts adopted pursuant to this Article, taking into consideration the technical advice of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), and, where necessary, it shall amend such delegated acts to take into account relevant developments, including developments with regard to international standards.
The Commission shall, at least once a year, consult the European Parliament, and consult jointly the Member State Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, referred to in Article 24 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, and the Accounting Regulatory Committee, referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, on EFRAG’s work programme as regards the development of sustainability reporting standards.
2.   The sustainability reporting standards shall ensure the quality of reported information, by requiring that it is understandable, relevant, verifiable, comparable and represented in a faithful manner. The sustainability reporting standards shall avoid imposing a disproportionate administrative burden on undertakings, including by taking account, to the greatest extent possible, of the work of global standard-setting initiatives for sustainability reporting as required by point (a) of paragraph 5.
The sustainability reporting standards shall, taking into account the subject matter of a particular sustainability reporting standard:
(a)
specify the information that undertakings are to disclose about the following environmental factors:
(i)
climate change mitigation, including as regards scope 1, scope 2 and, where relevant, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions;
(ii)
climate change adaptation;
(iii)
water and marine resources;
(iv)
resource use and the circular economy;

(c)
specify the information that undertakings are to disclose about the following governance factors:
(i)
the role of the undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory bodies with regard to sustainability matters, and their composition, as well as their expertise and skills in relation to fulfilling that role or the access such bodies have to such expertise and skills;
(ii)
the main features of the undertaking’s internal control and risk management systems, in relation to the sustainability reporting and decision-making process;
(iii)
business ethics and corporate culture, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery, the protection of whistleblowers and animal welfare;
(iv)
activities and commitments of the undertaking related to exerting its political influence, including its lobbying activities;
(v)
the management and quality of relationships with customers, suppliers and communities affected by the activities of the undertaking, including payment practices, especially with regard to late payment to small and medium-sized undertakings.
3.   The sustainability reporting standards shall specify the forward-looking, retrospective, qualitative and quantitative information, as appropriate, to be reported by undertakings.
4.   Sustainability reporting standards shall take account of the difficulties that undertakings may encounter in gathering information from actors throughout their value chain, especially from those which are not subject to the sustainability reporting requirements laid down in Article 19a or 29a and from suppliers in emerging markets and economies. Sustainability reporting standards shall specify disclosures on value chains that are proportionate and relevant to the capacities and the characteristics of undertakings in value chains, and to the scale and complexity of their activities, especially those of undertakings that are not subject to the sustainability reporting requirements in Article 19a or 29a. Sustainability reporting standards shall not specify disclosures that would require undertakings to obtain information from small and medium-sized undertakings in their value chain that exceeds the information to be disclosed pursuant to the sustainability reporting standards for small and medium-sized undertakings referred to in Article 29c.
The first subparagraph is without prejudice to Union requirements on undertakings to conduct a due diligence process.
5.   When adopting delegated acts pursuant to paragraph 1, the Commission shall, to the greatest extent possible, take account of:
(a)
the work of global standard-setting initiatives for sustainability reporting, and existing standards and frameworks for natural capital accounting and for greenhouse gas accounting, responsible business conduct, corporate social responsibility, and sustainable development;
