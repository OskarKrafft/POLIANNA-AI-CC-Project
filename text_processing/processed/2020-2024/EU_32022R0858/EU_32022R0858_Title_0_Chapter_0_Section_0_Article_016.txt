Article 16
Amendment to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014
In Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:

                  ‘If the Commission concludes that there is no need to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of Articles 35 and 36 in accordance with Article 52(12), a CCP or a trading venue may, before 22 June 2022, apply to its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The competent authority, taking into account the risks to the orderly functioning of the relevant CCP or trading venue resulting from the application of the access rights under Article 35 or 36 as regards exchange-traded derivatives, may decide that Article 35 or 36 does not apply to the relevant CCP or trading venue, respectively, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives, for a transitional period until 3 July 2023. Where the competent authority decides to approve such a transitional period, the CCP or trading venue shall not benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or 36 as regards exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of the transitional period. The competent authority shall notify ESMA and, in the case of a CCP, the college of competent authorities for that CCP, whenever it approves a transitional period.’.
