Article 7
Assessment of national measures
1.   By 30 September 2023, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall assess:
(a)
the consistency of national measures identified, on the basis of the integrated national energy and climate plans, national long-term strategies and the biennial progress reports submitted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, as relevant for the achievement of the climate-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) of this Regulation with that objective;
(b)
the consistency of relevant national measures with ensuring progress on adaptation as referred to in Article 5, taking into account the national adaptation strategies referred to in Article 5(4).
The Commission shall submit the conclusions of that assessment, together with the State of the Energy Union report prepared in the respective calendar year in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, to the European Parliament and to the Council.
2.   Where the Commission finds, after due consideration of the collective progress assessed in accordance with Article 6(1), that a Member State’s measures are inconsistent with the climate-neutrality objective set out in Article 2(1) or inconsistent with ensuring progress on adaptation as referred to in Article 5, it may issue recommendations to that Member State. The Commission shall make such recommendations publicly available.
3.   Where recommendations are issued in accordance with paragraph 2, the following principles shall apply:
(a)
the Member State concerned shall, within six months of receipt of the recommendations, notify the Commission on how it intends to take due account of the recommendations in a spirit of solidarity between Member States and the Union and between Member States;
(b)
after the submission of the notification referred to in point (a) of this paragraph, the Member State concerned shall set out, in its following integrated national energy and climate progress report submitted in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, in the year following the year in which the recommendations were issued, how it has taken due account of the recommendations; if the Member State concerned decides not to address the recommendations or a substantial part thereof, that Member State shall provide the Commission its reasoning;
(c)
the recommendations shall be complementary to the latest country-specific recommendations issued in the context of the European Semester.
