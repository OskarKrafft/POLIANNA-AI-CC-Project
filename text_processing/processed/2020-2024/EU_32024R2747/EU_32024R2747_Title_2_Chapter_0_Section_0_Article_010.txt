Article 10
Voluntary crisis protocols
1.   The Board may recommend the Commission to initiate the drawing up of voluntary crisis protocols by economic operators for addressing crises under the internal market emergency mode.
2.   The Commission shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of those voluntary crisis protocols by economic operators. Economic operators may decide, on a voluntary basis, whether to participate in voluntary crisis protocols.
3.   The voluntary crisis protocols shall set out:
(a)
the specific parameters of the disruption that the voluntary crisis protocol seeks to address and the objectives it pursues;
(b)
the role of each participant under the voluntary crisis protocol and the preparatory measures they are to put in place once the internal market emergency mode has been activated to mitigate and respond to the crisis;
(c)
a clear procedure for determining the moment of the activation and the period during which the measures are to be taken once the crisis protocol has been activated;
(d)
actions to mitigate and respond to potential crises under the internal market emergency mode, strictly limited to what is necessary for addressing them.
4.   The Commission shall, as appropriate, involve authorities of the Member States, and Union bodies, offices and agencies in drawing up the voluntary crisis protocols. The Commission may, where necessary and appropriate, also involve civil society organisations or other relevant organisations.
