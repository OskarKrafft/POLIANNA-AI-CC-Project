Article 35
Measures to ensure the availability and supply of crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services
1.   Where the Commission is informed, pursuant to Article 34(1), that there is a risk that crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services are insufficient in a Member State to meet the needs related to the internal market emergency, it may, taking into consideration the opinion of the Board, recommend Member States to take specific measures. Those measures shall, as quickly as possible, ensure the efficient re-organisation of supply chains and production lines and the use of existing stocks to increase the availability and supply of such goods or services.

(a)
facilitating the expansion or repurposing of existing or the establishment of new production capacities for crisis-relevant goods;
(b)
facilitating the expansion of existing or the establishment of new capacities related to service activities;
(c)
aiming to accelerate relevant approval and authorisation procedures, including environmental permits, regarding or affecting the production and distribution of crisis-relevant goods;
(d)
aiming to accelerate authorisation and registration procedures for crisis-relevant services;
(e)
