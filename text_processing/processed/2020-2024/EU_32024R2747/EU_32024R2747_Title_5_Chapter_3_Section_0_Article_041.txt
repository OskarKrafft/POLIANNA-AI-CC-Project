Article 41
Exclusivity clause
1.   During an internal market emergency mode, the agreement governing the Commission’s procurement on behalf of or in the name of one or more participating Member States or the joint procurement between the Commission and one or more participating Member States shall, where appropriate, provide for an exclusivity clause, under which participating Member States commit to not procuring the crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services in question through other channels and to not running parallel negotiations.
Where an exclusivity clause is provided for, it shall stipulate that the participating Member States are allowed to launch their own procurement procedure for the acquisition of additional quantities of crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services that are subject to the ongoing joint procurement or procurement by the Commission on behalf of or in the name of the Member States in a manner that does not undermine the ongoing procurement, subject to the agreement of the Commission and after consulting all other participating Member States. The request for such an agreement shall be addressed to the Commission, who shall forward it to the other participating Member States for their consideration.
2.   The exclusivity clause shall apply in relation to any new contracts, including specific contracts in framework contracts, that the contracting authorities or contracting entities of the participating Member States would consider concluding during the activation of the internal market emergency mode.
