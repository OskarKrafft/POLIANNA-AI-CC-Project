Article 34
Solidarity and coordinated distribution of crisis-relevant goods and services
1.   In the event of a shortage of crisis-relevant goods and services affecting one or more Member States, the Member States concerned may notify the Commission thereof and indicate the quantities needed and any other relevant information. The Commission shall transmit the information to the relevant competent authorities and streamline the coordination of Member States’ responses.
2.   In the event that the Commission, pursuant to paragraph 1, is informed that crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services are insufficient in a Member State to meet the needs related to the internal market emergency, the Commission may, taking into consideration the opinion provided by the Board and the information collected under this Regulation, recommend to other Member States to distribute those goods or services in a targeted way, where possible, having regard to the need to prevent further disruptions to the internal market, including in geographical areas particularly affected by such disruptions and in accordance with the principles of necessity, proportionality and solidarity, by establishing the most efficient use of those goods or services with a view to ending the internal market emergency.
