Article 18
Activation
1.   The internal market emergency mode shall only be activated if the criteria laid down in Article 17(1) are fulfilled.
2.   The internal market emergency mode may be activated without the internal market vigilance mode having previously been activated with regard to the same goods or services.
The activation of the internal market emergency mode regarding certain goods and services does not prevent the activation or continued application of the internal market vigilance mode or deployment of the vigilance measures laid down in Article 16 regarding the same goods and services. Where the internal market vigilance mode has previously been activated, the internal market emergency mode may replace it partially or entirely.

4.   The Council may activate the internal market emergency mode and, where applicable, adopt a list of crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services, or of both, by means of a Council implementing act on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. The duration of the activation shall be specified in the implementing act, and shall be a maximum of six months. The list of crisis-relevant goods and services may be amended by means of Council implementing act on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
