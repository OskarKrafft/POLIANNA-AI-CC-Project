Article 15
Extension and deactivation
1.   In the event that the Commission considers that the reasons for activating the internal market vigilance mode pursuant to Article 14(1) remain valid, and taking into consideration the opinion provided by the Board, it shall propose to the Council that it extends the internal market vigilance mode. Subject to urgent and exceptional changes in circumstances, the Commission shall make best efforts to do so no later than 30 days before the expiry of the period for which the internal market vigilance mode has been activated. On the basis of that proposal, the Council may extend the internal market vigilance mode by no more than six months at a time by means of a Council implementing act.
2.   Where the Commission, taking into consideration the opinion provided by the Board, finds that the conditions referred to in Article 3, point (2), are no longer fulfilled with respect to some or all vigilance measures or for some or all of the goods and services of critical importance, it shall propose to the Council to deactivate the internal market vigilance mode in full or in part. On the basis of that proposal, the Council may deactivate the internal market vigilance mode by means of a Council implementing act.
