Article 19
Extension and deactivation
1.   In the event that the Commission considers that the reasons for activating the internal market emergency mode pursuant to Article 17(1) remain valid, and taking into consideration the opinion provided by the Board, it shall propose to the Council that it extends the internal market emergency mode. Subject to urgent and exceptional changes in circumstances, the Commission shall make best efforts to do so no later than 30 days before the expiry of the period for which the internal market emergency mode has been activated. On the basis of that proposal, the Council may extend the internal market emergency mode by no more than six months at a time by means of a Council implementing act.
2.   Where the Board has concrete and reliable evidence that the internal market emergency mode should be deactivated, it may formulate an opinion to that effect and transmit it to the Commission. Where the Commission, taking into consideration the opinion provided by the Board, considers that the internal market emergency no longer exists, it shall propose to the Council, without delay, the deactivation of the internal market emergency mode.
3.   The measures taken in accordance with Articles 27 to 35 shall cease to apply upon deactivation of the internal market emergency mode.
