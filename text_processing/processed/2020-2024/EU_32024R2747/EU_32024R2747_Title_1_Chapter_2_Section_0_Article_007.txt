Article 7
Emergency and resilience platform
1.   The Commission shall establish a stakeholder platform in order to facilitate sector-specific dialogue and partnerships by bringing together key stakeholders, namely representatives of economic operators, social partners, researchers and civil society. In particular, that platform shall provide a functionality that allows interested stakeholders to:
(a)
indicate voluntary actions needed to successfully respond to an internal market emergency;
(b)
provide scientific advice, opinions or reports on crisis-related issues;
(c)
contribute to the exchange of information and best practices, in particular as regards the free movement of goods, services and persons, and to the avoidance of divergent national measures which could create cross-border restrictions.
2.   The Commission and the Board shall take into account the outcomes of the sector-specific dialogue and partnerships referred to in paragraph 1, as well as any relevant input provided by stakeholders in accordance with that paragraph, in the implementation of this Regulation.
