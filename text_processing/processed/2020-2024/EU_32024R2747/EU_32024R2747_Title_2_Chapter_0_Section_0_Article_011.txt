That programme may include, in particular, the following:
(a)
monitoring, analysing and evaluating all relevant actions to facilitate the free movement of goods, services and persons;
(b)
promoting the implementation of best practices at Union and national level, and, where appropriate, best practices developed by countries outside the Union and international organisations;

developing guidance on knowledge dissemination and the implementation of different tasks at national and, where relevant, regional and local level;
(d)
encouraging the use of relevant new technologies and digital tools for the purpose of responding to internal market emergencies.
3.   The Commission shall develop and make available training programmes and materials for stakeholders, including economic operators. Where relevant, the Commission may invite stakeholders to participate in training and simulations.
4.   At the request of a Member State, the Commission may provide advice and support on crisis-preparedness and crisis-response measures, taking particular account of the needs and interests of that Member State.
