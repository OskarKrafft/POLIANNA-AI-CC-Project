7.   From 1 January 2035, the use of SF6 for the maintenance or servicing of electrical switchgear equipment shall be prohibited unless it is reclaimed or recycled, except if it is proved that reclaimed or recycled SF6:
(a)
cannot be used on technical grounds; or
(b)
are not available in the event of an emergency repair situation.
In such cases, the user shall provide evidence, upon request, setting out the justification for use to the competent authority of the Member State concerned or to the Commission.
This paragraph shall not apply to military equipment.
8.   The use of desflurane as an inhalation anaesthetic shall be prohibited from 1 January 2026, except where such use is strictly required and no other anaesthetic can be used on medical grounds. The healthcare institution shall keep evidence of the medical justification, and provide it, upon request, to the competent authority of the Member State concerned or to the Commission.
9.   The putting into operation of the following electrical switchgear using, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases in insulating or breaking medium shall be prohibited as follows:

14.   Paragraph 9 shall not apply where the operator can provide evidence that the order for the electrical switchgear has been placed before 11 March 2024.
15.   Paragraph 9 shall not apply where the devices to extend existing electrical switchgear that use fluorinated greenhouse gases with a lower global warming potential than the fluorinated greenhouse gases used in the existing electrical switchgear are not compatible with the existing electrical switchgear, and the use of those devices would require the replacement of the existing entire electrical switchgear.
16.   Where a derogation listed in paragraph 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 applies, the operator shall keep documentation establishing the evidence for the derogation for at least 5 years and shall make it available, upon request, to the competent authority of the Member State concerned or to the Commission.
17.   The operator shall notify the competent authority in the Member State where the electrical switchgear is put into operation when applying a derogation listed in paragraph 11, 12, 14 or 15.
18.   Parts of equipment may be installed for repair or servicing of existing electrical switchgear provided that there is no change of the type of fluorinated greenhouse gas used that leads to an increase of the global warming potential of the fluorinated greenhouse gas used or an increase in the amount of fluorinated greenhouse gases contained in the equipment.
19.   The putting into operation of any equipment or utilisation of any product listed in points 2(b), 4, 5(c), 7(b), (c) and (d), 8(b) to (e), 9(b) to (f), 11(c), 17(c) and 19(b) of Annex IV after the respective prohibition date specified in those points shall be prohibited unless the operator can provide evidence that:
(a)
the relevant safety requirements at the particular location do not permit the installation of equipment using fluorinated greenhouse gases below the global warming potential value specified in the respective prohibitions; or
(b)
the equipment was placed on the market before the relevant prohibition date set out in Annex IV.
20.   The operator shall keep documentation establishing the evidence referred to in paragraph 19 for at least 5 years and shall make it available, upon request, to the competent authority of the Member State concerned or to the Commission.
