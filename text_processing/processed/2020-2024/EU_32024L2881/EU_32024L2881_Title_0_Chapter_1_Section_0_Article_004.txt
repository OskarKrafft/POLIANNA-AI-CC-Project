(27)
‘air pollution hotspots’ means locations within a zone with the highest concentrations to which the population is likely to be directly or indirectly exposed for a period which is significant in relation to the averaging period of the limit values or target values, including where the pollution level is strongly influenced by the emissions from heavy pollution sources, such as nearby congested and heavily trafficked roads, a single industrial source or an industrial area with many sources, ports, airports, intensive residential heating, or a combination thereof;

‘average exposure indicator’ or ‘AEI’ means an average level determined on the basis of measurements at urban background locations throughout the average exposure territorial unit or, if there is no urban area located in that territorial unit, at rural background locations, and which reflects population exposure, used to check whether the average exposure reduction obligation and the average exposure concentration objective for that territorial unit have been met;
(34)

(44)
‘sensitive population and vulnerable groups’ means those population groups that are permanently or temporarily more sensitive or more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution than the average population, because of specific characteristics that make the health effects of exposure more significant or because they have a higher sensitivity or a lower threshold for health effects or have a reduced ability to protect themselves;
