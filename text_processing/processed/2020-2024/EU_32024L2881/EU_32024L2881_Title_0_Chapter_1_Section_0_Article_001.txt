Article 1
Objectives
1.   This Directive sets out air quality provisions with the aim of achieving a zero-pollution objective, so that air quality within the Union is progressively improved to levels no longer considered harmful to human health, natural ecosystems and biodiversity, as defined by the best available and most up-to-date scientific evidence, thus contributing to a toxic-free environment at the latest by 2050.
2.   This Directive lays down limit values, target values, average exposure reduction obligations, average exposure concentration objectives, critical levels, alert thresholds, information thresholds and long-term objectives. Such air quality standards, which are set out in Annex I, shall be regularly reviewed in accordance with Article 3, in line with WHO recommendations.
3.   Furthermore, this Directive contributes to achieving the Union’s pollution-reduction, biodiversity and ecosystem objectives in accordance with the 8th Environment Action Programme, as well as enhanced synergies between the Union’s air quality policy and other relevant Union policies.
