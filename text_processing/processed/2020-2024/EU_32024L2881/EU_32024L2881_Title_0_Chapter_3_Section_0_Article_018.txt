Article 18
Postponement of attainment deadline and exemption from the obligation to apply certain limit values
1.   Where, in a given zone, conformity with the limit values for particulate matter (PM10 and PM2,5), nitrogen dioxide, benzene or benzo(a)pyrene cannot be achieved by the deadline specified in Section 1, Table 1, of Annex I, Member States may postpone that deadline for that particular zone by a period justified by an air quality roadmap and provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of this Article are met:
(a)
up to 1 January 2040, if justified by site-specific dispersion characteristics, orographic boundary conditions, adverse climatic conditions, transboundary contributions, or where the necessary reductions can only be achieved by replacing a considerable fraction of the existing domestic heating systems that are the source of pollution causing exceedances; or
(b)
up to 1 January 2035, if justified by projections that demonstrate that even taking into account the expected impact of effective air pollution measures identified in the air quality roadmap, the limit values cannot be attained by the attainment deadline.
Where an attainment deadline has been postponed in accordance with the first subparagraph, point (b), of this paragraph, but attainment cannot be achieved by that postponed deadline, Member States may postpone the deadline for that particular zone for a second and last time by a period which is no longer than 2 years from the end of the first postponement period and which is justified by an updated air quality roadmap, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met.
2.   Member States may postpone an attainment deadline in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article if the following conditions are met:
(a)
an air quality roadmap is established by 31 December 2028 that meets the requirements listed in Article 19(6), (7) and (8) for the zone to which the postponement would apply;
(b)
the air quality roadmap referred to in point (a) of this paragraph is supplemented by information on air pollution abatement measures listed in Point B of Annex VIII and demonstrates how exceedance periods above the limit values will be kept as short as possible;
(c)
the air quality roadmap referred to in point (a) of this paragraph is underpinned by air quality projections, including those performed for the purposes of Point A, point 5 and point 7(e), of Annex VIII, which show how the limit values will be attained as soon as possible and no later than by the end of the postponed attainment deadline, taking into account reasonable and proportionate measures;
(d)
the air quality roadmap referred to in point (a) of this paragraph outlines how the public and, in particular, sensitive population and vulnerable groups will be informed in a coherent and easily understandable manner about the consequences of the postponement for human health and the environment;
(e)
the air quality roadmap referred to in point (a) of this paragraph outlines how additional funding, including via relevant national programmes, and Union funding programmes where applicable, will be mobilised to accelerate the improvement of air quality in the zone to which the postponement would apply;
(f)
the conditions laid down in paragraph 3 are fulfilled throughout the period of postponement of the attainment deadline;
(g)
where an attainment deadline is postponed in accordance with paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the updated air quality roadmap referred to in that subparagraph demonstrates that the first air quality roadmap has been implemented or that steps have been taken in view of its implementation and is supplemented by an analysis showing that the original projections of compliance made in accordance with point (c) of this paragraph did not materialise.
3.   During the period of postponement of an attainment deadline in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the Member State shall ensure that the following conditions are met:
(a)
the measures in the air quality roadmap referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, where applicable as updated in accordance with point (b) of this paragraph, are being implemented, as demonstrated by the Member State by way of an implementation report, including updated projections of emissions and, where possible, of concentrations provided to the Commission on a two-and-a-half yearly basis and for the first time by 30 June 2031; where relevant, reference may be made to the most recent programmes and projections of emissions reported pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/2284 and the accompanying informative inventory report and, where relevant, the implementation report may be integrated in the updated air quality roadmap;
(b)
the air quality roadmap referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is updated in accordance with Article 19(5);
(c)
from 1 January 2035, the concentration levels for the relevant pollutant show a general decreasing trend in line with an indicative trajectory towards compliance estimated in an updated air quality roadmap established pursuant to Point A, point 7(e), of Annex VIII;
(d)
the implementation reports and the updated air quality roadmaps are communicated to the Commission within 2 months of their adoption.
4.   Member States shall notify the Commission no later than 31 January 2029 where, in their view, paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (a) or (b), is applicable, and shall communicate the air quality roadmap referred to in paragraph 1 and all relevant information necessary for the Commission to assess whether the invoked reason for postponement and the conditions set out in that paragraph are satisfied.
Member States shall notify the Commission no later than 31 January 2034 where, in their view, attainment cannot be achieved by an attainment deadline postponed in accordance with paragraph 1, second subparagraph, and shall communicate the updated air quality roadmap referred to in paragraph 1 and all relevant information necessary for the Commission to assess whether the invoked reason for a second and last postponement and the conditions set out in that paragraph are satisfied.
As regards the projections provided as a reason for postponement, Member States shall justify the methods as well as the data used to obtain those projections.
In its assessment, the Commission shall take into account air quality projections provided by the Member State concerned, the estimated effects on ambient air quality in that Member State of measures that have been taken by that Member State as well as estimated effects on ambient air quality of Union measures.
Where the Commission has raised no objections within 9 months of receipt of that notification, the relevant conditions for the application of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be satisfied.
If objections are raised, the Commission may require the Member State concerned to adjust or provide a new air quality roadmap to meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1.
5.   By 31 December 2026, the Commission shall provide, by means of implementing acts, further technical details on the requirements for projections performed for the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article with the objective to show how the limit values specified in Section 1, Table 1, of Annex I will be attained, taking into account reasonable and proportionate measures. Furthermore, it shall specify information to be included in implementation reports for the purposes of paragraph 3 of this Article.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 26(2).
