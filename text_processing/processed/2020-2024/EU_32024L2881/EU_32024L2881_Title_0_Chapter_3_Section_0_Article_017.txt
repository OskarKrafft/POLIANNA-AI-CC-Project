Article 17
Exceedances attributable to winter-sanding or winter-salting of roads
1.   Member States may, for a given year, identify zones within which limit values for PM10 are exceeded in ambient air due to the re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or winter-salting of roads.
2.   Member States shall provide the Commission with lists of any such zones, as referred to in paragraph 1, together with information on concentrations and sources of PM10 in such zones.
Member States shall also provide the evidence demonstrating that any exceedances are due to re-suspended particulates and that reasonable measures have been taken to lower such concentrations.
3.   Without prejudice to Article 16, in the case of zones referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States need to establish the air quality plan provided for in Article 19 only in so far as exceedances are attributable to PM10 sources other than winter-sanding or winter-salting of roads.
4.   By 31 December 2026, the Commission shall provide, by means of implementing acts, technical details for the methodology for determining contributions from the re-suspension of particulates following winter-sanding or winter-salting of roads, as well as the information to be provided by Member States pursuant to paragraph 2, which shall include information on the contribution of re-suspension to daily concentration levels where applicable.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 26(2).
