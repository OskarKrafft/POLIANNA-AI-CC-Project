The EIT shall, on the basis of indicators and monitoring provisions set out, inter alia, in Regulation (EU) 2021/695 and in the SIA, and in close cooperation with the Commission, organise continuous monitoring and periodic external evaluations of the output, results and impact of each KIC, including the progress of the KICs towards financial sustainability, cost-efficiency and openness to new members.
The results of such monitoring and evaluations shall be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council and shall be made public.
