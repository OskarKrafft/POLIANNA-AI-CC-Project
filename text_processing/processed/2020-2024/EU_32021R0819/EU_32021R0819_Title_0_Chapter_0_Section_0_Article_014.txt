Article 14
Operational independence of the EIT and consistency with Union, Member State or intergovernmental action
1.   The EIT shall carry out its activities independently of national authorities and external pressures, while ensuring that such activities are consistent, through coordination, with other actions and instruments to be implemented at Union level, in particular in the fields of higher education, research and innovation.
2.   The EIT shall also seek synergies and complementarities by taking appropriate account of policies and initiatives at regional, national and intergovernmental levels in order to make use of best practices, well-established concepts and existing resources.
The Commission shall offer the EIT the necessary support in establishing appropriate synergies and complementarities with other activities undertaken under Regulation (EU) 2021/695, as well as other Union initiatives and programmes, while avoiding duplication.
The Commission shall provide recommendations to the EIT on how to reduce the administrative burden on KICs.
