3.   The minimum condition to form a KIC is the participation of at least three independent partner organisations, that are comprised of at least one HEI, one research organisation and one private company and that are established in at least three different Member States.
4.   In addition to the condition set out in paragraph 3, at least two thirds of the partner organisations forming a KIC shall be established in the Member States.
5.   The EIT shall adopt and publish criteria and procedures for financing, monitoring and evaluating the activities of the KICs prior to the launching of the selection procedure for new KICs. The EIT shall promptly inform the MSRG and the European Parliament of those criteria and procedures.
