1.   By 12 February 2028, the Commission shall review the state of technological development and environmental performance of biobased plastic packaging, taking into consideration the sustainability criteria laid down in Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (63).

(b)
lay down targets to increase the use of biobased feedstock in plastic packaging;
(c)
introduce the possibility to achieve the targets set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of this Regulation by using biobased plastic feedstock instead of recycled content recovered from post-consumer plastic waste in the event that suitable recycling technologies for food-contact packaging complying with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/1616 are not available;
(d)
amend, where appropriate, the definition of biobased plastic set out in Article 3(1), point (53).
