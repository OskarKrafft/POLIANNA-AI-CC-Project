Article 54
Rules on the calculation of the achievement of the recycling targets by including re-use
1.   A Member State may decide to achieve an adjusted level of the targets set out in Article 52(1) for a given year by taking into account the average share, in the preceding 3 years, of reusable sales packaging placed on the market for the first time and re-used within a re-use system.
The adjusted level shall be calculated by subtracting:
(a)
from the targets laid down in Article 52(1), points (a) and (c), the share of the reusable sales packaging referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in all sales packaging placed on the market; and
(b)
from the targets laid down in Article 52(1), points (b) and (d), the share of the reusable sales packaging referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, composed of the respective packaging material, in all sales packaging composed of that material placed on the market.
No more than five percentage points of the average share of reusable sales packaging shall be taken into account for the calculation of the adjusted target level.
2.   A Member State may take into account the quantity of wooden packaging that is repaired for re-use in the calculation of the targets laid down in Article 52(1), point (a), Article 52(1), point (b)(ii), Article 52(1), point (c), and Article 52(1), point (d)(ii).
