Article 34
Plastic carrier bags
1.   Member States shall take measures to achieve a sustained reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags on their territory.
A sustained reduction is considered to be achieved if the annual consumption does not exceed 40 lightweight plastic carrier bags per capita, or the equivalent target in weight, by 31 December 2025 and subsequently by 31 December each year thereafter.
2.   Measures to be taken by Member States to meet the target set out in paragraph 1 shall take into consideration the environmental impact of lightweight plastic carrier bags when they are manufactured, recycled or disposed of, and their composting properties, durability or specific intended use. Such measures may, by way of derogation from Article 4, include marketing restrictions, provided that they are proportionate and non-discriminatory.
3.   In addition to the measures under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, Member States may take measures, such as economic instruments and national reduction targets, as regards any kind of plastic carrier bags, regardless of their wall thickness, in accordance with the obligations arising from the TFEU.
4.   Member States may exclude from the obligations set out in paragraph 1 very lightweight plastic carrier bags which are required for hygiene purposes or provided as sales packaging for loose food to prevent food wastage.
5.   By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall prepare a report on packaging materials, other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, which are likely to have a more detrimental impact on the environment than lightweight plastic carrier bags and, where appropriate, present a legislative proposal setting out reduction targets and measures to achieve those targets.
