2.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, points (a) and (c), a Member State may postpone the deadlines set out in paragraph 1, points (b) and (d), by up to 5 years under the following conditions:
(a)
the derogation from the targets in the period of postponement is limited to a maximum of 15 percentage points from a single target or divided between two targets;
(b)
as a result of the derogation from the targets in the period of postponement, the recycling rate for a single target is not reduced below 30 %;
(c)
as a result of the derogation from the targets in the period of postponement, the recycling rate for a single target set out in paragraph 1, points (b)(v) and (vi), is not reduced below 60 %, and the recycling rate for a single target set out in paragraph 1, points (d)(v) and (vi), is not reduced below 70 %; and
(d)
at the latest 24 months before the respective deadline laid down in paragraph 1, points (b) and (d), of this Article, the Member State notifies the Commission of its intention to postpone the deadline and submits to the Commission an implementation plan in accordance with Annex XI to this Regulation, which may be combined with an implementation plan submitted pursuant to Article 11(3), point (b), of Directive 2008/98/EC.
3.   Where a Member State requests to postpone the deadline laid down in paragraph 1, point (d), of this Article the Commission may, within 3 months of receipt of the implementation plan submitted pursuant to paragraph 2, point (d), of this Article request the Member State to revise the plan if the Commission considers that the plan does not comply with the requirements set out in Annex XI. The Member State shall submit a revised implementation plan within 3 months of receipt of the Commission’s request. If the Commission considers that the revised implementation plan does not comply with the requirements set out in Annex XI and that it is unlikely that the Member State will be able to meet the targets within the period of postponement pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission shall reject the implementation plan and the Member State shall be obliged to comply with the targets within the deadlines set in paragraph 1, point (d), of this Article.
4.   By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall review the targets laid down in paragraph 1, points (c) and (d), with a view to increasing them or setting further targets. To that end, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, if the Commission finds it appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
5.   Member States shall, where appropriate, encourage the use of materials obtained from recycled packaging waste for the manufacturing of packaging and other products by:
(a)
improving market conditions for such materials;
(b)
reviewing existing rules that prevent the use of such materials.
6.   A Member State may, while observing the general rules laid down in the TFEU and acting in accordance with this Regulation, adopt provisions which go beyond the minimum targets set out in this Article.
