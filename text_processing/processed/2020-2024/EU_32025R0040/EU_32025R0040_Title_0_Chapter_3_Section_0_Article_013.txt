Article 13
Labelling of waste receptacles for the collection of packaging waste
1.   By 12 August 2028 or 30 months from the adoption of the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 2, whichever is the latest, Member States shall ensure that harmonised labels that enable the separate collection of each material specific fraction of packaging waste that is intended to be discarded in separate receptacles are affixed, printed or engraved visibly, legibly and indelibly on all waste receptacles for collection of packaging waste. A receptacle for packaging waste may bear more than one label. This obligation does not apply to receptacles subject to deposit and return systems.
2.   By 12 August 2026, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish harmonised labels and specifications for the labelling requirements and formats for the labelling of the receptacles referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. When developing those implementing acts, the Commission shall take into account the specificities of the collection systems established in the Member States as well as the specificities of composite packaging. The labelling for receptacles shall correspond to the labelling for packaging as referred to in Article 12(6) with the exception of labelling for packaging subject to deposit and return systems. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 65(2).
