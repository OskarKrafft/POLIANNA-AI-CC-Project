Article 68
Penalties
1.   By 12 February 2027, Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
2.   The penalties for failure to comply with Articles 24 to 29 shall include administrative fines. Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this paragraph may be applied in such a manner that the fining procedure is initiated by the relevant authority and that the fine is imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies are effective and have equivalent effect to the administrative fines referred to in this paragraph. In any event, the fines imposed shall also be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
3.   Member States shall, by 12 February 2027, notify the Commission of the rules and measures referred to in paragraph 1 and 2 and shall notify it, without delay, of any subsequent amendment affecting them.
