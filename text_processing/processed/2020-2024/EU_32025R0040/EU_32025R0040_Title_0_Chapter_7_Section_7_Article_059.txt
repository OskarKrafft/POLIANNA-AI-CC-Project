Article 59
Union safeguard procedure
1.   Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 58(5) and (6), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State pursuant to Article 58, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall, without delay, enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified.
That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 65(2).
2.   The Commission shall address the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 to all Member States and shall communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator without delay.
If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the non-compliant packaging is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly.
If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.
3.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the packaging is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 36 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
4.   Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the packaging is attributed to shortcomings in the common technical specifications referred to in Article 37, the Commission shall, without delay, amend or repeal the common technical specifications concerned.
