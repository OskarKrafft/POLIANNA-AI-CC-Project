Article 16
Financial support measures for inclusion
1.   The Commission shall, where relevant, ensure that financial support measures, including pre-financing, are put in place to facilitate the participation of people with fewer opportunities, in particular of those whose participation is impeded for financial reasons. The level of support shall be based on objective criteria.
2.   In order to improve access for people with fewer opportunities and ensure the smooth implementation of the Programme, the Commission shall, where necessary, adjust or authorise the national agencies to adjust the grants to support learning mobility under the Programme.
3.   The costs of measures to facilitate or support inclusion shall not justify the rejection of an application under the Programme.
