Article 6
Classification
1.   Products designated by geographical indications shall be classified in accordance with the Combined Nomenclature at two, four, six or, where a Member State so decides, eight-digit level. Where a geographical indication covers products of more than one category, each entry shall be specified. Product classification shall only be used for registration, statistical and record keeping purposes, in particular for customs authorities. That classification shall not be used to determine comparable products for the purposes of protection against direct and indirect commercial use as referred to in Article 26(1), point (a).
2.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, lay down the technical presentation of, and online access to, the classification referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 88(2).
