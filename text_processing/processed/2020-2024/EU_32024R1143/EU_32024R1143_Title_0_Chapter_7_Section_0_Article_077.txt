Article 77
Attestation of compliance with the product specification
1.   An operator whose product, following the verification of compliance referred to in Article 72, is found to comply with the product specification of a traditional speciality guaranteed protected in accordance with this Regulation shall, on request, and depending on the system applied in the Member State concerned, be entitled to either:
(a)
an attestation, which may be a certified copy, certifying compliance with the product specification; or
(b)
inclusion in a list of approved operators established by the competent authority, such as the list provided for in Article 72(4). The relevant extract of the list (‘listing’) shall be made available online to each approved operator.
2.   The attestation of compliance and the listing referred to in paragraph 1, points (a) and (b) respectively, shall be updated periodically, based on a risk assessment.
3.   An operator that is no longer accorded the attestation of compliance or that has been removed from the list shall not continue to display or use the attestation of compliance or the listing.
4.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, lay down detailed rules on the form and content of the attestation of compliance and listing, as well as on the circumstances under which, and the forms in which, they are to be made available by the operators or traders for control or in the course of business, including in the case of an equivalent attestation concerning products originating in third countries. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 88(2).
