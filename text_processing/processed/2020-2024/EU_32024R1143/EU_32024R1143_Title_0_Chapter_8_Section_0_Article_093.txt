Article 92
Transitional provisions for national geographical indications
1.   Protection of geographical indications for products which do not fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 but which fall within the scope of this Regulation, granted under national law, shall cease on 14 May 2025 if no application for registration is submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 13 of this Regulation.
2.   If an application for the registration of a geographical indication, as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, is submitted to the Commission before the date referred to in that paragraph, national protection of that geographical indication shall cease on the date the Commission decides on its registration in accordance with Article 21. Article 10 shall not apply to that application. In the event of rejection of the application for registration, national protection shall continue until all judicial remedies have been exhausted, if relevant. After the national protection has ceased, the Member State concerned shall, without delay, request the cancellation of the registration of the corresponding appellation of origin in the International Register of the International Bureau.
