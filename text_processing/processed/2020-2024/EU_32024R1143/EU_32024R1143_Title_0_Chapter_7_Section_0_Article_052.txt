Article 52
Objectives
1.   A scheme for traditional specialities guaranteed (TSGs) is established to safeguard traditional methods of production and recipes by helping:
(a)
producers of traditional products in marketing and communicating the value-adding attributes of their traditional recipes and products to consumers;
(b)
to generate added value by contributing to fair competition in the marketing chain, a fair income for producers and contributing to the achievement of rural development policy objectives.
2.   The registration and the protection of traditional specialities guaranteed are without prejudice to the obligation of producers to comply with other Union rules, in particular relating to the placing of products on the market, to the single common organisation of the markets, and to food labelling.
3.   Directive (EU) 2015/1535 shall not apply to the scheme for traditional specialities guaranteed laid down in this Regulation.
