Article 54
Product specification
1.   A product specification shall include at least:
(a)
the product name proposed for registration, in the appropriate language versions;
(b)
a description of the product including its main physical, chemical, microbiological or organoleptic characteristics;
(c)
a description of the production method that the producers must follow, including, where appropriate, the nature and characteristics of the raw materials or ingredients used, if relevant including the commercial designation of the species involved and its scientific name, and the method by which the product is prepared; and
(d)
the key elements establishing the product’s traditional character.
The product specification may also include labelling requirements.
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 87 supplementing this Regulation by laying down rules which limit the information contained in the product specification, where such a limitation is necessary to avoid excessively voluminous applications for registration.
3.   The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, lay down rules on the form of the product specification. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 88(2).
