Article 70
Union symbol, indication and abbreviation
1.   A Union symbol shall be established for products designated as traditional speciality guaranteed. The indication ‘traditional speciality guaranteed’, the abbreviation ‘TSG’, and the Union symbol referring to the traditional speciality guaranteed may only be used in connection with products produced in compliance with the relevant product specification. They may also be used for information and educational purposes, provided that such use is not likely to mislead the consumer. The indication ‘traditional speciality guaranteed’ or the corresponding abbreviation ‘TSG’ may appear in the labelling.
2.   In the case of products originating in the Union that are marketed as traditional speciality guaranteed registered in accordance with this Regulation, the Union symbol referred to in paragraph 2 shall appear in the labelling and advertising materials together with the registered name in the same field of vision. The labelling requirements set out in Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 for the presentation of mandatory particulars shall apply to the registered traditional speciality guaranteed.
3.   The Union symbol may be used in the labelling of traditional specialities guaranteed which are produced outside the Union.
4.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, specify the technical characteristics of the Union symbol as well as the technical rules on their use and the use of the indication and the abbreviation on products marketed under a traditional speciality guaranteed, including linguistic versions. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 88(2).
