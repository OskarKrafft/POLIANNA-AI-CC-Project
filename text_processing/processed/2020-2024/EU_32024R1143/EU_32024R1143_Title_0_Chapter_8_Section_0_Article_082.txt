Article 82
Mountain product
1.   The term ‘mountain product’ shall be established as an optional quality term. It shall be reserved as a compound term. It shall only be used to describe products intended for human consumption listed in Annex I to the TFEU in respect of which:
(a)
both the raw materials and the feed for farm animals come essentially from mountain areas;
(b)
in the case of processed products, the processing also takes place in mountain areas.
2.   For the purposes of this Article, mountain areas within the Union are those delimited pursuant to Article 32(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30).
For third-country products, mountain areas shall include areas officially designated as mountain areas by the third country concerned or that meet criteria equivalent to those set out in Article 32(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013.
3.   In duly justified cases and in order to take into account natural constraints affecting agricultural production in mountain areas, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 87 supplementing this Regulation by laying down derogations from the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in particular the conditions under which raw materials or feed are permitted to come from outside the mountain areas, the conditions under which the processing of products is permitted to take place outside the mountain areas in a geographical area to be defined, and the definition of that geographical area.
4.   In order to take into account natural constraints affecting agricultural production in mountain areas, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 87 supplementing this Regulation concerning the establishment of the methods of production and other criteria relevant for the application of the optional quality term referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
