Article 60
National challenge to an application for registration
1.   Member States shall keep the Commission informed of any national administrative or judicial proceedings that may prejudice the registration of a traditional speciality guaranteed.
2.   The Commission shall be exempted from the obligation to meet the deadlines to perform the examination referred to in Article 59(2) and to inform the Member State of the reasons for the delay where it receives a communication from a Member State, concerning an application for registration in accordance with Article 56, which:
(a)
informs the Commission that the decision referred to in Article 56(3) has been invalidated at national level by an immediately applicable but not final administrative or judicial decision; or
(b)
requests the Commission to suspend the examination because national administrative or judicial proceedings have been initiated to challenge the validity of the application and the Member State considers that those proceedings are based on valid grounds.
3.   The exemption shall have effect until the Commission is informed by the Member State that the original application has been restored or that the Member State withdraws its request for suspension.
4.   If the favourable decision of a Member State referred to in Article 56(3) has been invalidated in full or in part by a final decision taken by a national court, the Member State shall consider appropriate action such as withdrawal or modification of the application for registration at Union stage, as necessary.
