Article 7
Sustainability
1.   A producer group, or a recognised producer group where such a group exists, may agree on sustainable practices to be adhered to in the production of the product designated by a geographical indication or in carrying out other activities subject to one or more obligations provided for in the product specification. Such practices shall aim to apply sustainability standards higher than those laid down by Union or national law in terms of environmental, social or economic sustainability or animal welfare.
2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, ‘sustainable practice’ means a practice which contributes to one or more social, environmental or economic objectives, such as:
(a)
climate change mitigation and adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of landscapes, water and soil, the transition to a circular economy, including the reduction of food waste, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems;
(b)
the production of agricultural products in ways that reduce the use of pesticides and manage risks resulting from such use, or that reduce the danger of antimicrobial resistance in agricultural production;
(c)
animal welfare;
(d)
a fair income for producers, diversification of activities, promotion of local agricultural production, and valorisation of the rural fabric and local development;
(e)
preservation of agricultural employment by attracting and sustaining young producers and new producers of products benefiting from a geographical indication;
(f)
improving working and safety conditions in agricultural and processing activities.
3.   Where the producer group, or the recognised producer group where such a group exists, decides that the sustainable practices referred to in paragraph 1 are mandatory for all producers of the product concerned, those practices shall be included in the product specification in accordance with the registration or amendment procedure.
