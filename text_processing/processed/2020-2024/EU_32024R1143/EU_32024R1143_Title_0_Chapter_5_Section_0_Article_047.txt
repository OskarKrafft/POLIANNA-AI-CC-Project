Article 47
Specific rules on sourcing of feed and of raw materials, and on slaughtering
1.   In respect of a product of animal origin, the name of which is registered as a designation of origin, feed shall be sourced entirely from within the defined geographical area.
2.   Insofar as sourcing entirely from within the defined geographical area is not practicable, feed sourced from outside that area may be added, provided that the product quality or characteristics essentially due to the geographical environment are not affected. The amount of feed sourced from outside the defined geographical area shall not exceed 50 % of dry matter on an annual basis.
3.   A temporary amendment, as referred to in Article 24(5), may derogate from paragraph 2 of this Article until the possibility of sourcing feed from within the defined geographical area can be re-established, provided that the link referred to in Article 49(1), point (f)(i), is not entirely voided.
4.   Any restrictions to the origin of raw materials provided in the product specification of a product the name of which is registered as a geographical indication shall be justified with respect to the link referred to in Article 49(1), point (f)(ii).
5.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 87 supplementing this Regulation by laying down derogations and conditions with regard to the slaughtering of live animals and with regard to the sourcing of raw materials. Those derogations and conditions shall be based on objective criteria and shall take into account animal welfare, quality or usage of raw materials and recognised know-how or natural factors, including constraints affecting agricultural production in certain areas.
