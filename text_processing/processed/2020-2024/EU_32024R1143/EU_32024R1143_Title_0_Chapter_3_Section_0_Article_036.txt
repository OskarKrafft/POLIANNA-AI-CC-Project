Article 36
Right to use
A registered geographical indication may be used by any operator marketing a product that complies with the corresponding product specification.
Member States shall ensure that operators are covered by the verification of compliance with the product specification established in accordance with Article 39 of this Regulation or Article 116a of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, as applicable.
In the event that a geographical indication consists of or contains the name of the estate of a single applicant producer, that shall not prevent other operators from using the registered geographical indication provided that it is used to designate a product that complies with the product specification.
