(b)
whose given quality, reputation or other characteristic is essentially attributable to its geographical origin; and
(c)
at least one of the production steps of which takes place in the defined geographical area.
3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, certain names shall be registered as designations of origin even though the raw materials for the products concerned come from a geographical area larger than, or different from, the defined geographical area, provided that:
(a)
the production area of the raw materials is defined;
(b)
special conditions for the production of the raw materials exist;
(c)
there are control arrangements to ensure that the conditions referred to in point (b) are adhered to; and
