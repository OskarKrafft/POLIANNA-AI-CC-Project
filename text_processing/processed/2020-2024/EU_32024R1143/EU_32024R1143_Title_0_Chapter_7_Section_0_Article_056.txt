An applicant producer group shall be an association, irrespective of its legal form, composed of producers of the same product the name of which is proposed for registration or of a single producer where the person concerned is the only producer willing to submit an application. Several applicant producer groups from different Member States or third countries may lodge a joint application for registration. Public bodies and other interested parties may assist in the preparation of the application and in the related procedure.
2.   An application for registration of a name as a traditional speciality guaranteed shall comprise:
(a)
the name and address of the applicant producer group;
(b)
the product specification as provided for in Article 54.
3.   Where the application is prepared by a producer group established in a Member State, the application shall be addressed to the authorities of that Member State. The Member State shall examine the application in order to check that it meets the conditions of the eligibility criteria referred to in Article 53. As part of that examination, the Member State shall conduct a national opposition procedure. If the Member State considers that the requirements of this Chapter are met, it may take a favourable decision and submit an application for registration at Union stage as referred to in Article 58.
4.   The Member State shall ensure that any natural or legal person having a legitimate interest has the opportunity to challenge its decision.
