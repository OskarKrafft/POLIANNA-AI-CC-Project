Article 35
Protection of geographical indication in domain names
1.   Country-code top-level domain name registries established in the Union shall ensure that alternative dispute resolution procedures for domain names recognise registered geographical indications as a right that can be invoked in those procedures.
2.   The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 87 supplementing this Regulation by laying down the provisions entrusting the EUIPO to establish and manage a domain name information and alert system that would provide the applicant upon the submission of an application for a geographical indication with information about the availability of the geographical indication as a domain name and, on an optional basis, about the registration of a domain name identical to their geographical indication. Country-code top-level domain name registries, established in the Union, may provide the EUIPO with the relevant information and data, on a voluntary basis.
3.   By 14 November 2025 the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of the necessity and feasibility of an information and alert system referred to in paragraph 2, taking into account the functioning of the voluntary provision of information and data referred to in that paragraph, and submit a report with its main findings to the European Parliament and the Council. That report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal, where appropriate.
