Article 19
Cumulative and alternative funding
1.   An action that has received a contribution under the Programme may also receive a contribution from any other Union programme, including Funds under the Common Provisions Regulation for 2021-2027, provided that the contributions do not cover the same costs. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution to the action. The cumulative financing shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action, and the support from the different Union programmes may be calculated on a pro-rata basis.
2.   A project may be awarded a Seal of Excellence label as defined in point (45) of Article 2 of the Common Provisions Regulation for 2021-2027 under the Programme where it complies with the following cumulative conditions:
(a)
it has been assessed in a call for proposals under the Programme;
(b)
it complies with the minimum quality requirements of that call for proposals; and
(c)
it cannot be financed under that call for proposals due to budgetary constraints.
A project that has been awarded a Seal of Excellence label in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph may receive support from the European Regional Development Fund or the European Social Fund Plus in accordance with Article 73(4) of the Common Provisions Regulation for 2021-2027.
