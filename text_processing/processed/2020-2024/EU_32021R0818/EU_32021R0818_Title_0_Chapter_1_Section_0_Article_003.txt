Article 3
Programme objectives
1.   The general objectives of the Programme are to:
(a)
safeguard, develop and promote European cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage;
(b)
increase the competitiveness and the economic potential of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the audiovisual sector.
2.   The Programme has the following specific objectives:
(a)
to enhance artistic and cultural cooperation at the European level in order to support the creation of European works and strengthen the economic, social and external dimension of and innovation and mobility in Europe’s cultural and creative sectors;
(b)
to promote competitiveness, scalability, cooperation, innovation and sustainability, including through mobility, in the European audiovisual sector;
(c)
to promote policy cooperation and innovative actions supporting all strands of the Programme and to promote a diverse, independent and pluralistic media environment, and media literacy, thereby fostering freedom of artistic expression, intercultural dialogue and social inclusion.
3.   The Programme shall cover the following strands:
(a)
the Culture strand, which covers cultural and creative sectors with the exception of the audiovisual sector;
(b)
the Media strand, which covers the audiovisual sector;
(c)
the Cross-sectoral strand, which covers actions across all cultural and creative sectors.
4.   Recognising the intrinsic and economic value of culture, the Programme objectives shall be pursued through actions with European added value. European added value shall be ensured, inter alia, through:
(a)
the transnational character of actions and activities, which complement regional, national, international and other Union programmes and policies, thereby promoting European common roots and cultural diversity;
(b)
cross-border cooperation, including through mobility, among organisations and professionals in the cultural and creative sectors, and the potential of such cooperation to address common challenges, including the digital shift, and to promote access to culture, active engagement of citizens and intercultural dialogue;
(c)
the economies of scale and growth and jobs which Union support fosters, creating a leverage effect for additional funds;
(d)
providing a more level playing field through actions with European added value under the Media strand that take into account the specificities of different countries, in particular regarding the production and distribution of content, access to content, the size and specificities of their markets and their cultural and linguistic diversity, in a way that broadens the participation of countries with different audiovisual capacities and strengthens collaboration between those countries.
5.   The Programme objectives shall be pursued in a way that encourages inclusion, equality, diversity and participation, which, where appropriate, shall be achieved through specific incentives that:
(a)
ensure that people with disabilities, people belonging to minorities and people belonging to socially marginalised groups have access to the cultural and creative sectors and that encourage their active participation in those sectors, including in both the creative process and audience development; and
(b)
foster gender equality, in particular as a driver of creativity, economic growth and innovation.
