Article 17
Extension of time limits provided for in Directive 2005/65/EC
1.   Notwithstanding Article 10 of Directive 2005/65/EC, the time limits for the carrying out of the review of port security assessments and port security plans which, in accordance with that Article, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended by 10 months in each case, but in any event not beyond 30 September 2021.
2.   Notwithstanding Article 7(7) of and Annex III to Directive 2005/65/EC, the 18-month time limits for the completion of training exercises which, in accordance with that Annex, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended by 10 months in each case, but in any event not beyond 30 September 2021.
3.   Where a Member State considers that the carrying out of the review of port security assessments or port security plans or the carrying out of training exercises is likely to remain impracticable beyond 30 June 2021, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2, as relevant. That request may concern the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021, the deadlines or the periods of 10 months specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, or any combination thereof. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2021.
4.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 3, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled and that the requested extension does not lead to disproportionate risks in terms of security, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the completion of the review of port security assessments or port security plans or the completion of training exercises is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
5.   Where a Member State has not been, and is not likely to be, confronted by difficulties that rendered the carrying out of the review of port security assessments or port security plans or the carrying out of training exercises impracticable during the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the persistence of the COVID-19 crisis, or has taken appropriate national measures to mitigate such difficulties, that Member State may decide not to apply paragraphs 1 and 2. The Member State shall inform the Commission about its decision by 3 March 2021. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof and shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
