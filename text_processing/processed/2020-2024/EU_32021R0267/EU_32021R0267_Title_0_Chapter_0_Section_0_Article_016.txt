Article 16
Extension of time limits provided for in Regulation (EC) No 725/2004
1.   Notwithstanding Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, the time limits for carrying out the periodic review of port facility security assessments which, in accordance with that provision, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended until 30 September 2021.
2.   Notwithstanding Part B, Sections 13.7 and 18.6, of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, the 18-month time limits for the carrying out of the various types of exercises which, in accordance with those provisions, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended by 10 months in each case, but in any event not beyond 30 September 2021.
3.   Where a Member State considers that the carrying out of port facility security assessments referred to in Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 or of the various types of exercises referred to in Part B, Sections 13.7 and 18.6, of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 is likely to remain impracticable beyond 30 June 2021, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, as relevant. That request may concern the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021, the deadlines or the period of 10 months specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article respectively, or any combination thereof. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2021.
4.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 3, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled and that the requested extension does not lead to disproportionate risks in terms of security, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods and the deadlines specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the carrying out of port facility security assessments or of the various types of exercises is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
5.   Where a Member State has not been, and is not likely to be, confronted by difficulties that rendered the carrying out of port facility security assessments referred to in Article 3(6) of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 or the various types of exercises referred to in Part B Sections 13.7 and 18.6 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 impracticable during the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the persistence of the COVID-19 crisis, or has taken appropriate national measures to mitigate such difficulties, that Member State may decide not to apply paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. The Member State shall inform the Commission about its decision by 3 March 2021. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof and shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
