Article 2
Extension of time limits provided for in Directive 2003/59/EC
1.   Notwithstanding Article 8(2) and (3) of Directive 2003/59/EC, the time limits for the completion, by the holder of a certificate of professional competence (‘CPC’), of periodic training which, in accordance with those provisions, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for a period of 10 months in each case. The CPC shall remain valid accordingly.
2.   The time limits for the completion, by the holder of a CPC, of periodic training which, by application of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2020/698, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for six months or until 1 July 2021, whichever is the later. The CPC shall remain valid accordingly.
3.   The validity of the marking of harmonised Union code, ‘95’ provided for in Annex I to Directive 2006/126/EC made by the competent authorities either on the driving licence or on the driver qualification card referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2003/59/EC on the basis of the CPC referred to in paragraph 1 of that Article shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for a period of 10 months from the date indicated on each such driving licence or driver qualification card.
4.   The validity of the marking of harmonised Union code, ‘95’ provided for in Annex I to Directive 2006/126/EC made by the competent authorities either on the driving licence or on the driver qualification card referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2003/59/EC on the basis of the CPC referred to in paragraph 1 of that Article, which, by application of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2020/698, would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021, shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for six months or until 1 July 2021, whichever is the later.
5.   The validity of driver qualification cards referred to in Annex II to Directive 2003/59/EC which would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for a period of 10 months from the expiry date indicated on each such card.
6.   The validity of driver qualification cards referred to in Annex II to Directive 2003/59/EC which, by application of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2020/698, would otherwise have expired or would expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for six months or until 1 July 2021, whichever is the later.
7.   Where a Member State considers that the completion of periodic training or its certification, the marking of the harmonised Union code, ‘95’, or the renewal of driver qualification cards is likely to remain impracticable beyond 30 June 2021, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraphs 1, 3 and 5, as relevant. That request may concern the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021, or the periods of 10 months specified in paragraphs 1, 3 and 5, as relevant, or both. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2021.
8.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 7, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled and that the requested extension does not lead to disproportionate risks in terms of transport safety and security, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraphs 1, 3 and 5 respectively, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which completion of the periodic training in question or the certification thereof, the marking of the harmonised Union code, ‘95’, or the renewal of driver qualification cards is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
9.   Where a Member State has not been, and is not likely to be, confronted by difficulties that rendered the completion of periodic training or its certification, the marking of the harmonised Union code, ‘95’, or the renewal of driver qualification cards impracticable during the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the persistence of the COVID-19 crisis, or has taken appropriate national measures to mitigate such difficulties, that Member State may decide not to apply paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The Member State shall inform the Commission about its decision by 3 March 2021. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof and shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Member State that has decided not to apply paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 as provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not impede the cross-border activities of any economic operator or individual that has relied on derogations set out in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 that apply in another Member State.
