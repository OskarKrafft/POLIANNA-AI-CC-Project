Article 8
Extension of time limits provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009
1.   Notwithstanding Article 4(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the validity of the Community licences which would otherwise have expired or would otherwise expire between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be deemed to be, or to have been, extended for a period of 10 months. Certified true copies shall remain valid accordingly.
2.   Notwithstanding Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, decisions on applications for authorisation of regular services submitted by the carrier between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 shall be taken by the authorising authority within six months of the date of the submission of the application. Notwithstanding Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the competent authorities of the Member States whose agreement has been requested in respect of such applications in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article shall notify the authorising authority of their decision on the application within three months. Where the authorising authority does not receive a reply within three months, the authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement, and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation.
3.   Where a Member State considers that the renewal of Community licences is likely to remain impracticable beyond 30 June 2021, due to measures that it has taken to prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19, it may submit a reasoned request for an authorisation to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraph 1. That request may concern the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 or the period of 10 months, or both. It shall be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2021.
4.   Where, upon a request submitted in accordance with paragraph 3, the Commission finds that the requirements laid down in that paragraph are fulfilled and that the requested extension does not lead to disproportionate risks in terms of transport safety and security, it shall adopt a decision authorising the Member State concerned to apply an extension of the periods specified in paragraph 1, as justified in each case. The extension shall be limited to reflect the period during which the renewal of Community licences is likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, shall not be longer than six months.
The Commission shall publish that decision in the Official Journal of the European Union.
5.   Where a Member State has not been, and is not likely to be, confronted by difficulties that rendered the renewal of Community licences impracticable during the period between 1 September 2020 and 30 June 2021 as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the persistence of the COVID-19 crisis, or has taken appropriate national measures to mitigate such difficulties, that Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. The Member State shall inform the Commission about its decision by 3 March 2021. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof and shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Member State that has decided not to apply paragraph 1 as provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not impede the cross-border activities of any economic operator or individual that has relied on derogations set out in paragraph 1 that apply in another Member State.
