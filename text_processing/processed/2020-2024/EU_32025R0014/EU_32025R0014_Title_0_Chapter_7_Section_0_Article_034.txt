Article 34
National procedures for dealing with non-road mobile machinery presenting a serious risk or not being in conformity
1.   Where, after having performed the evaluation pursuant to Article 33, the market surveillance authority of a Member State finds that non-road mobile machinery presents a serious risk or is not in conformity with this Regulation, it shall require without delay that the relevant economic operator takes all appropriate corrective measures without delay to ensure that the non-road mobile machinery concerned no longer presents that risk or is brought into conformity. That period shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the risk or non-conformity.
2.   Economic operators shall, in accordance with the obligations set out in Articles 7 to 14, ensure that all appropriate corrective measures are taken in respect of all concerned non-road mobile machinery that they have placed on the market, registered or entered into service.
3.   Where economic operators do not take appropriate corrective measures within the relevant period referred to in paragraph 1 or where the risk requires rapid action, the national authorities shall take all appropriate provisional restrictive measures to prohibit or restrict the making available on the market, the registration, including a prohibition from circulating on public roads, or the entry into service of the concerned non-road mobile machinery, on their national market, or to withdraw them from that market or to recall them.
4.   Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the restrictive measures referred to in paragraph 3.
