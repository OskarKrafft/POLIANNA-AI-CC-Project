Article 25
Amendments to the EU type-approval
1.   Where the approval authority verifies that the particulars recorded in the information package have changed, the approval authority shall grant an amendment to the EU type-approval for which the application was submitted in accordance with Article 24.
2.   The approval authority shall designate the amendment as a ‘revision’ if inspections or tests are not required to be repeated.
In such a case, the approval authority shall issue the revised pages of the information package as necessary, marking each of the revised pages to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of reissue. A consolidated, updated version of the information package, accompanied by a detailed description of the changes, shall be deemed to meet that requirement.
3.   The approval authority shall designate the amendment as an ‘extension’ if any of the following occurs:
(a)
further inspections or tests are required;
(b)
any information on the EU type-approval certificate, with the exception of its attachments, has changed; or
(c)
new requirements under any act adopted pursuant to this Regulation become applicable to the EU type-approved non-road mobile machinery.
4.   When amended pages of the information package or a consolidated, updated version of that package are issued, the index to the information package attached to the EU type-approval certificate shall be amended accordingly to show either the date of the most recent extension or revision or the date of the most recent consolidation of the updated version.
5.   No amendment to the EU type-approval of non-road mobile machinery shall be required if the new requirements referred to in paragraph 3, point (c), are, from a technical point of view, irrelevant to that type of non-road mobile machinery.
