Article 10
General obligations of importers
1.   Importers shall ensure that non-road mobile machinery that they place on the market either belongs to a type that has been granted an EU type-approval and conforms to that type or has been granted an EU individual approval.
2.   Importers shall ensure that the EU type-approved non-road mobile machinery they place on the market bears the statutory plate with marking required by this Regulation and is accompanied by its certificate of conformity.
Importers shall also ensure for the EU type-approved and the EU individually approved non-road mobile machinery they place on the market that the documents, information and instructions for the user have been drawn up as required by this Regulation, and that the obligations set out in Article 7(3) and (4), where applicable, have been fulfilled.
3.   Importers shall indicate their names, registered trade names or registered trade marks, and the postal and email addresses at which they can be contacted on the non-road mobile machinery or, where that is not possible, on its packaging or in a document accompanying that machinery. The address indicated by an importer shall indicate a single point at which that importer can be contacted. Contact details shall be in a language easily understood by users and market surveillance authorities.
4.   Importers shall ensure that, while EU type-approved or EU individually approved non-road mobile machinery is under their responsibility and intended to be made available on the market, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its conformity with the relevant provisions of this Regulation.
