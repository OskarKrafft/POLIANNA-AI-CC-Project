2.   Approval authorities shall approve only non-road mobile machinery that satisfies the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
3.   Approval authorities shall carry out their duties under this Regulation independently and impartially. They shall cooperate efficiently and effectively, and shall share information relevant to their role and functions.
