Article 47
Operational obligations of technical services
1.   Technical services shall carry out the categories of activities for which they have been designated on behalf of the designating approval authority and in accordance with the assessment and test procedures provided for in this Regulation.
2.   Technical services shall supervise or shall themselves carry out the tests required for approval or inspections as set out in this Regulation. The technical services shall not conduct tests, assessments or inspections for which they have not been duly designated by their approval authority.
3.   Technical services shall at all times:
(a)
allow their designating approval authority to witness the technical service during the conformity assessment as appropriate; and
(b)
without prejudice to Article 38(10) and Article 48, provide their designating approval authority with information on their categories of activities falling under the scope of this Regulation as may be requested.
4.   Where a technical service finds that requirements laid down in this Regulation have not been met by a manufacturer, it shall report this to the designating approval authority so that the designating approval authority requires the manufacturer to take appropriate corrective measures and subsequently refrain from issuing an EU type-approval certificate unless the appropriate corrective measures have been taken to the satisfaction of the approval authority.
5.   Where, in the course of monitoring the conformity of production following the issuance of an EU type-approval certificate, a technical service acting on behalf of the designating approval authority finds that non-road mobile machinery is no longer in conformity with this Regulation, it shall report that finding to the designating approval authority. The approval authority shall take the appropriate measures as provided for in Article 23.
