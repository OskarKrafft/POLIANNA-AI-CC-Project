Article 16
Register of SoHO entities
1.   SoHO national authorities shall establish and maintain a register of SoHO entities on their territory. In carrying out that task, SoHO national authorities may make use of the EU SoHO Platform in accordance with Article 74(1). In such case, the SoHO national authority shall instruct SoHO competent authorities, where necessary, and SoHO entities to register directly on the EU SoHO Platform.
2.   In cases where SoHO national authorities establish registries of SoHO entities outside the EU SoHO Platform, the SoHO competent authorities shall submit the information included in such registries to the EU SoHO Platform. SoHO competent authorities shall be responsible for ensuring that the information regarding the SoHO entities on their territory registered pursuant to Article 17 in the register of SoHO entities and on the EU SoHO Platform is consistent, and shall submit any changes in that information to the EU SoHO Platform without undue delay.
3.   The Commission may adopt implementing acts concerning the set of data to be published for registered SoHO entities to facilitate the transfer of information from national registries to the EU SoHO Platform.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 79(2).
