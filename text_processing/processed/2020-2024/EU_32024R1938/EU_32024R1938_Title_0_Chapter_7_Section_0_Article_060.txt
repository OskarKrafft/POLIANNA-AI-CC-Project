Article 60
SoHO release
A SoHO establishment that releases SoHO for distribution or export shall have a procedure in place, under the control of the releasing officer as referred to in Article 49, for SoHO release to ensure that the standards, or elements thereof, referred to in Articles 58 and 59 and their implementation, have been verified and documented prior to release and that all conditions included in any applicable authorisations granted in accordance with this Regulation have been complied with.
SoHO processed for autologous use or within-relationship use, without SoHO storage, shall not require release before human application. In such cases, the SoHO preparation authorisation shall include a specification of the quality control parameters to be monitored during the processing.
