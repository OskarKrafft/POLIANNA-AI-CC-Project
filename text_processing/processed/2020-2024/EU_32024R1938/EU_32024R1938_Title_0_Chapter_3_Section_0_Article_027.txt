In cases where the SoHO establishments follow:

(c)
guidelines other than those referred to in point (a) or (b) of this paragraph, or other technical methods that are not addressed in guidelines, applied in specific circumstances, as referred to in Article 56(4), point (c), and Article 59(4), point (c), the inspectors shall evaluate the steps taken by the SoHO establishments to ensure the adequacy of such guidelines or technical methods, and their compliance with the standards set out in this Regulation; for that evaluation, the SoHO establishments shall provide the inspectors with all the necessary information, pursuant to Article 56(7) and Article 59(7).
