Article 6
Independence and impartiality
1.   When performing their tasks and exercising their powers, SoHO competent authorities shall act independently and impartially, in the public interest and free from any external influence, such as political influence or industry interference.
2.   SoHO competent authorities shall ensure that personnel performing SoHO supervisory activities, including inspectors and assessors, have no financial or other interest that might be considered prejudicial to their independence and, in particular, that they are not placed in a situation that may, directly or indirectly, affect the impartiality of their professional conduct. Personnel performing SoHO supervisory activities shall provide a declaration of their interests and regularly update that declaration. On that basis, SoHO competent authorities shall take the relevant measures to mitigate the risk of conflict of interests.
