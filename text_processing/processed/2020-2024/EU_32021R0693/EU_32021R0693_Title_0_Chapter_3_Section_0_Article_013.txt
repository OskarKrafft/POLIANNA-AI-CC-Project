Article 13
Monitoring and reporting
Indicators to report on the progress of the Programme towards the achievement of the general and specific objectives laid down in Article 3 are set out in Annex II.
To ensure the effective assessment of the Programme’s progress towards the achievement of its objectives, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 15, to amend Annex II with regard to the indicators where considered necessary as well as to supplement this Regulation with provisions on the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework.
The performance reporting system shall ensure that data for monitoring the implementation and the results of the Programme are collected efficiently, effectively and in a timely manner. To that end, proportionate reporting requirements shall be imposed on recipients of Union funds and, where appropriate, on Member States.
The Commission shall report on the performance of the Programme annually to the European Parliament and to the Council, within the existing reporting mechanisms, in particular the EU Justice Scoreboard. In particular, the Commission shall report on the use of the funds allocated to each specific objective. In its report, it shall specify the types of action that have received funding, including actions linked to the promotion of gender equality. On the basis of that report, the European Parliament may make recommendations. The Commission shall duly take those recommendations into account.
