Article 84
Publication of administrative penalties and other administrative measures
1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities and supervisory authorities publish on their official website at least any administrative penalties and other administrative measures imposed by those authorities for infringing the national provisions transposing this Directive where such administrative penalties or other administrative measures have not been the subject of an appeal or where the right of appeal has been exhausted. Such publication shall be made without undue delay after the natural or legal person is informed of that administrative penalty or other administrative measure. The publication shall contain information on the type and nature of the infringement and the identity of the natural or legal person on whom the administrative penalty or other administrative measure is imposed.
Where Member States permit publication of administrative penalties and other administrative measures against which there is an appeal, resolution authorities and supervisory authorities shall, without undue delay, publish on their official websites information on the status of that appeal and the outcome thereof.
2.   Where the resolution authority or supervisory authority considers that the publication of the identity of the legal persons, or identity or personal data of natural persons would be disproportionate following a case-by-case assessment conducted on the proportionality of the publication of such data, or where such a publication would jeopardise the stability of financial markets or an ongoing investigation, the resolution authority or supervisory authority shall do any of the following:
(a)
defer the publication of the decision imposing the administrative penalty or other administrative measures until the reasons for that deferral cease to exist;
(b)
publish the decision imposing the administrative penalty or other administrative measures on an anonymous basis in accordance with national law where such anonymous publication would ensure the effective protection of the personal data concerned;
(c)
not publish the decision imposing the administrative penalty or other administrative measures where the resolution authority or supervisory authority is of the opinion that publication in accordance with point (a) or (b) would be insufficient to ensure either of the following:
(i)
that the stability of financial markets is not jeopardised;
(ii)
the proportionality of the publication of such data with regard to measures which are deemed to be of a minor nature.
Resolution authorities and supervisory authorities shall ensure that any publication in accordance with this Article remains on their official website for a period of at least five years. Personal data contained in the publication shall be kept on the official website of the resolution authority or the supervisory authority only for the period which is necessary according to applicable data-protection rules.
