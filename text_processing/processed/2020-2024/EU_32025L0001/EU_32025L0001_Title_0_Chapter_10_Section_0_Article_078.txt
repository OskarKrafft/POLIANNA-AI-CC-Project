1.   Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities have the powers necessary to act in relation to a Union branch of a third-country undertaking that is not subject to any third-country resolution proceedings or that is subject to third-country proceedings and one of the circumstances referred to in Article 77 applies.
Member States shall ensure that Article 48 applies to the exercise of such powers.
2.   Member States shall ensure that the powers required in paragraph 1 may be exercised by resolution authorities where the resolution authority considers that action is necessary in the public interest and one or more of the following conditions is met:

the Union branch of a third-country undertaking no longer meets, or is likely not to meet, the conditions imposed by national law for its authorisation and operation within that Member State and there is no prospect that any private sector, supervisory or relevant third-country action would restore the branch to compliance or prevent failure in a reasonable timeframe;
(b)
the third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking is, in the opinion of the resolution authority, unable or unwilling, or is likely to be unable, to pay its obligations to Union creditors, or obligations that have been created or booked through the branch, such as payments to policy holders or beneficiaries, as they fall due and the resolution authority is satisfied that no third-country resolution proceedings or insolvency proceedings have been or will be initiated in relation to that third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking in a reasonable timeframe;
(c)
the relevant third-country authority has initiated third-country resolution proceedings in relation to the third-country insurance or reinsurance undertaking, or has notified to the resolution authority its intention to initiate such a proceeding.
3.   Where a resolution authority takes an independent action in relation to a Union branch of a third-country undertaking, it shall have regard to the resolution objectives and take the action in accordance with the following principles and requirements, insofar as they are relevant:
