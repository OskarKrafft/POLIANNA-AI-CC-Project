Article 69
General principles regarding decision-making involving more than one Member State
Member States shall ensure that, when making decisions or taking action pursuant to this Directive which may have an impact in one or more other Member States, their authorities have regard to the following general principles:
(a)
when taking resolution action, decision-making is efficient and resolution costs are kept as low as possible;
(b)
decisions are made and action is taken in a timely manner and with due urgency when required;
(c)
resolution authorities, supervisory authorities and other authorities cooperate with each other to ensure that decisions are made and action is taken in a coordinated and efficient manner;
(d)
the roles and responsibilities of relevant authorities within each Member State are defined clearly;
(e)
due consideration is given to the interests, potential impact of any decisions, actions or inactions and negative effects on policy holders, financial stability, fiscal resources, insurance guarantee schemes, financing arrangements and negative economic and social effects in all the Member States where the ultimate parent undertaking and its subsidiary undertakings operate or where they carry out significant cross-border activities;
(f)
due consideration is given to the objectives of balancing the interests of the various Member States involved and of avoiding unfairly prejudicing or unfairly protecting the interests of particular Member States;
(g)
resolution authorities, when taking resolution actions, take into account and follow the group resolution plans, unless the resolution authorities consider, taking into account the circumstances of the case, that the resolution objectives will be achieved more effectively by taking actions which are not provided for in the resolution plans;
(h)
a proposed decision or action is transparent whenever that decision or action is likely to have implications on the policy holders, real economy, financial stability, fiscal resources, and, where relevant, insurance guarantee schemes and financing arrangements of any Member State concerned.
