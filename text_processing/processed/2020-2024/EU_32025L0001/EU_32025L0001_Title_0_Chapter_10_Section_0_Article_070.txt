2.   The following shall be members of the resolution college:
(a)
the group-level resolution authority;
(b)
the resolution authorities of each Member State in which a subsidiary undertaking covered by group supervision is established;

For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (g), EIOPA shall contribute to promoting and monitoring the efficient, effective and consistent functioning of resolution colleges and convergence across resolution colleges. EIOPA shall be invited to attend the meetings of the resolution college for that purpose. EIOPA shall not have any voting rights.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (h), the participation of the resolution authorities shall be limited to achieving the objectives of an efficient exchange of information.
3.   The resolution authorities of third countries where a parent undertaking or an undertaking established in the Union has a subsidiary insurance or reinsurance undertaking or a branch that would be considered to be significant were it located in the Union may be invited to participate in the resolution college as observers, provided that those authorities are subject to confidentiality requirements that are, in the opinion of the group-level resolution authority, equivalent to those laid down in Article 80.
4.   Where the group is or is part of a financial conglomerate, the authorities designated in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU concerned shall be invited to the resolution college as observers.
5.   The group-level resolution authority shall be the chair of the resolution college. In that capacity it shall:

establish written arrangements and procedures for the functioning of the resolution college, after having consulted the other members of the resolution college;
(b)
coordinate all activities of the resolution college;
(c)
convene and chair all the meetings of the resolution college and keep all members of the resolution college fully informed in advance of the organisation of meetings of the resolution college, of the main issues to be discussed and of the items to be considered;
(d)
notify the members of the resolution college of any planned meetings so that they can request to participate;
(e)
decide which members and observers shall be invited to attend particular meetings of the resolution college, on the basis of specific needs, taking into account the relevance of the issue to be discussed for those members and observers;
(f)
keep all of the members of the college informed, in a timely manner, of the decisions and outcomes of those meetings.
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, point (e), resolution authorities shall be entitled to participate in resolution college meetings whenever matters subject to joint decision-making or relating to a group entity located in their Member State are on the agenda.
6.   Group-level resolution authorities shall not be obliged to establish a resolution college if other groups or colleges perform the same functions and carry out the same tasks specified in paragraph 1 and comply with all the conditions and procedures, including those covering membership and participation in resolution colleges, laid down in this Article and in Article 72. In such a case, all references to resolution colleges in this Directive shall be understood as references to those other groups or colleges.
7.   EIOPA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the operational functioning of the resolution colleges for the performance of the tasks referred to in paragraph 1.
EIOPA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 29 July 2026.
Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Directive by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.
