Article 47
Power in respect of assets, rights, liabilities, shares and other instruments of ownership located in or governed by the law of third countries
1.   Member States shall provide that, in cases in which resolution action involves action taken in respect of assets located in a third country or shares, other instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities governed by the law of a third country, resolution authorities may require that:
(a)
the person exercising control over the undertaking under resolution and the recipient take all steps necessary to ensure that the resolution action becomes effective;
(b)
the person exercising control over the undertaking under resolution hold the shares, other instruments of ownership, assets or rights or discharge the liabilities on behalf of the recipient until the resolution action becomes effective;
(c)
the reasonable expenses of the recipient properly incurred in carrying out any action required under points (a) and (b) are met in any of the ways referred to in Article 26(5).
2.   In order to facilitate potential action pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States shall require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to include into the related agreements contractual terms by which shareholders, creditors or parties to the agreement creating the liability recognise that the liability may be subject to write-down or conversion powers and agree to be bound by any reduction of the principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation that is effected by the exercise of those powers by a resolution authority.
Member States shall ensure that resolution authorities may require entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to provide those resolution authorities with a reasoned legal opinion by an independent legal expert confirming the legal enforceability and effectiveness of such contractual terms.
3.   Where a resolution authority assesses that, in spite of all the necessary steps taken by the person exercising control over the undertaking under resolution in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a), it is highly unlikely that the resolution action will become effective in relation to certain assets located in a third country or certain shares, other instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities governed by the law of a third country, the resolution authority shall not proceed with the resolution action. Where the resolution authority has already ordered the resolution action, that order shall be void in relation to the assets, shares, instruments of ownership, rights or liabilities concerned.
