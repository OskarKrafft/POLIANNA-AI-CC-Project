Article 98
Insurance guarantee schemes
By 29 January 2027, the Commission, after having consulted EIOPA, shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the appropriateness of minimum common standards for insurance guarantee schemes within the Union. That report shall at least:
(a)
assess the state of play of insurance guarantee schemes in Member States (coverage level, types of insurance covered, triggers);
(b)
discuss policy options, including the different policy options such as using insurance guarantee schemes to continue or to liquidate insurance policies, thereby taking due account of the differences in insurance products in various Member States;
(c)
assess the necessity of introducing and, where appropriate, outline the steps necessary to introduce a minimum baseline for insurance guarantee schemes across the Union.
The report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal where appropriate.
