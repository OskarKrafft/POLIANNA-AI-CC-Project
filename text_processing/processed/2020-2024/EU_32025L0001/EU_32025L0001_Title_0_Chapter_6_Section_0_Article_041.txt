Article 41
Removal of procedural obstacles for write-down or conversion
1.   Where the write-down or conversion tool is applied, Member States shall, where applicable, require the entities referred to in Article 1(1), points (a) to (e), to maintain at all times a sufficient amount of authorised share capital or of other Tier 1 instruments to ensure that those undertakings and entities are not prevented from issuing sufficient new shares or other instruments of ownership to ensure that the conversion of liabilities into shares or other instruments of ownership can be carried out effectively.
Resolution authorities shall assess compliance with the requirement laid down in the first subparagraph in the context of the development and maintenance of the resolution plans in accordance with Articles 9 and 10.
2.   Member States shall ensure that there are no procedural impediments to the conversion of liabilities to shares or other instruments of ownership that exist by virtue of their instruments of incorporation or statutes, including pre-emption rights for shareholders or requirements for the consent of shareholders to an increase in capital.
