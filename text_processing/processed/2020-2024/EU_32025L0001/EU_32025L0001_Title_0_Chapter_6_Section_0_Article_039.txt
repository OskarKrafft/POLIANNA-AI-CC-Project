Article 39
Effect of write-down or conversion
1.   Member States shall ensure that, where a resolution authority applies the write-down or conversion tool and exercises the write-down or conversion powers in accordance with Article 35(1) and Article 42(1), points (g) to (k), the reduction of principal or outstanding amount due, conversion or cancellation takes effect and is immediately binding on the undertaking under resolution and affected creditors and shareholders.
2.   The resolution authority shall complete or require the completion of all the administrative and procedural tasks necessary to give effect to the application of the write-down or conversion tool, including:
(a)
the amendment of all registers concerned;
(b)
the delisting, or removal from trading of shares or other instruments of ownership or debt instruments;
(c)
the listing, or admission to trading of new shares or other instruments of ownership;
(d)
the relisting or readmission of any debt instruments which have been written down, without having to issue a prospectus as required by Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21).
3.   Where a resolution authority reduces to zero the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, a liability by means of the power referred to in Article 42(1), point (g), that liability and any obligations or claims arising in relation to it that are not accrued at the time when the power is exercised shall be treated as discharged for all purposes, and shall not be provable in any subsequent proceedings in relation to the undertaking under resolution or any successor entity in any subsequent winding-up.
4.   Where a resolution authority reduces in part, but not in full, the principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of, a liability by means of the power referred to in Article 42(1), point (g):
(a)
the liability shall be discharged to the extent of the amount reduced;
(b)
the instrument concerned or the agreement that created the original liability shall continue to apply in relation to the residual principal amount of, or outstanding amount payable in respect of the liability, subject to any modification of the amount of interest payable to reflect the reduction of the principal amount, and any further modification of the terms that the resolution authority might make by means of the power referred to in Article 42(1), point (l).
