netting arrangements;
(e)
unit-linked policies or other ring-fenced portfolios;

The form of protection that is appropriate, for the classes of arrangements specified in the first subparagraph, points (a) to (g), shall be chosen in accordance with Articles 59 to 62.

(b)
a resolution authority exercises the powers specified in Article 43(1), point (f).

(b)
arise under or are governed in whole or in part by the law of another Member State or of a third country.
