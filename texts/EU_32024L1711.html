The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has also caused uncertainty on the supply of other commodities, such as hard coal and crude oil, used by power-generating installations. That uncertainty has resulted in a substantial additional increase in the volatility of electricity prices. The reduced availability of several nuclear reactors and the low hydropower output have further amplified the increase in electricity prices.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Strengthening the internal energy market and achieving the climate and energy transition objectives require a substantial upgrade of the Union’s electricity network to be able to host vast increases of renewable generation capacity, with weather-dependent variability in generation amounts and changing electricity flow patterns across the Union, and to be able to address new demand such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Investment in grids, within and across borders, is crucial to the proper functioning of the internal electricity market, including security of supply. Such investment is necessary to integrate renewable energy and demand in a context where they are located further apart than in the past and, ultimately, to deliver on the Union climate and energy targets. Therefore, any reform of the Union’s electricity market should contribute to a more integrated European electricity network, with a view to ensuring that each Member State reaches a level of electricity interconnectivity in accordance with the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15 % pursuant to Article 4, point (d)(1), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, that that interconnection capacity is used as much as possible for cross-border trade and that the Union’s electricity network and connectivity infrastructure are built or upgraded, such as the Union projects of common interest established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc15-L_202401711EN.000101-E0015" href="#ntr15-L_202401711EN.000101-E0015"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">15</span>)</a>. Adequate connectivity should be provided to all Union citizens and undertakings as this can result in major opportunities for them to participate in the energy transition and the digital transformation of the Union. Special consideration should be given to the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which recognises their specific constraints and provides for the adoption of specific measures in their regard.</p>

Building on and seizing the potential of the digitalisation of the energy system, such as active participation by consumers, is a key element of future electricity markets and systems in the Union. At the same time, there is a need to respect consumer choices and to allow consumers to benefit from a variety of contractual offers, and to shield household customers from high prices during an energy crisis. Energy system integration is intended to be the planning and operation of the energy system as a whole, across multiple energy carriers, infrastructures, and consumption sectors, by creating stronger links between them, in synergy with each other and supported by digitalisation with the objective of delivering secure, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The connection of new generation and demand installations to the grid, in particular renewable energy plants, often faces delays in grid connection procedures. One of the reasons for such delays is the lack of available grid capacity at the location chosen by the investor, which entails a need for grid extensions or reinforcements to connect the installations to the system in a safe manner. A new requirement for electricity system operators, both at transmission and distribution levels, to publish and update information on the capacity available for new connections in their areas of operation would give investors easier access to information of grid capacity availability within the system and thereby accelerate decision-making which, in turn, would accelerate the required deployment of renewable energy. That information should be updated on a regular basis, at least quarterly, by distribution system operators. While Member States should be able to decide not to apply that requirement to electricity undertakings which serve less than 100 000 connected customers or which serve small isolated systems, they should encourage those undertakings to provide system users with that information once a year and should promote cooperation between distribution system operators for that purpose. Distribution system operators should also publish the criteria used to determine the available grid capacities, such as existing demand and generation capacities, the assumptions made for assessing the possible further integration of additional system users, the relevant information on possible energy curtailment, and the expectation of upcoming relevant network developments.</p>

System operators should offer the possibility of establishing flexible connection agreements in such areas. The regulatory authority or another competent authority where a Member State has so provided, should develop frameworks for system operators to establish such flexible connections, ensuring that network reinforcements that provide the structural solutions are prioritised, connection agreements are made firm as soon as the networks are ready, flexible connections are enabled as a permanent solution for areas where network reinforcement is not efficient and, to the extent possible, give visibility to the network users requesting grid connection on the expected curtailment levels under the flexible connection agreement.</p>

Consequently, many household customers have been facing financial difficulties and have been unable to pay their bills. Vulnerable customers and customers affected by energy poverty were hit hardest, but middle-income household customers were also exposed to such difficulties. High energy prices could also have a negative impact on the health, well-being and overall quality of life of consumers. It is therefore important to improve consumer rights and protection, allowing consumers to benefit from the energy transition, decouple their electricity bills from short-term price movements on energy markets and rebalance the risk between suppliers and consumers.</p>

Consumers should always have the possibility to opt for an affordable fixed-price, fixed-term electricity supply contract and suppliers should not be able to unilaterally modify contractual terms and conditions or to terminate the contract before it reaches its maturity. Nevertheless, dynamic price contracts remain essential and an increasing penetration of renewable energy sources can help consumers to reduce their energy bills. Member States should be able to exempt suppliers with more than 200 000 final customers who offer only dynamic price contracts from the obligation to offer fixed-term, fixed-price electricity supply contracts, provided that such an exemption does not have a negative impact on competition and retains sufficient choice of fixed-term, fixed-price electricity supply contracts.</p>

Hence, suppliers should be appropriately hedged when offering fixed-term, fixed-price electricity supply contracts. An appropriate hedging strategy should take into account the suppliers’ access to its own generation and its capitalisation as well as its exposure to changes in wholesale market prices, the size of the supplier or the market structure. The existence of appropriate hedging strategies can be ensured by general rules overseen without undertaking a specific review of the positions or strategies of individual suppliers. Stress tests and reporting requirements on suppliers could be tools by which to assess supplier hedging strategies.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Consumers should be able to choose the supplier which offers them the price and service which best suits their needs. Advances in metering and sub-metering technology combined with information and communication technology make it technically possible to have multiple suppliers for individual premises. Customers should be able to choose a separate supplier in particular for electricity to power appliances such as heat pumps or electric vehicles which have a particularly high consumption or which also have the capability to shift their electricity consumption automatically in response to price signals. To that end, customers should be allowed to have more than one metering and billing point covered by the single connection point for their premises, allowing different appliances to be metered and supplied separately. Metering points should be clearly distinguished from each other and should comply with applicable technical rules. The rules for the allocation of the associated costs should be determined by the Member States. Some smart metering systems are able to directly cover more than one metering point and therefore enable customers to have more than one electricity supply contract or energy sharing agreement at the same time. Suppliers should have balancing responsibility only for metering and billing points to which they supply. Moreover, by enabling the use of dedicated measurement solutions, attached to or embedded in appliances with flexible, controllable loads, final customers can participate in other incentive-based demand response schemes that provide flexibility services on the electricity market and to transmission system operators and distribution system operators. Overall, such arrangements should be compatible with energy sharing and should contribute to the increased uptake of demand response and to consumer empowerment, thereby allowing customers to have more control over their energy use and bills, while providing the electricity system with additional flexibility in order to cope with supply and demand fluctuations.</p>

Therefore, suppliers or market participants engaged in aggregation should provide the key information about energy offers to consumers in a concise and easily understandable manner prior to the conclusion or extension of a contract.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To ensure continuity of supply for consumers, particularly in cases of supplier failure, Member States should have in place a supplier-of-last-resort regime. It should be possible to appoint the supplier of last resort either before or at the moment of supplier failure. Such a supplier of last resort may be treated as a provider of universal service. A supplier of last resort might be the sales division of a vertically integrated undertaking which also performs distribution functions, provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of Directive (EU) 2019/944. However, this does not imply an obligation of Member States to supply at a certain fixed minimum price. Where a Member State obliges a supplier of last resort to supply electricity to a customer who does not receive market-based offers, the conditions set out in Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 apply and the obligation can involve a regulated price only to the extent that the customer is entitled to benefit from regulated prices. When assessing whether offers received by non-household customers are market-based, Member States should take into account the individual commercial and technical circumstances. Where, before 16 July 2024, a Member State has already appointed a supplier of last resort through a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure, it is not necessary to launch a new procedure for appointing the supplier of last resort.</p>

With the integration of appropriate price signals and storage facilities, electricity sharing can contribute to laying the foundation to help tap into the flexibility potential of smaller consumers. The provisions on energy sharing laid down in this Directive complement the provisions concerning self-consumption laid down in Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and in Article 15 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, in particular with respect to collective self-consumption.</p>

In the case of customers participating in energy sharing schemes larger than small and medium-sized enterprises, the size of the installed capacity of the generation facility associated to the energy sharing scheme should be of a maximum of 6 MW and the energy sharing should take place within a local or limited geographical area, as defined by Member States.

Member States should put in place the appropriate IT infrastructure to allow for the administrative matching within a certain time frame of customer’s total metered consumption with self-generated or stored renewable energy which is deducted from the total consumption for the purpose of calculating the energy component of the energy bill issued by the supplier and thereby reducing the customer’s bill. The output of those facilities should be distributed among the aggregated consumer load profiles based on static, variable or dynamic calculation methods that can be pre-defined or agreed upon by the active customers. Active customers engaged in energy sharing are financially responsible for the imbalances that they cause, without prejudice to the possibility for active customers to delegate their balancing responsibilities to other market participants. All consumer rights and obligations set out in Directive (EU) 2019/944 apply to final customers involved in energy sharing schemes. However, households with an installed capacity up to 10,8 kW for single households and up to 50 kW for multi-apartment blocks should not be required to comply with supplier obligations. Member States should be able to adjust those thresholds to reflect national circumstances, up to 30 kW for single households and to between 40 kW and 100 kW for multi-apartment blocks.</p>

The role of suppliers and all relevant national authorities to identify appropriate measures, in both the short and the long term, which should be made available to vulnerable customers and customers affected by energy poverty to manage their energy use and costs remains essential, and suppliers and relevant national authorities should cooperate closely with social security authorities.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Public interventions in price setting for the supply of electricity would constitute, in principle, a market-distortive measure. Such interventions should therefore be carried out only where appropriate and as public service obligations and should be subject to specific conditions. Under this Directive, regulated prices are possible for vulnerable customers and customers affected by energy poverty, including below costs, and, as a transition measure, for household customers and microenterprises whether or not there is an electricity price crisis. During an electricity price crisis, when wholesale and retail electricity prices increase significantly, Member States should be allowed to temporarily extend the application of regulated prices to small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises. As regards household customers and small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises, Member States should, exceptionally and temporarily, be allowed to set regulated prices below cost during an electricity price crisis provided that this does not create distortions between suppliers and that suppliers are compensated for the costs of supplying below cost. However, it is necessary to ensure that such price regulation is targeted and does not create incentives to increase consumption. Therefore, such exceptional and temporary extension of price regulation should be limited to 80 % of median household consumption for household customers and to 70 % of the previous year’s consumption for small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises. The Council should be able, acting on a proposal from the Commission, by means of an implementing decision, to declare a regional or Union-wide electricity price crisis. The assessment of whether such an electricity price crisis exists should be based on a comparison with prices in times of normal market operation and therefore should exclude the impact of previous electricity price crises declared pursuant to this Directive. Such implementing decision should also specify the period of validity of the declaration of an electricity price crisis, during which the temporary extension of regulated prices applies. That period should not be longer than one year. Where the conditions for that electricity price crisis declaration continue to be fulfilled, it should be possible for the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, to extend the period of validity of the implementing decision. The conferral of implementing powers on the Council is justified given the significant horizontal implications for Member States of a decision declaring an electricity price crisis and thereby to trigger the extended possibilities for public interventions in price setting for the supply of electricity. Such implications are significant in terms both of the number of customers concerned and of the importance of the categories of such customers. The conferral of implementing powers on the Council also adequately takes into account the political nature of such a decision declaring an electricity price crisis, which requires a delicate balancing of different policy considerations central to Member States’ decision to implement price-setting for energy. In the case of vulnerable customers and customers affected by energy poverty, the price regulation applied by Member States could cover 100 % of the price in accordance with Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944. In any event, the declaration of a regional or Union-wide electricity price crisis should ensure a level playing field across all Member States affected by the decision so that the internal market is not unduly distorted.</p>

While progress towards synchronisation is ongoing, one of the critical prerequisites for stable synchronous system operation is the availability of sufficient balancing capacity reserves for frequency regulation. However, being dependent on the Russian synchronous area for frequency management, the Baltic States were not yet in the position to develop their own functioning balancing market. The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has substantially increased the risk for security of supply resulting from the absence of own balancing markets. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should therefore be exempt from the requirements of certain provisions of Article 40(4) and Article 54(2) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 insofar as that is necessary to ensure system security for a transitional period. The transitional periods for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should be phased out as soon as possible after the synchronisation, and should be used to develop the appropriate market instruments that offer short-term balancing reserves and other indispensable ancillary services, and should be limited to the time necessary for that process.</p>
