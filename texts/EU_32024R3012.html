The Union certification framework will thus be a tool to support the achievement of the Union objectives under the Paris Agreement, in particular the collective achievement by 2050 of the climate-neutrality objective laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc5-L_202403012EN.000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_202403012EN.000101-E0005"

Therefore, in order to avoid double counting, those carbon removals and soil emission reductions should not contribute to third-party NDCs or international compliance schemes. The Union also committed to generating negative emissions after 2050.

Therefore, this Regulation should provide clear definitions of permanent carbon removals, carbon farming and carbon storage in products, and other elements of the Union certification framework. Its scope should include activities that enhance carbon storage in geological, terrestrial or marine reservoirs, including oceans, and in long-lasting products. Activities should include one or more practices or processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere. Certain activities, such as those based on the use of biochar, can result in different types of net carbon removal benefits and durations of carbon storage, depending on the specific conditions under which the activities take place. Accordingly, appropriate monitoring and liability rules should be set out in the applicable certification methodologies to be established at Union level pursuant to this Regulation.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In the first step for quantifying the net carbon removal benefit or the net soil emission reduction benefit, operators should quantify the amount of additional carbon removals or soil emission reductions that an activity has generated in comparison to a baseline. In the case of carbon farming, the manner of quantification of carbon removals or soil emission reductions should ensure that any carbon release occurring in a carbon pool is taken into account in an appropriate way in quantifying the net benefit of the activity. The certification methodologies should establish standardised baselines which should be highly representative of the standard performance of comparable practices and processes in similar social, economic, environmental, regulatory and technological circumstances and take into account the geographical context, including local pedoclimatic and regulatory conditions. This approach to establishing the standardised baselines should be preferred because it ensures objectivity, minimises compliance and other administrative costs, and recognises positively the action of first movers who have already engaged in eligible activities. In the context of carbon farming, only practices and processes that go beyond the common practice should be certified. Therefore, a specific carbon farming activity should not be rewarded if it is already widely adopted within a region with similar pedoclimatic and regulatory conditions. The standardised baselines should ensure that, once an activity becomes the common practice, such activity can no longer be certified. To that end, the Commission should review at least every five years and update, where appropriate, the standardised baselines in light of evolving regulatory circumstances and of the latest available scientific evidence, to reflect social, economic, environmental, regulatory and technological developments and to encourage increased ambition over time in line with the Paris Agreement. In addition, the use of available digital technologies, including electronic databases and geographic information systems, remote sensing, novel on-site carbon quantification systems, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and of electronic maps should be promoted to decrease the costs of establishing standardised baselines and ensure the robustness of the monitoring of the activities. However, where it is not possible to set such standardised baselines, an activity-specific baseline based on the operator’s individual performance should be used. The activity-specific baselines should be updated by the operator at the beginning of each activity period, unless otherwise stated in the applicable certification methodologies.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The second step for quantifying the net benefit should consist of subtracting any associated greenhouse gas emissions occurring during the lifecycle of the activity and related to the implementation of the activity. Relevant greenhouse gas emissions that should be taken into consideration include direct emissions, such as those resulting from the use of fertilisers, chemicals, fuel or energy, other material inputs and transportation, or indirect emissions, such as those resulting from land use change with consequent risks for food security due to displacement of agricultural production, or displacement effects due to competing demand for energy or waste heat. Any increase in greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the implementation of the activity should be subtracted from the net carbon removal benefit or from the net soil emission reduction benefit in an appropriate way, in accordance with the technical rules set out in the applicable certification methodology. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the implementation of the activity, with the exception of the reduction of soil emissions from agricultural soils, should not be taken into account to quantify the net carbon removal benefit or the net soil emission reduction benefit, but should be considered to provide a co-benefit towards the sustainability objective of climate change mitigation and be reported on the certificates of compliance. Such reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, like the other sustainability co-benefits, could increase the value of the certified carbon removals or soil emission reductions.</p>

For instance, in the case of permanent carbon removals that inject carbon underground, the amount of permanently stored carbon should exceed the energy-related greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial process. Similarly, in the case of soil emission reductions through carbon farming, the net soil emission reduction benefit is positive if the soil emission reductions compared to the baseline exceed any increase in greenhouse gas emissions associated with the implementation of the activity. Carbon farming activities generally improve soil quality, which has a positive impact on soil resilience and productivity, but in some circumstances they might also generate a decrease in food production and therefore lead to a carbon leakage effect from indirect land use change, and accordingly the related indirect emissions should be taken into account. Any carbon captured and stored by afforestation or soil emission reduction by means of peatland re-wetting should exceed the emissions from the machinery used to carry out the activity or the indirect land use change emissions that could be caused by carbon leakage.</p>

If an activity is imposed upon operators by the applicable law, or it does not need any incentives to take place, its performance will be reflected in such standardised baselines. For this reason, an activity that generates carbon removals or soil emission reductions in excess of such a baseline should be presumed to be additional. Hence, the use of a standardised baseline would simplify the demonstration of additionality for operators, and it would reduce the administrative burden of the certification process, which is particularly important in the case of small-scale operators.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Atmospheric or biogenic carbon that is captured and stored through permanent carbon removals, carbon farming or carbon storage in products risks being released back into the atmosphere due to natural or anthropogenic causes. Therefore, operators should take all relevant preventive measures to mitigate those risks and duly monitor whether carbon continues to be stored over the monitoring period set for the relevant activity. The validity of the certified unit should depend on the expected duration of the storage and the different risks of reversal associated with the given activity. Permanent carbon removals provide enough certainties as to the very long-term duration of storage, namely a duration of several centuries. Products with permanently chemically bound carbon present a very low or no risk of carbon release. Carbon farming and carbon storage in products are more exposed to the risk of voluntary or involuntary release of carbon into the atmosphere. To account for that risk, the validity of the carbon farming sequestration unit and the carbon storage in product unit should be subject to an expiry date coinciding with the end of the relevant monitoring period, which should cover at least 35 years for carbon storage in products. Thereafter, the carbon captured and stored should be considered released into the atmosphere, unless the operator or group of operators commits to prolonging the monitoring period. The certification methodologies should promote the prolongation of the monitoring period of the relevant carbon farming activities, with the aim of ensuring that CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> captured is stored long-term in soils or biomass and of providing financial incentives to carbon farming operators over the long term. To that end, it is appropriate that the certification methodologies incentivise operators to prolong the monitoring period several times, with the aim of storing captured carbon for at least several decades.</p>

Therefore, it is appropriate to establish minimum sustainability requirements to ensure that those activities do no significant harm to the environment and are able to generate co-benefits for the objectives of: climate change mitigation and adaptation; the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, including soil health and avoidance of land degradation; the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a circular economy, including the efficient use of sustainably sourced bio-based materials; and pollution prevention and control. Carbon farming activities should at least generate co-benefits for the objective of protection and restoration of biodiversity and eco-systems, including soil health as well as avoidance of land degradation. Those minimum sustainability requirements should take into account the impact of the activity both within and outside the Union as well as local conditions, and, where appropriate, be consistent with the technical screening criteria for the ‘do no significant harm’ principle, and be in line with the sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria for forest and agriculture biomass raw material laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Practices that produce harmful effects on biodiversity, such as forest monocultures producing harmful effects on biodiversity, should not be eligible for certification.</p>

When developing certification methodologies in the context of carbon farming, the Commission should take into account the need to contribute to ensuring food security, the need to promote the protection and the restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, and the need to avoid the acquisition of land for speculative purposes resulting in negative effects on rural communities, as well as the need to respect the rights of local communities and indigenous people affected by those activities, where relevant in accordance with national law, both within and outside the Union. It should promote those activities that have the largest potential to provide positive co-benefits for biodiversity, as well as consider long-term forest structure, the long-term stability of carbon pools, ecosystem health, resilience and the risk of natural disturbances.</p>

To that end, their reporting should comply with the certification methodologies tailored to the different carbon removal activities, developed by the Commission. Certification methodologies should, as much as possible, incentivise the generation of co-benefits for biodiversity going beyond the minimum sustainability requirements, with a view to generating a market premium for the certified units, by including, for instance, positive lists of activities that are deemed to generate co-benefits. Those additional co-benefits would give more economic value to the certified units and would result in higher revenues for the operators. In the light of those considerations, it is appropriate that the Commission prioritise the development of tailored certification methodologies for carbon farming activities that provide significant co-benefits for biodiversity, and contribute to the sustainable management of agricultural land and forests.</p>

The Innovation Fund sets out rules relevant for the development of certification methodologies for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and direct air capture. In order to avoid an unsustainable demand for biomass raw material, the financial benefits related to the certification should not lead to an increase of the capacity of a bioenergy plant beyond what is necessary for the operation of the carbon capture and storage. It is appropriate that certification methodologies related to activities storing carbon in the marine environment, including oceans, take into account international progress in carbon removal reporting and the latest scientific information available and, when available, the findings of the Commission’s report prepared pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/841. Furthermore, in order to promote the sustainable and efficient use of limited biomass resources, it is appropriate that certification methodologies related to activities using biomass ensure that the principle of the cascading use of biomass as laid down in Article 3(3) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 is applied, while relying on existing rules and procedures and avoiding duplication. The rules for the implementation by national authorities of that principle are laid down in Article 3(3), (3a) and (3b) of that Directive.</p>

All activities should also be subject to periodic re-certification audits at least every five years, or otherwise more frequently as specified in the applicable certification methodology based on the characteristics of the relevant activity. The re-certification audits should verify the compliance of the activity with the quality criteria of this Regulation and the net carbon removal benefit or net soil emission reduction benefit generated by the activity.

This could be done with new market-based mechanisms to boost sustainable food, as this could result both in a better food price to reflect sustainability, as well as a fair reward for farmers and new source of funding for investments. Only firm coordination with all industrial actors in the entire food value chain and focus on fair trading practices across that chain can unlock the right incentives for sustainable farming practices, ensure a decent and sustainable income for farmers and generate revenues to support the transition.</p>

They should also ensure that there is correct accounting of the certified carbon removal or soil emission reduction units, in particular by avoiding double counting. To that end, the Commission should adopt implementing acts setting out technical harmonised rules on certification, including adequate standards of reliability, transparency and accounting and of independent auditing to be applied by certification schemes, so as to ensure the necessary legal certainty as regards the rules applicable to operators and to certification schemes. To ensure a cost-effective certification process, those technical harmonised rules on certification should also have the objective of reducing an unnecessary administrative burden on operators, or groups of operators, in particular on small and medium enterprises, including small farmers and small forest owners and managers.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In order to ensure transparency and full traceability of certified units, and to avoid the risk of fraud and double counting, the Commission should establish within four years of the date of entry into force of this Regulation and thereafter maintain a Union registry for permanent carbon removals, carbon farming and carbon storage in products (the ‘Union registry’). The Commission should take into account the reports referred to in Article 30(5), point (a), of Directive 2003/87/EC and Article 17(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/841. Where a concern related to fraud is raised, the Commission should investigate the matter and take appropriate action, including by repealing relevant decisions or cancelling the affected units. For example, fraud could be deemed to have been committed if more than one certificate of compliance is issued for the same activity because the activity has been registered under two different certification schemes or has been registered twice under the same scheme. Fraud could also be deemed to have been committed when the same certificate of compliance is used several times to make the same claim based on an activity or a certified unit. The Union registry should use automated systems, including electronic templates, to make publicly accessible, as a minimum, the information set out in an Annex to this Regulation. The operation of the Union registry should be financed by annual fixed fees payable by users, proportionate to their use of the Union registry, and sufficient to contribute to the coverage of its establishment costs and its annual operating costs, such as those for staff or IT tools. Resources from such fees should constitute external assigned revenue for the purpose of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc16-L_202403012EN.000101-E0016" href="#ntr16-L_202403012EN.000101-E0016"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">16</span>)</a>. They should, in particular, cover the costs of IT tools, services and security, including the operation and licensing systems, and the costs of staff working on the management of the Union registry. The Commission should, by means of delegated acts, set out the necessary requirements concerning the Union registry and the factors to be considered for determining the level of user fees and their recovery. When setting out those requirements, the Commission should also consider the need to ensure sufficient oversight of the trading of certified units. During each last quarter of the year preceding the calendar year of application, the Commission should adopt one or more implementing acts to set out or revise the individual amounts of user fees to be applied for that calendar year. Until the establishment of the Union registry, certification schemes recognised by the Commission should establish and maintain interoperable certification registries. In order to ensure that there is transparency and full traceability in relation to certified units, and to avoid the risk of fraud and double counting, the certification schemes should also use automated systems, including electronic templates, to make publicly available, as a minimum, the information set out in an Annex to this Regulation. In order to ensure a level playing field within the internal market, the Commission should adopt implementing acts setting out standards and technical rules on the functioning and the interoperability of those certification registries. Certified units should be issued by certification registries or, once established, by the Union registry only after the generation of a net carbon removal benefit or net soil emission reduction benefit, based on a valid certificate of compliance resulting from a re-certification audit. To avoid double issuance and double use, any certified unit should not be issued more than once and should not be used by more than one natural or legal person at any point in time. Permanent carbon removal units, carbon farming sequestration units, carbon storage in product units and soil emission reduction units should remain distinct from one another. In order to account for the inherent risk of reversal of removed carbon, carbon farming sequestration units and carbon storage in product units should expire at the end of the monitoring period for the relevant activity, and be cancelled in the certification registry or, once established, in the Union registry, unless the operator or the group of operators commits to prolonging the monitoring period, in accordance with the rules set out in the applicable certification methodology.</p>

It should also determine whether it is appropriate to differentiate end-uses for each type of unit, as well as identify the corresponding requirements for the use of units by private actors or third parties, including for the voluntary carbon markets and international compliance schemes, ensuring consistency with relevant Union legal acts such as Regulations (EU) 2018/1999 and (EU) No 2021/1119, and Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc22-L_202403012EN.000101-E0022" href="#ntr22-L_202403012EN.000101-E0022"
