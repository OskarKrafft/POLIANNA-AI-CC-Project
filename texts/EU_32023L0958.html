The Parties to the Paris Agreement have agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. That commitment has been reinforced with the adoption under the UNFCCC of the Glasgow Climate Pact on 13 November 2021, in which the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, recognises that keeping the increase in the global average temperature to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, and those Parties committed to strengthen their 2030 targets by the end of 2022 in order to accelerate climate action in this critical decade and to close the ambition gap with the 1,5 °C target. In order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, all sectors of the economy, including international aviation, need to contribute to achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions.</p>

Aviation is the second biggest source of transport climate impacts after road transport. In 2022, Eurocontrol projected an increase in European aviation activity of 44 % by 2050 compared to 2019. The need for action to reduce CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions is becoming increasingly urgent, as stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its latest reports of 7 August 2021 entitled ‘Climate change 2021: The Physical Science Basis’, of 28 February 2022 entitled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, and of 4 April 2022 entitled ‘Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change’. That report of 4 April 2022 identifies international aviation as a sector where sectoral agreements have adopted climate mitigation goals that fall far short of what would be required to achieve the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The Union should therefore address that urgent need for action by stepping up its efforts and establishing itself as an international leader in the fight against climate change.</p>

Those amendments are therefore also aimed at the implementation of the Union’s contributions under the Paris Agreement as regards aviation. Therefore, the total quantity of allowances for aviation should be consolidated and subject to the linear reduction factor as referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC.</p>

The climate impact of such non-CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions depends on the type of fuel and engines used, on the location of the emissions, in particular the cruise altitude of the aircraft, and its position in terms of latitude and longitude, as well as the time of the emissions and the weather conditions at that time. Based upon the Commission’s impact assessment of 2006 on the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS, Directive 2008/101/EC recognised that aviation has an impact on the global climate through the release of non-CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions.

To fulfil that requirement, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) conducted an updated analysis of the non-CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> effects of aviation on climate change and published its study on 23 November 2020. The findings of that study confirmed what had been previously estimated, namely that the non-CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> climate impacts of aviation activities are, in total, at least as significant as those of CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> alone.</p>

The transition from the use of fossil fuels would play a role in achieving such decarbonisation. However, considering the high level of competition between aircraft operators, the developing Union market for sustainable aviation fuels, and the significant price differential between fossil kerosene and sustainable aviation fuels, that transition should be supported by incentivising early movers. Therefore, during the period from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2030, 20 million allowances should be reserved in order to be allocated to cover part of the remaining price differential between fossil kerosene and the eligible aviation fuels for individual aircraft operators. Those allowances should come from the pool of total allowances available for aviation and should be allocated, in a non-discriminatory manner, only for flights covered by the surrender obligation of Directive 2003/87/EC. Following an evaluation of the functioning of that reserve, the Commission could decide to submit a legislative proposal to allocate a capped and time-limited amount of allowances. Such allocation should only last until 31 December 2034.</p>

Nevertheless, current trends show intensive research into the re-introduction of supersonic aviation.

In order to assess the implementation of CORSIA, the pilot phase of which has begun, and how it is applied in practice, the current derogation from EU ETS obligations should be extended for surrender obligations until 31 December 2026 concerning flights operated by aircraft operators on routes not covered by CORSIA to and from relevant third countries, in respect of which EU ETS reporting and surrender obligations would otherwise apply by 31 March 2027 and 30 September 2027. That should be the last time-bound derogation to the EU ETS. A review of CORSIA should take place by 1 July 2026. If the ICAO Assembly by 31 December 2025 has not strengthened CORSIA in line with achieving its long-term global aspirational goal towards meeting the Paris Agreement goals or if the States listed in an implementing act to be adopted by the Commission represent less than 70 % of international aviation emissions using the most recent available data, then the Commission should propose, as appropriate, that the EU ETS apply to emissions from departing flights from 2027, and that aircraft operators be able to deduct any costs incurred from CORSIA offsetting on those routes, to avoid double charging. In parallel, if a third country does not apply CORSIA from 2027, the EU ETS should apply to emissions from flights departing to that third country.</p>

In order to safeguard air connectivity for flights serving island regions or small airports, the mechanism under this Directive, which is designed to bridge the remaining price differential between fossil fuels and alternatives thereto, should limit adverse impacts on air connectivity and mitigate the risk of carbon leakage. By 2026, the Commission should report on possible effects on air connectivity.</p>
