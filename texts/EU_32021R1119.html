That report confirms that greenhouse gas emissions need to be urgently reduced, and that climate change needs to be limited to 1,5 °C, in particular to reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events and of reaching tipping points. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has shown in its 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services a worldwide erosion of biodiversity, with climate change as the third most important driver of biodiversity loss.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Climate action should be an opportunity for all sectors of the economy in the Union to help secure industry leadership in global innovation. Driven by the Union’s regulatory framework and efforts made by industry, it is possible to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Union greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 24 % between 1990 and 2019, while the economy grew by 60 % over the same period. Without prejudice to binding legislation and other initiatives adopted at Union level, all sectors of the economy – including energy, industry, transport, heating and cooling and buildings, agriculture, waste and land use, land-use change and forestry, irrespective of whether those sectors are covered by the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (‘EU ETS’) – should play a role in contributing to the achievement of climate neutrality within the Union by 2050. In order to enhance involvement of all economic actors, the Commission should facilitate sector-specific climate dialogues and partnerships by bringing together key stakeholders in an inclusive and representative manner, so as to encourage sectors themselves to draw up indicative voluntary roadmaps and to plan their transition towards achieving the Union’s climate-neutrality objective by 2050. Such roadmaps could make a valuable contribution in assisting sectors in planning the necessary investments towards the transition to a climate-neutral economy and could also serve to strengthen sectoral engagement in the pursuit of climate-neutral solutions. Such roadmaps could also complement existing initiatives, including the European Battery Alliance and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, which foster industrial collaboration in the transition to climate neutrality.</p>

The European Council, in its conclusions of 12 December 2019, has agreed on the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, while also recognising that it is necessary to put in place an enabling framework that benefits all Member States and encompasses adequate instruments, incentives, support and investments to ensure a cost-efficient, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition, taking into account different national circumstances in terms of starting points. It also noted that the transition will require significant public and private investment. On 6 March 2020, the Union submitted its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy and, on 17 December 2020, its nationally determined contribution, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), following their approval by the Council.</p>

That objective should encompass Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals regulated in Union law. It should be possible to address such emissions and removals in the context of the review of the relevant climate and energy legislation. Sinks include natural and technological solutions, as reported in the Union’s greenhouse gas inventories to the UNFCCC. Solutions that are based on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and use (CCU) technologies can play a role in decarbonisation, especially for the mitigation of process emissions in industry, for the Member States that choose this technology. The Union-wide 2050 climate-neutrality objective should be pursued by all Member States collectively, and Member States, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should take the necessary measures to enable its achievement. Measures at Union level will constitute an important part of the measures needed to achieve the objective.</p>

A European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (the ‘Advisory Board’) should be established to serve as a point of reference on scientific knowledge relating to climate change by virtue of its independence and scientific and technical expertise. The Advisory Board should complement the work of the European Environment Agency (EEA) while acting independently in discharging its tasks. Its mission should avoid any overlap with the mission of the IPCC at international level.

The Commission did so on the basis of a comprehensive impact assessment and taking into account its analysis of the integrated national energy and climate plans submitted to it in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc12-L_2021243EN.01000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_2021243EN.01000101-E0012"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">12</span>)</a>. In light of the 2050 climate-neutrality objective, by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced and removals enhanced, so that net greenhouse gas emissions, that is emissions after the deduction of removals, are reduced economy-wide and domestically by at least 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The European Council endorsed that target in its conclusions of 10 and 11 December 2020. It also provided initial guidance on its implementation. That new Union 2030 climate target is a subsequent target for the purposes of point (11) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and therefore replaces the 2030 Union-wide target for greenhouse gas emissions set out in that point. In addition, the Commission should, by 30 June 2021, assess how the relevant Union legislation implementing the Union 2030 climate target would need to be amended in order to achieve such net emission reductions. In view of this, the Commission has announced a revision of the relevant climate and energy legislation which will be adopted in a package covering, inter alia, renewables, energy efficiency, land use, energy taxation, CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emission performance standards for light-duty vehicles, effort sharing and the EU ETS.</p>

The Commission can make proposals to revise the intermediate target, taking into account the findings of the assessments of Union progress and measures and of national measures as well as the outcomes of the global stocktake and of international developments, including on common time frames for nationally determined contributions. As a tool to increase the transparency and accountability of the Union’s climate policies, the Commission should, when making its legislative proposal for the Union 2040 climate target, publish the projected indicative Union greenhouse gas budget for the 2030-2050 period, defined as the indicative total volume of net greenhouse gas emissions that are expected to be emitted in that period without putting at risk the Union’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, as well as the methodology underlying that indicative budget.</p>

Therefore, Member States and the Union should enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, as provided for in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, as well as maximise the co-benefits with other policies and legislation. The Commission should adopt a Union strategy on adaptation to climate change in line with the Paris Agreement. Member States should adopt comprehensive national adaptation strategies and plans based on robust climate change and vulnerability analyses, progress assessments and indicators, and guided by the best available and most recent scientific evidence. The Union should seek to create a favourable regulatory environment for national policies and measures put in place by Member States to adapt to climate change.

In order to allow for a timely preparation for the global stocktake referred to in Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, the conclusions of this assessment should be published by 30 September every five years, starting in 2023. This implies that the reports under Article 29(5) and Article 35 of that Regulation and, in the applicable years, the related reports under Article 29(1) and Article 32 of that Regulation should be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council at the same time as the conclusions of that assessment. In the event that the collective progress made by Member States towards the achievement of the climate-neutrality objective or on adaptation is insufficient or that Union measures are inconsistent with the climate-neutrality objective or inadequate to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience or reduce vulnerability, the Commission should take the necessary measures in accordance with the Treaties. The Commission should also regularly assess relevant national measures, and issue recommendations where it finds that a Member State’s measures are inconsistent with the climate-neutrality objective or inadequate to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.</p>
