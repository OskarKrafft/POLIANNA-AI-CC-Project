                           <p class="oj-normal">Directive 91/271/EEC sets the legal framework for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban wastewater and the discharge of biodegradable wastewater from certain industrial sectors. Urban wastewater can be formed by different mixtures of domestic wastewater, urban runoff and non-domestic wastewater from other origins. Wastewater from institutions such as offices, schools, kitchens with food preparation which originates predominantly from the human metabolism qualifies as domestic wastewater. The objective of Directive 91/271/EEC is to protect the environment from being adversely affected by insufficiently treated urban wastewater discharges. It has contributed to achieving the objectives established under Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc6-L_202403019EN.000101-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_202403019EN.000101-E0006"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">6</span>)</a> and other relevant Union law. This Directive should continue to pursue the same objective while also contributing to the protection of public health in accordance with the One Health approach, which is aimed at sustainably balancing and optimising the health of people, animals and ecosystems, when for instance urban wastewater is discharged into bathing waters or into water bodies used for the abstraction of drinking water, or when urban wastewater is used as an indicator for parameters relevant for public health. It should also ensure access to sanitation and to key information related to the governance of urban wastewater collection and treatment activities. This Directive should also aim at increasing synergies with climate change adaptation and actions to restore urban ecosystems in particular through integrated urban wastewater management planning, while making optimal use of digitalisation. Finally, this Directive should contribute to the progressive reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from urban wastewater collection and treatment activities, in particular by further reducing nitrogen emissions but also by promoting energy efficiency and production of renewable energies, and thus should contribute to the 2050 objective of Climate Neutrality established under Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_202403019EN.000101-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_202403019EN.000101-E0007"

In line with Article 193 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States can go beyond the minimum requirements set out in this Directive. Member States could consider for instance applying deadlines or thresholds more stringent than those included in this Directive, reaching energy or climate neutrality more rapidly or imposing additional requirements for, or broadening the spectrum of the application of, their national extended producer responsibility systems.</p>

It became apparent from that exercise that certain provisions of that Directive needed to be updated. Three important sources of pollution not fully addressed under that Directive from urban wastewater that could be avoided were identified, namely storm water overflows and polluted discharges of urban runoff, potentially malfunctioning individual systems, that is to say systems treating domestic wastewater that does not enter collecting systems, and small agglomerations that are currently not completely covered by Directive 91/271/EEC. Those three sources of pollution put significant pressure on surface water bodies in the Union. Moreover, the report of the evaluation also highlighted the need to improve the transparency and governance of urban wastewater activities, to seize the opportunity offered by the urban wastewater treatment sector to use its potential for renewable energy development and make tangible steps towards energy neutrality as a contribution to climate neutrality, and to harmonise urban wastewater surveillance of health parameters, such as the COVID-19 virus and its variants, as a means of supporting public health action.</p>

It is therefore necessary to take into account the specific situation of each Member State and, where appropriate, adapt the deadlines for the implementation of certain demanding requirements. For instance, Member States having a large number of small agglomerations concerned by the new requirements of this Directive in terms of collection and treatment of urban wastewater for agglomerations of between 1 000 and 2 000 p.e., should be allowed to extend the deadlines for compliance with those new requirements in their first national implementation programme. This should also be the case for Member States having a large number of facilities, for example above 50 %, that need to be upgraded to tertiary treatment in line with the new requirements of this Directive. Agglomerations of below 2 000 p.e. where collecting systems are already in place and discharging urban wastewater into treatment plants located in a different agglomeration should not be counted in the calculation of percentages for the purposes of the derogations from those deadlines. Moreover, the three Member States that acceded to the Union most recently, namely Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, had to make recent investments to implement the requirements of Directive 91/271/EEC. Furthermore, those Member States are characterised by high amounts of rural areas with a high outflux of population, in addition to an ageing rural population. It is therefore necessary to take into account the specific situation of those Member States by allowing them to extend the deadlines for compliance with those new requirements in their first national implementation programme.</p>

It is therefore appropriate to adapt the implementation deadlines in those specific cases. More specifically, where a Member State establishes that, due to the necessity to preserve cultural heritage, the construction of the required infrastructure is particularly difficult, it should be allowed to adapt the implementation deadlines in specific areas, and update accordingly its national implementation programme. The extensions of the deadlines should be set for each area and kept as short as possible, not exceeding 8 years. Cultural heritage should be understood within the meaning of Article 1 of the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention.</p>

Such overflows and runoff are expected to increase due to the combined effects of urbanisation and the progressive change of the rain regime linked with climate change. Urban wastewater management infrastructure is therefore particularly vulnerable to climate change. Solutions to reduce that source of pollution should be defined at local level, taking into account the specific local conditions. They should be based on an integrated quantitative and qualitative water management in urban areas. Therefore, Member States should ensure that integrated urban wastewater management plans are established at local level for all agglomerations of 100 000 p.e. and above as those agglomerations are responsible for a significant share of the pollution emitted. Furthermore, integrated urban wastewater management plans should also be put in place for agglomerations of between 10 000 p.e. and 100 000 p.e. where storm water overflows or urban runoff pose a risk for the environment or public health. In those plans, measures should be set out that aim at limiting the pollution from storm water overflows to no more than 2 % of the annual collected urban wastewater load calculated in dry weather flow conditions calculated on the basis of the pollutants in Tables 1 and 2 in Annex I.</p>

Those plans should also include measures to prevent pollution at source and favour nature-based solutions over those that would require the establishment of grey infrastructure. Those measures could include preventive temporary measures aimed at avoiding the entry of unpolluted rain waters into collecting systems or temporary storage, including natural water retention, and appropriate treatment of heavily loaded runoff or overflows resulting from first rains. Member States are encouraged to increase green and blue spaces in urban areas and to take into account the Urban Nature platform, which provides guidance and knowledge to support towns and cities. In order to ensure adequate coverage of the integrated urban wastewater management plans and a comprehensive solution to storm water problems, those plans should be established for drainage areas of the agglomerations concerned.</p>

Some of those micropollutants are hazardous for public health and the environment even in low concentrations, of micrograms per litre or below. While the primary, secondary and tertiary treatment already remove some micropollutants, an additional treatment, i.e. quaternary treatment, should be introduced in order to ensure that a large spectrum of the remaining micropollutants are removed from urban wastewater. Quaternary treatment should first focus on organic micropollutants, which represent a significant part of the pollution and for which removal technologies have already been designed. The quaternary treatment should be imposed on the basis of the precautionary principle, in combination with a risk-based approach. Therefore, all urban wastewater treatment plants of 150 000 p.e. and above should provide quaternary treatment, as those facilities represent a significant share of micropollutant discharges in the environment and the removal of micropollutants by urban wastewater treatment plants at such scale is cost-effective. For treatment plants of 150 000 p.e. and above, Member States should ensure the prioritisation of the required investments so that the facilities where the risks for the environment and human health are the highest are equipped without delay. For agglomerations of 10 000 p.e. and above, Member States should be required to apply quaternary treatment in areas identified as sensitive to pollution with micropollutants on the basis of clear criteria, which should be specified. Such areas should include locations where the discharge of treated urban wastewater to water bodies results in low dilution ratios, or where the receiving water bodies are used for the production of drinking water, for shellfish production or as bathing waters. Member States should be able not to apply quaternary treatment in those areas when a risk assessment shows that there is no potential danger from micropollutants to the environment or to human health. For all other types of water bodies in agglomerations of 10 000 p.e. and above, Member States should assess the risks that the discharge of micropollutants in urban wastewater poses for the environment or to public health on the basis of a standardised risk assessment and apply quaternary treatment only where needed according to the results of the risk assessment. Where there are several urban wastewater treatment plants in an agglomeration of 10 000 p.e. and above identified as sensitive to pollution with micropollutants, only those discharging into the area at risk should be required to apply quaternary treatment. In order to give Member States enough time to plan and deliver the necessary infrastructure, the requirement of quaternary treatment should progressively apply until 2045 with clear interim objectives.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The quaternary treatment necessary to remove micropollutants from urban wastewater will involve additional costs, such as costs related to monitoring and the cost of new advanced equipment to be installed in certain urban wastewater treatment plants. In order to cover those additional costs and in accordance with the polluter-pays principle expressed in Article 191(2) TFEU, it is essential that the producers placing on the Union market products containing substances which, at the end of their life, are found as micropollutants in urban wastewater take responsibility for the additional treatment required to remove those substances, generated in the context of their professional activities. A system of extended producer responsibility is the most appropriate means to achieve this, as it would limit the financial impact on the taxpayer and water tariffs, while providing an incentive to develop greener products. In this context, extended producer responsibility should apply regardless of whether the products are placed on the market, or whether their individual components were manufactured in a Member State or third country, or whether the producers have a registered office in the Union or the product is placed on the market via a digital platform. Pharmaceuticals and cosmetic residues currently represent the main sources of micropollutants found in urban wastewater requiring quaternary treatment. Therefore, extended producer responsibility should apply to those two product groups. On the basis of the results of the urban wastewater monitoring and the most recent scientific data, the Commission should regularly evaluate whether other products should be included in the extended producer responsibility system.</p>

Member States should, however, take into consideration the possible impacts of the application of the requirements of the extended producer responsibility on the accessibility, availability and affordability of products at national level, in particular medicines, placed on the Union market, as well as the possible impacts of the application of those requirements on the level playing field. Member States can take action to ensure sufficient funds are available, including by financing part of the costs for the quaternary treatment. Given that Member States might choose different implementation approaches, attention should be paid to the functioning of the internal market and, in any forthcoming evaluation of this Directive, the Commission should assess any potential impacts in this regard.</p>

This should be the case where the total amount of substances contained in products placed on the Union market by a producer amount to small quantities, i.e. less than 1 tonne per year, since the additional administrative burden for the producer would in such cases be disproportionate compared to the environmental benefits. Exemptions should also be possible for the part of the products for which the producer can demonstrate that no micropollutants are generated at the end of life of the product or where it can be proven that the residues from a product are rapidly biodegradable in wastewater and the environment or do not reach the urban wastewater treatment plants. The Commission should establish detailed criteria to identify the products placed on the Union market that do not generate micropollutants in urban wastewater at the end of their life, taking into account their hazardousness and their biodegradability. When developing those criteria, the Commission should take into account criteria already set in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc11-L_202403019EN.000101-E0011" href="#ntr11-L_202403019EN.000101-E0011"

In order to favour the substitution of substances and products generating micropollutants residues in urban wastewater, the contributions of the producers should be proportionate to the quantities of the substances contained in the products they place on the market and the hazardousness of those substances and their residues. The contributions should cover, but not exceed, the investment and operational costs for the monitoring activities for micropollutants, the collection, reporting and impartial verification of statistics on the quantities and hazardousness of products placed on the Member States market, and the application of the quaternary treatment to urban wastewater in an efficient manner. Those contributions should also cover operational costs of already established quaternary treatment at the date of entry into force of this Directive when it is necessary to meet the obligations of the extended producer responsibility system. It should also cover part of the investment costs of the established quaternary treatments, taking into account the depreciation of the investments and the deadlines of the financing obligations established in this Directive. Since urban wastewater is treated collectively, it is appropriate to introduce a requirement for producers to join a centralised organisation which can implement their obligations under the extended producer responsibility on their behalf.</p>

The evaluation also illustrated that, without clear legal obligations, only partial progress can be expected in that sector. In this context, Member States should be required to ensure that the total annual energy used by all urban wastewater treatment plants on their territory treating a load of 10 000 p.e. and above does not exceed the production of energy from renewable sources as defined in Article 2(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc12-L_202403019EN.000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_202403019EN.000101-E0012"

In order to take into account the specificities of each urban wastewater treatment plant, optimise the investments needed and provide for the required flexibility to reach the energy neutrality objective, while ensuring that the potential for renewable energy production and for energy savings is fully achieved, that objective should be met at national level and not for each treatment plant. All renewable energies produced by the urban wastewater treatment plants operators or their owners, whether on-site or off-site, such as hydraulic, solar, thermal, wind energy or biogas, should be taken into account. That objective should be progressively met with interim targets by 31 December 2045. It should be possible to purchase a limited amount of non-fossil energy, not directly linked to urban wastewater treatment activities, from external sources in 2040 and 2045, through the use of a derogation linked to conditions. Renewable energy generated by or on behalf of the owners or operators of the urban wastewater treatment plant should not comprise purchased renewable energy. Reaching that energy neutrality objective will contribute in particular to reducing the avoidable GHG emissions from the urban wastewater treatment sector, while supporting the achievement of the 2050 climate neutrality objectives and related national and Union objectives, such as the objectives set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc13-L_202403019EN.000101-E0013" href="#ntr13-L_202403019EN.000101-E0013"

Such non-domestic wastewater may come, for example, from industries, commercial establishments, or hospitals and other medical facilities. In most instances, there is a poor understanding and poor knowledge of such pollution, which can lead to a deterioration in the functioning of the treatment process and contribute to the pollution of the receiving waters, while also preventing the recovery of sludge and the reuse of treated wastewater. Member States should therefore regularly monitor and report on such non-domestic pollution that enters urban wastewater treatment plants and is discharged into water bodies. To prevent pollution from non-domestic wastewater discharges at source, releases from industries or enterprises connected to collecting systems should be subject to prior regulations or specific authorisation, or both, by the competent authority or appropriate body. In order to ensure that collecting systems and urban wastewater treatment plants are technically capable of receiving and treating the incoming pollution, the operators who manage urban wastewater treatment plants receiving non-domestic wastewater should be consulted and informed before those authorisations are issued or those prior regulations are adopted, and should be able to consult, on request, the issued authorisations in order to be able to adapt their treatment processes. Where non-domestic pollution is identified in the incoming waters, Member States should take appropriate measures to reduce pollution at source, by enhancing the monitoring of pollutants in collecting systems so that the pollution sources can be identified and, where necessary, by reviewing the authorisations provided to relevant, connected urban wastewater treatment plants.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The water resources of the Union are increasingly under pressure, resulting in permanent or temporary water scarcity in some areas of the Union. The Union’s ability to respond to the increasing pressures on water resources could be improved through a wider reuse of treated urban wastewater, limiting freshwater abstraction from surface and groundwater bodies. Therefore, the reuse of treated urban wastewater should be encouraged and applied whenever appropriate, especially in water-stressed areas, and for all appropriate purposes, while ensuring the minimum ecological flow of the receiving waters and taking into account the need to ensure that the objectives of good ecological and chemical status of the receiving bodies, as defined in Directive 2000/60/EC, are met. To achieve this, Member States should carry out monitoring of the impact of the reuse of treated urban wastewater on the minimum ecological flow of receiving waters in their assessment of impacts carried out under Directive 2000/60/EC. The potential for the reuse of treated urban wastewater should be assessed while taking into account the river basin management plans established under Directive 2000/60/EC and Member States’ decisions under Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/741 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc21-L_202403019EN.000101-E0021" href="#ntr21-L_202403019EN.000101-E0021"

The reinforcement of the requirements for the treatment of urban wastewater, and the actions to better monitor, track and reduce pollution at source, will have impacts on the quality of treated urban wastewater, and will therefore support water reuse. Where water reuse serves the purpose of agricultural irrigation, it should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/741. Where appropriate to ensure the safe reuse of treated urban wastewater, Member States should consider quaternary treatment for the urban wastewater that is reused or will be reused. Measures on promoting the reuse of treated urban wastewater and on such reuse itself should be considered in strategies on water resilience at Member State level, when such strategies are available.</p>

They should be safely managed, which means that they should be accessible to all, where appropriate, at all times, including for people with particular needs, such as children, older persons, persons with disabilities and homeless people, that they should be placed in a location that ensures maximum safety for users, and that they should be hygienically and technically safe to use.

The actions to better monitor and reduce pollution at source from non-domestic discharges will contribute to improving the quality of the sludge produced and ensure its safe use in agriculture. In order to ensure the proper and safe recovery of nutrients, including the critical substance phosphorus, from sludge, a minimum combined reuse and recycling rate should be set at Union level. Member States should be able to choose whether to reuse or recycle, or both, urban wastewater or sludge, or both, in order to recover phosphorus. The combined minimum reuse and recycling rate should take into account the phosphorus content of sludge, which can vary from one area to another. It should also take into account the level of saturation of each national market, for example the availability of other sources of phosphorus from organic sources, for instance from livestock farming, and the possibilities of its absorption in agriculture. Member States should be encouraged to monitor micropollutants in sludge, particularly where there is a risk of accumulation of micropollutants in sludge, and when it is reused in agriculture in order to increase knowledge about its presence and to protect the environment and human health. The proper and safe recovery of nutrients and their reuse in agriculture should be encouraged in order to support the resilience and sustainability of the agricultural sector and contribute to the strategic autonomy of the Union fertiliser industry. In that context, Member States should, while taking into account national and local valorisation options, take measures to encourage the production and purchasing of recovered nutrients from urban wastewater and sludge. When reusing sludge in agriculture particular attention should be paid to microplastics. Microplastics should therefore be systematically monitored when sludge is reused in agriculture. This information is indispensable for the safe management of sludge in agriculture and any possible review of relevant Union policy.</p>

Monitoring should be supported, where technically feasible and appropriate, through the use of digital tools. In particular for the operational management of collecting systems and urban wastewater treatment plants, the use of digital tools should be systematically considered. To verify the compliance of the quaternary treatment concerning the reduction of micropollutants in urban wastewater discharges, it is sufficient to monitor a limited set of representative micropollutants. The monitoring frequencies should be built on the current best practices, as currently practised in Switzerland. To remain cost-effective, those obligations should be adapted to the size of the urban wastewater treatment plants and of the agglomerations. For the purposes of such monitoring, this Directive provides for sampling to be carried out. Each time sampling is carried out, a sample is taken both at the inlet and outlet of the urban wastewater treatment plant. The monitoring will also contribute to providing data for the overall Environmental Monitoring Framework as set up under the 8th Environmental Action Programme <a id="ntc26-L_202403019EN.000101-E0026" href="#ntr26-L_202403019EN.000101-E0026"

To avoid an unnecessary burden, only pollutants that can be expected to be found in urban wastewater should be monitored, taking into account the high variety of pollutants which could reach urban wastewater treatment plants, including from non-domestic wastewater sources. Member States should be able to reduce the monitoring frequency if pollutants are not found in subsequent sampling campaigns. More specifically, recent data shows that PFAS are found in urban wastewater, sometimes at high concentrations. The most recent scientific evidence shows that PFAS are a concern for the environment and for public health due to their persistence. It is therefore essential to better understand the pathways of PFAS into the environment and to monitor them in the inlet and outlet of the urban wastewater treatment plants. This monitoring should start in the first instance where the discharges reach catchment areas used for the abstraction of drinking water, due to the high risks of being exposed to PFAS and their impact on health.</p>

It should be replaced by a requirement for Member States to improve, with the support of the EEA, the existing national standardised data sets established under Directive 91/271/EEC, and to regularly update them. The Commission will use those improved data sets to verify compliance with this Directive. It is appropriate for the reporting model to be developed by the EEA in collaboration with Member States. Access to the national databases should be provided to the Commission and the EEA. In order to ensure complete information on the application of this Directive, the data sets should include information on compliance of urban wastewater treatment plants with the treatment requirements (pass/fail, loads and concentration of pollutants discharged), on the level of achievement of the objectives of energy neutrality, on GHG emissions of the treatment plants above 10 000 p.e. and on measures taken by the Member States in the context of storm water overflows and urban runoff, access to sanitation and treatment by individual systems.

In the future, the extended producer responsibility should be such as to ensure that the costs of the quaternary treatment are at least partially borne by the industries concerned and complemented by other types of financing. In the past, the implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC was also substantially supported by the Union’s Cohesion Policy and programmes under Horizon 2020 and LIFE. In order to ensure the timely and proper implementation of this Directive, it is essential that Member States establish a national implementation programme including long-term programming of the required investments accompanied by a financing strategy. Those national implementation programmes should be reported to the Commission. To limit the administrative burden, that requirement should not apply to Member States in which more than 95 % of the agglomerations are compliant with the main obligations to treat and collect wastewater. To continue the implementation of this Directive, the Commission should consider the national implementation programmes reported by Member States for the preparation of the next multiannual financial framework and those following thereafter and the Member States should put in place the required extended producer responsibility system without delay.</p>
