The parallel development of market practices based on commercially driven priorities that produce divergent results may cause market fragmentation, and risks further exacerbating inefficiencies in the functioning of the internal market. Divergent standards and market practices make it difficult to compare different bonds, create uneven market conditions for issuers, cause additional barriers within the internal market and increase the risks of greenwashing and distorting investment decisions.</p>

Specifying quality requirements for European Green Bonds in the form of a regulation should ensure that there are uniform conditions for the issuance of such bonds by preventing diverging national requirements that could result from the transposition of a directive, and should also ensure that those conditions are directly applicable to issuers of such bonds. Issuers that wish to use the designation ‘European Green Bond’ or ‘EuGB’ should follow the same rules across the Union in order to increase market efficiency by reducing discrepancies and thereby also reducing the costs for investors of assessing such bonds.

                           <p class="oj-normal">The proceeds of European Green Bonds should be used to finance economic activities that have a lasting positive impact on the environment. Such lasting positive impact can be attained in several ways. Since fixed assets are typically long-term assets, a first way is to use the proceeds of European Green Bonds to finance fixed tangible or fixed intangible assets that are not financial assets, provided that those fixed assets relate to economic activities that meet the taxonomy requirements. Since financial assets can also be used to finance economic activities with a lasting positive impact on the environment, a second way is to use the proceeds of European Green Bonds to finance financial assets, provided that the proceeds of those financial assets are directly, or indirectly through subsequent financial assets, allocated to economic activities that meet the taxonomy requirements. It should be possible to allocate those financial assets to a maximum of three subsequent financial assets in succession and issuers should ensure that it is possible for external reviewers to review effectively the final allocation of proceeds. Since the assets of households can also have a lasting positive impact on the environment, a third way is to use the proceeds of European Green Bonds to finance the assets and expenditure of households. Moreover, since capital expenditure and selected operating expenditure can be used to acquire, upgrade or maintain fixed assets, a fourth way is to use the proceeds of European Green Bonds to finance capital and operating expenditure that relate to economic activities that meet the taxonomy requirements or that will meet those requirements within a reasonably short period from the issuance of the bond concerned, provided that the issuer has published a plan to expand economic activities that are aligned with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (‘taxonomy-aligned’) or to allow economic activities to become taxonomy-aligned in accordance with Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 <a id="ntc8-L_202302631EN.000101-E0008" href="#ntr8-L_202302631EN.000101-E0008"

Those undertakings should then demonstrate in annual allocation reports that the related environmentally sustainable assets meet the applicable technical screening criteria. In order to ensure that all proceeds of European Green Bonds are allocated to environmentally sustainable economic activities, the undertakings should also demonstrate that the value of those environmentally sustainable assets exceeds or equals the value of European Green Bonds that have not yet matured. When issuers use the portfolio approach, the requirement that bond proceeds are to be allocated only to financial assets that are created earlier than five years after the bond issuance should not apply. To ensure that the information provided remains complete and up to date, an external reviewer should review the annual allocation reports each year, except in cases where no change in allocation is made in the portfolio of assets.

It is therefore logical that the technical screening criteria established by delegated acts adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 should determine which fixed assets, expenditure and financial assets may be financed with the proceeds of European Green Bonds. In view of the expected technological progress in the field of environmental sustainability, those technical screening criteria are likely to be reviewed and amended over time. Regardless of such changes, in order to provide legal certainty to issuers and investors and prevent amendments to the technical screening criteria from having a negative impact on the price of European Green Bonds that have already been issued, issuers should be able to apply those technical screening criteria that are applicable at the moment of issuance of the relevant European Green Bond when allocating the proceeds of that bond to eligible fixed assets or expenditure. Where the applicable technical screening criteria are amended, the issuer should ensure that unallocated proceeds and proceeds covered by a CapEx plan that have not yet met the taxonomy requirements meet the amended technical screening criteria within seven years. If the issuer considers that an economic activity funded by bond proceeds is at risk of not meeting the amended technical screening criteria within seven years, the issuer should be allowed to publish a plan on how to align the economic activity to the amended technical screening criteria and to mitigate the negative consequences, to the extent possible. That plan should be published before the end of the seven-year period that starts from the amendment of the technical screening criteria and be reviewed by an external reviewer. Under the portfolio approach, issuers should include in their portfolio of fixed assets or financial assets only assets that are aligned with any technical screening criteria applicable at any point during the seven years prior to the publication of the relevant allocation report. Thus, if any asset financed by a European Green Bond is not aligned with the amended technical screening criteria, it should be able to continue to be part of the pool of financed assets for up to seven years.</p>

In particular, the lack of a common methodology for issuers to report on the alignment of bond proceeds with the taxonomy requirements creates administrative difficulties and uncertainty for bond investors that report pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc11-L_202302631EN.000101-E0011" href="#ntr11-L_202302631EN.000101-E0011"

Therefore, public disclosure templates should be established, which issuers of such bonds can choose to complete and publish alongside their other disclosure documentation. Such templates should contain information on the allocation of bond proceeds to taxonomy-aligned activities, while clearly identifying the share of proceeds allocated to gas and nuclear energy. The templates should be developed by the Commission by means of guidelines for voluntary pre-issuance disclosures, which can serve as inspiration for any future sustainability-related disclosures under Union law, and a delegated act for periodic disclosures. Such disclosures should be consistent with the relevant sections of the European Green Bond factsheet and allocation report.</p>

In turn, the originator is the entity that uses the bond proceeds to allocate financing to economic activities. A European Green Bond securitisation market where all of the underlying exposures are taxonomy aligned would face considerable growth constraints at present, with a scarcity of taxonomy-aligned assets fit for securitisation. Therefore, in its report on ‘Developing a Framework for Sustainable Securitisation’, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc13-L_202302631EN.000101-E0013" href="#ntr13-L_202302631EN.000101-E0013"

That approach would be appropriate until such time as an adequate volume of taxonomy-aligned assets is generated in the Union economy. To ensure enforceability, the responsibility of the originator with respect to the future use of proceeds should be clearly stated in the prospectus published pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.</p>

However, the exclusion requirements should take into account the predominant purpose of the securitised exposures and should not capture exposures where the link with fossil fuel activities is only marginal or incidental, such as a commercial building with a gas storage tank. In addition, the exclusion requirements should not be based solely on the use of fossil fuels, such as in the case of car loans or residential loans. Furthermore, the originator should disclose information about taxonomy eligibility, taxonomy alignment and compliance with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ in respect of the activities financed by the securitised exposures. Such disclosure should be on a best efforts basis and to the best of the originator’s ability, using available data such as data gathered in the originator’s internal database or IT system. Originators are invited to make that information available also via the securitisation repositories registered with the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc15-L_202302631EN.000101-E0015" href="#ntr15-L_202302631EN.000101-E0015"

In light of the experience that those competent authorities have obtained while reviewing securitisation transactions, it is appropriate that they supervise the compliance of originators with the requirements of this Regulation. However, given that both originators and SSPEs are involved in a securitisation, both the competent authorities of the originator and of the SSPE should be entrusted with the corresponding supervisory powers laid down in this Regulation, and should cooperate to ensure effective and adequate supervision.</p>

Information about European Green Bonds will be of value to investors and other financial market participants as well as to the general public. Therefore, the disclosure documents referred to in this Regulation, including the European Green Bond factsheet, allocation report and impact report, the CapEx plan, where applicable, and optional disclosure templates for bonds marketed as environmentally sustainable and for sustainability-linked bonds, as well as the reviews carried out by external reviewers, should be publicly and freely available.
