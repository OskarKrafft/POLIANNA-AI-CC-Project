Moreover, the EU Hydrogen Strategy stresses that moving towards a liquid market with commodity-based hydrogen trading would facilitate entry of new producers and be beneficial for deeper integration with other energy carriers and would create viable price signals for investment decisions and operational decisions. The rules laid down in this Directive should thus facilitate the emergence of markets for hydrogen, commodity-based hydrogen trading and liquid trading hubs. Any undue barriers in that regard should be eliminated by Member States. While recognising the inherent differences, existing rules that enabled efficient commercial operations and trading developed for the markets for electricity and natural gas should also be considered for a market for hydrogen.

                           <p class="oj-normal">In line with the EU Hydrogen Strategy, the priority for the Union is to develop renewable hydrogen produced using mainly wind and solar energy. Renewable hydrogen produced using biomass energy falls under the definition of biogas, as defined in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Renewable hydrogen is the most compatible with the Union’s climate-neutrality objective and zero-pollution goal in the long term and the most coherent with an integrated energy system. However, renewable hydrogen production is not likely to be scaled up fast enough to meet the expected growth in demand for hydrogen in the Union. Therefore, low-carbon fuels such as low-carbon hydrogen may play a role in the energy transition in line with the Union’s climate targets, particularly in the short and medium term, to rapidly reduce emissions of existing fuels and to support the transition of the Union’s customers in hard-to-decarbonise sectors in which more energy or cost-efficient options are not available. In order to support the transition, it is necessary to establish a threshold for greenhouse gas emission reductions for low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic gaseous fuels. Such threshold should become more stringent for hydrogen produced in installations starting operations from 1 January 2031 to take into account technological developments and better stimulate the dynamic progress towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from hydrogen production.</p>

The certification of low-carbon fuels should be effected in a manner that is coherent with the certification of renewable fuels. It is therefore appropriate to refer to the provisions set out for the certification of renewable fuels in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and apply them by analogy for certification of low-carbon fuels. In order to ensure that low-carbon fuels have the same decarbonisation impact as compared to renewable alternatives, it is important that they are certified by applying a similar methodological approach based on a life-cycle assessment of their total greenhouse gas emissions. Such a life-cycle assessment should take into account emissions arising from the production of low-carbon fuels over the whole supply chain, including emissions arising from the extraction of the primary energy, processing and transport, and should take into account indirect emissions resulting from the diversion of rigid inputs and actual carbon capture rates. Upstream emissions of methane should be derived building on the measures included in Regulation (EU) 2024/1787 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc20-L_202401788EN.000101-E0020" href="#ntr20-L_202401788EN.000101-E0020"

Their leakage from the natural gas and hydrogen system should thus be avoided in line with the energy efficiency first principle and in order to minimise their climate impact. Natural gas transmission, distribution, underground storage and liquefied natural gas terminals need to comply with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/1787. That Regulation lays down rules for the accurate measurement, quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of methane emissions in the energy sector in the Union, as well as for the abatement of those emissions, including through leak detection and repair surveys, repair obligations and restrictions on venting and flaring. Moreover, this Directive should provide for hydrogen network, storage and terminal operators to take measures to prevent and minimise hydrogen emissions in their operations and carry out, at regular intervals, a hydrogen leak detection and repair survey of all relevant components under the operator responsibility. Where appropriate, the Commission should report on the environmental and climate risks of hydrogen leakage and, where appropriate, submit proposals for measures including maximum hydrogen leakage rates to minimise possible risks of hydrogen leakage. Where such measures are adopted, they should be considered in the methodology for assessing greenhouse gas emissions savings from low-carbon fuels.</p>

Existing rights of consumers and rights for access to essential services, including energy, and tackling energy poverty, as stated in the communication of the Commission of 26 April 2017 establishing a European Pillar of Social Rights, proclaimed and signed on 17 November 2017 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Gothenburg Social Summit, need to be strengthened and guaranteed, and should include greater transparency. In that respect, cross-subsidisation of hydrogen networks through natural gas or electricity network tariffs should be avoided. Consumer protection should ensure that all consumers in the wider remit of the Union benefit from a competitive market for natural gas. Consumer rights should be enforced by Member States or, where Member States have so provided, the regulatory authorities.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Member States should have a wide discretion to impose public service obligations on natural gas undertakings in pursuing objectives of general economic interest without hampering the transition to an integrated, highly energy efficient and renewables-based energy system in accordance with the relevant Union targets, law and strategies. However, public service obligations in the form of price setting for the supply of natural gas constitute a fundamentally distortive measure that often leads to the accumulation of tariff deficits, the limitation of consumer choice, poorer incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments, lower standards of service, lower levels of consumer engagement and satisfaction, and the restriction of competition, as well as to there being fewer innovative products and services on the market. Consequently, Member States should apply other policy tools, in particular targeted social policy measures, to safeguard the affordability of natural gas supply to their citizens. Public interventions in price setting for the supply of natural gas would constitute, in principle, a market-distortive measure. Such interventions should therefore be carried out only where appropriate and as public service obligations and should be subject to specific conditions. A fully liberalised, properly functioning retail market for natural gas would stimulate price and non-price competition among existing suppliers and provide incentives to new entrants on the market, thereby improving consumer choice and satisfaction. Under this Directive, regulated prices, including below cost, should be possible for customers affected by energy poverty, vulnerable household customers and, in specific cases, household customers and microenterprises. During a natural gas price crisis, when wholesale and retail natural gas prices increase significantly, Member States should be allowed to extend the application of regulated prices temporarily to essential social services as defined in Article 2, point (4), of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc21-L_202401788EN.000101-E0021" href="#ntr21-L_202401788EN.000101-E0021"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">21</span>)</a>, and to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As regards household customers, essential social services and SMEs, Member States should, exceptionally and temporarily, be allowed to set regulated prices below cost during a natural gas price crisis provided that this does not create distortions between suppliers and that suppliers are compensated for the costs of supplying below cost. However, it is necessary to ensure that such price regulation is targeted and does not create incentives to increase consumption. Therefore, such exceptional and temporary extension of price regulation should be limited to 80 % of median household consumption for household customers, and to 70 % of the previous year’s consumption for essential social services and SMEs. The Council should be able, acting on a proposal from the Commission, by means of an implementing decision, to declare a regional or Union-wide natural gas price crisis. The assessment of whether such a natural gas price crisis exists should be based on a comparison with prices in times of normal market operation and therefore should exclude the impact of previous natural gas price crises declared pursuant to this Directive. Such implementing decision should also specify the period of validity of the declaration of a natural gas price crisis, during which the temporary extension of regulated prices applies. That period should not be longer than one year. Where the conditions for that natural gas price crisis declaration continue to be fulfilled, it should be possible for the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, to extend the period of validity of the implementing decision. The conferral of implementing powers on the Council is justified given the significant horizontal implications for Member States of a decision declaring a natural gas price crisis and thereby to trigger the extended possibilities for public interventions in price setting for the supply of natural gas. Such implications are significant in terms both of the number of customers concerned and of the importance of the categories of such customers. The conferral of implementing powers on the Council also adequately takes into account the political nature of such a decision declaring a natural gas price crisis, which requires a delicate balancing of different policy considerations central to Member States’ decision to implement price-setting for energy. In any event, the declaration of a regional or Union-wide natural gas price crisis should ensure a level playing field across all Member States affected by the decision so that the internal market is not unduly distorted.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Public service obligations in the form of price setting for the supply of natural gas should be used without overriding the principle of open markets in clearly defined circumstances and for clearly defined beneficiaries and should be limited in duration. Such circumstances might occur where supply is severely constrained, causing significantly higher natural gas prices than normal, or in the event of a market failure where interventions by regulatory authorities and competition authorities have proven to be ineffective. Such circumstances would disproportionately affect household customers and, in particular, vulnerable customers who typically expend a higher share of their disposable income on energy bills compared to high-income consumers. In order to mitigate the distortive effects of public service obligations in price setting for the supply of natural gas, Member States applying such interventions should put in place additional measures, including measures to prevent distortions of price setting in the wholesale market or measures to support energy efficiency, in particular for vulnerable customers and customers affected by energy poverty. Member States should ensure that all beneficiaries of regulated prices are able to benefit fully from the offers available on the competitive market when they choose to do so. To that end, they should be directly and regularly informed of the offers and savings available on the competitive market and should be provided with assistance to respond to and benefit from market-based offers.</p>

In accordance with that principle, price systems must not explicitly make certain categories of customer bear the cost of price interventions that affect other categories of customer. Public service obligations in price setting should only concern the supply of natural gas, as household customers are not expected to use hydrogen for heating purposes on a wide scale. The market for hydrogen is expected to concern mostly industry, which does not require such public interventions.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The switch from fossil gas to renewable alternatives is expected to be realised if energy from renewable sources becomes an attractive, non-discriminatory choice for consumers based on truly transparent information where the transition costs are fairly distributed among different groups of consumers and market participants. However, switching from natural gas to other technologies is usually not easy due to the lock-in effect related to the underpinning equipment. Where natural gas infrastructure is decommissioned, it should be accompanied by measures that address the adverse effects on final customers, in particular vulnerable customers and household customers affected by energy poverty, as well as measures that address inequalities resulting from the energy transition. Natural gas consumers should be protected from rising tariffs when natural gas assets have to be depreciated, from cross subsidisation between gas and hydrogen users and from rising natural gas tariffs resulting from a shrinking customer base.</p>

Energy bills remain the most common consumer concern and source of consumer complaints, a factor that contributes to the persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement in the natural gas sector. Provisions for billing information in the gas sector also lag behind rights granted to consumers in the electricity sector. It is therefore necessary to align them and to set minimum requirements for bills and billing information in the gas sector, so that consumers have access to transparent, complete and easy to understand information. Bills should convey information to the final customers on their consumption and costs, on carbon dioxide emissions, and on the share of renewable gas and low-carbon gas, thus facilitating comparison between offers when switching supplier or energy source, as well as information on their consumer rights, such as on alternative dispute resolution. In addition, bills should be a tool to actively engage consumers in the market, so that consumers can manage their consumption patterns and make greener choices. It is important to provide comprehensive and accurate information to consumers to ensure they are aware of their environmental impact and can therefore express their preference for the most sustainable energy carriers. Directive (EU) 2023/1791 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>

Consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consumption. Prepayments should not place a disproportionate disadvantage on their users, while different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. Information on energy costs provided to consumers frequently enough should create incentives for energy savings because it will give customers direct feedback on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and change of behaviour.</p>

Such assessments should be reviewed regularly in response to significant changes in the underlying assumptions and in any event at least every four years, given the fast pace of technological developments.

Member States should be requested to report on progress made. Grandfathering of authorisations, such as licences, permissions, concessions or approvals, granted under national law for the construction and operation of existing natural gas pipelines and other network assets is needed once the transported gaseous energy carrier in a natural gas pipeline changes from natural gas to (pure) hydrogen. That grandfathering of authorisations should not affect the validity of technical safety requirements for hydrogen infrastructure, nor the possibility for competent authorities to monitor compliance with such requirements and to take appropriate and proportionate enforcement measures, including a possible revocation of the grandfathered authorisations, if justified. This should prevent undue delay in repurposing existing natural gas pipelines and other networks assets for hydrogen transport. It should be avoided that conditions for granting authorisations for hydrogen system infrastructure are materially different unless sufficiently justified. Technical safety considerations might justify a differentiated approach in grandfathering existing or issuing new authorisations. The provisions on authorisation procedures should apply without prejudice to international and Union law, including provisions to protect the environment and human health. Where duly justified on the grounds of extraordinary circumstances, it should be possible to extend the time limits for authorisation procedures by up to one year.</p>

The availability for applicants to submit relevant documents in digital form and the availability of a manual of procedures for applicants could contribute to efficiency. Member States should ensure that the authorities implementing authorisation procedures are actively involved in the tackling of remaining barriers, including non-financial ones such as insufficient knowledge, digital and human resources that hinder their processing of a growing number of authorisation procedures. Permitting procedures for the connections to the transmission or distribution network should not be hampered by a lack of administrative capacity. Furthermore, such permitting procedures should not establish hurdles in relation to the achievement of the national renewable energy target.</p>

Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production interests, is clearly an effective and stable manner to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for the internal markets for gas and electricity referred to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most effective tool to promote investments in infrastructure in a non-discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person is not entitled to exercise control over a production or supply undertaking and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system or transmission system operator should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a production or supply undertaking. Within those limits, a production or supply undertaking should be able to have a minority shareholding in a transmission system operator or transmission system.</p>

To ensure that network activities and supply and production activities throughout the Union remain independent from each other, regulatory authorities should be empowered to refuse certification to transmission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. To ensure the consistent application of those rules across the Union, the regulatory authorities should take utmost account of the Commission’s opinion when the former take decisions on certification. To ensure, in addition, respect for the international obligations of the Union and solidarity and energy security within the Union, the Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person from a third country. In making that assessment, the Commission should take into account commercial relationships that could negatively affect the incentives and ability of the operator to perform its tasks, as well as the international obligations of the Union and any other specific facts and circumstances of the case. Such facts and circumstances should include the weaponised reductions of natural gas supplies and manipulation of the markets through intentional disruptions of natural gas flows with the clear potential of a direct and serious impact on the essential international security interests of the Union and Member States.</p>

It is important to provide a clear regulatory framework allowing for the refusal of access and the possible disconnection of network users to attain those policy objectives. It should be possible to refuse access to or disconnect network users in relation to infrastructure that will be decommissioned in line with the network development plan at transmission level or where decommissioning is provided for at distribution level. At the same time, adequate measures should be undertaken to protect network users in such circumstances and it is also important that the refusal of access and disconnection decisions are subject to objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria developed by regulatory authorities.</p>

It is also important that hydrogen quality standards provide further criteria to determine the commonly acceptable hydrogen purity levels. It is necessary for a bandwidth of acceptable hydrogen purity levels and other relevant hydrogen quality parameters, for example contaminants, to be defined by means of a technical standardisation process by European standardisation bodies.</p>

Natural gas can reach the citizens of the Union only through the network. Functioning open markets for natural gas and, in particular, networks and other assets associated with natural gas supply are essential for public security, for the competitiveness of the economy and for the well-being of the citizens of the Union. Persons from third countries should therefore only be allowed to control a transmission system or a transmission system operator if they comply with the requirements of effective separation that apply inside the Union. Without prejudice to the international obligations of the Union, the Union considers that the natural gas transmission system sector is of high importance to the Union and therefore additional safeguards are necessary regarding the preservation of the security of supply of energy to the Union to avoid any threats to public order and public security in the Union and the welfare of the citizens of the Union. The security of supply of energy to the Union requires, in particular, an assessment of the independence of network operation, the level of the Union’s and individual Member States’ dependence on energy supply from third countries, and the treatment of both domestic and foreign trade and investment in energy in a particular third country. Security of supply should therefore be assessed in the light of the factual circumstances of each case as well as the rights and obligations arising under international law, in particular the international agreements between the Union and the third country concerned. Where appropriate the Commission should submit recommendations to negotiate relevant agreements with third countries addressing the security of supply of energy to the Union or to include the necessary issues in other negotiations with those third countries.</p>

It is therefore appropriate that natural gas storage facilities are operated through legally separate entities that have effective decision-making rights with respect to assets necessary to maintain, operate and develop natural gas storage facilities. It is also necessary to increase transparency in respect of the natural gas storage capacity that is offered to third parties, by obliging Member States to establish and publish a non-discriminatory, clear framework that determines the appropriate regulatory regime applicable to natural gas storage facilities. That obligation should not require a new decision on access regimes but should improve the transparency regarding the access regime to natural gas storage. Confidentiality requirements for commercially sensitive information are particularly important where data of a strategic nature are concerned or where there is only a single user of a natural gas storage facility.</p>

For an optimised planning across energy carriers and to bridge the gap between the diverse national and Union-wide network planning approaches, additional requirements for consistent planning should be introduced. To ensure a cost-effective infrastructure rollout and to avoid stranded assets, the network planning should also take account of the increased interlinkages between natural gas and electricity, as well as hydrogen and, where applicable, district heating. Apart from power-to-natural gas assets, interlinkages between hydrogen and electricity may include as well hydrogen power plants. The network planning should be transparent and allow the relevant stakeholders to participate. To that end, the operators should be required to conduct an extensive stakeholder consultation.

Natural gas distribution system operators should be required to develop network decommissioning plans when a reduction in natural gas demand is expected that requires the decommissioning of natural gas distribution systems or parts of such systems. Natural gas distribution system operators and hydrogen distribution network operators can be allowed to develop joint plans if operating in the same area and parts of the network are to be repurposed. Those plans should be in line with the ten-year network development plans. The distribution network development plans and the decommissioning plans for natural gas should promote the energy efficiency and energy system integration taking into account the local heating and cooling plans. Those plans should contribute to the achievement of the Union’s energy and climate targets and be based on reasonable assumptions about demand and production of natural gas and hydrogen. When preparing the plan, the operators should be required to conduct a consultation process involving the relevant stakeholders and make the draft plans publicly available. Member States should ensure guidance from the regulatory authorities where parts of the distribution system might require decommissioning, in particular before the end of their originally projected depreciation time.</p>

Market integration may be an opportunity to make best use of infrastructure provided it does not negatively impact neighbouring markets, for instance by increased cross-border tariffs. It is also a chance to increase competition, liquidity and trade to the benefit of the end-consumers in the region, by attracting suppliers which otherwise would not come due to the small market size. Market integration allows also to create bigger zones accessing more supply sources. Such diversification could have an impact on the wholesale market prices, thanks to improved competition between sources, but may also improve security of supply if there is no remaining internal congestion in the new merged zone. Market integration could be a basis to further support the transformation of the market for natural gas, including the deployment of renewable gas and low-carbon gas. Member States, regulatory authorities and transmission system operators should cooperate to facilitate regional integration.</p>
