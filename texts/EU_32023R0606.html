Moreover, there appears to be a lack of awareness and financial literacy, as well as, most importantly, low levels of trust and reliability as regards the finance industry, that need to be overcome in order to make ELTIFs more accessible and popular among retail investors. It is therefore necessary to review the functioning of the legal framework for the operation of ELTIFs in order to ensure that more investments are channelled to businesses in need of capital and to long-term investment projects.</p>

As a result, it can occur that a majority of ELTIF assets and investments, or the main revenue or profit generation of such assets and investments, is located within the Union. However, long-term investments in projects, undertakings, and infrastructure projects in third countries can also bring capital to ELTIFs and benefit the Union’s economy. Such benefits can originate in multiple ways, including through investments that promote the development of border regions, that enhance commercial, financial and technological cooperation and that facilitate investments in environmental and sustainable energy projects. Indeed, certain long-term assets and investments that benefit the Union’s real economy will unavoidably be located in third countries, such as subsea fibre optic cables that connect Europe with other continents, the construction of liquefied natural gas terminals and related infrastructure, or cross-border investments in renewable energy installations and facilities that contribute to the resilience of the electrical grid and the energy security of the Union. Since investments in third-country qualifying portfolio undertakings and eligible assets can bring benefits to investors and managers of ELTIFs, as well as to the economies, infrastructure, climate and environmental sustainability and citizens of such third countries, Regulation (EU) 2015/760 should not prevent a majority of ELTIF assets and investments, or the main revenue or profit generation of such assets and investments, from being located in a third country.</p>

At present, Regulation (EU) 2015/760 requires that investments in equity or quasi-equity instruments of qualifying portfolio undertakings only take place where those undertakings are majority-owned subsidiaries, which substantially limits the scope of the eligible asset base. ELTIFs should therefore, in general, have the possibility of conducting minority co-investment in investment opportunities. That possibility should give ELTIFs additional flexibility in implementing their investment strategies, attract more promotors of investment projects and increase the range of possible eligible target assets, all of which are essential for the implementation of indirect investment strategies.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Due to concerns that fund-of-funds strategies can give rise to investments that would not fall within the scope of eligible investment assets, Regulation (EU) 2015/760 at present contains restrictions on investments in other funds throughout the life of an ELTIF. Fund-of-funds strategies are, however, a common and very effective way of obtaining rapid exposure to illiquid assets, in particular in respect of real estate and in the context of fully paid-in capital structures. It is therefore necessary to give ELTIFs the possibility of investing in other funds, to enable them to ensure a faster deployment of capital. Facilitating fund-of-funds investments by ELTIFs would also allow reinvestment of excess cash into funds, as different investments with distinct maturities might lower the cash drag of an ELTIF. It is therefore necessary to expand the eligibility of fund-of-funds strategies for managers of ELTIFs beyond investments in European venture capital funds (EuVECAs) or European social entrepreneurship funds (EuSEFs). The categories of collective investment undertakings in which ELTIFs can invest should thus be broadened to include undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and also EU alternative investment funds (EU AIFs) managed by EU AIF managers (EU AIFMs). However, in order to ensure effective investor protection, it is also necessary to provide that where an ELTIF invests in other ELTIFs, in EuVECAs, in EuSEFs, in UCITS or EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs, those collective investment undertakings should also invest in eligible investments and have not themselves invested more than 10 % of their capital in any other collective investment undertaking. In order to prevent circumvention of those rules and to ensure that ELTIFs comply on an aggregate portfolio basis with Regulation (EU) 2015/760, the assets and cash borrowing position of ELTIFs should be combined with those of the collective investment undertakings in which ELTIFs have invested in order to assess ELTIFs’ compliance with the portfolio composition and diversification requirements, and with the borrowing limits.</p>

The requirement for a minimum value of individual real assets should therefore be removed.

However, innovative recently authorised financial undertakings such as FinTechs could play an important role in promoting digital innovation, the overall efficiency of Union financial markets and job creation, and in contributing to the resilience and stability of Union financial infrastructure and the capital markets union. Such financial undertakings design, develop or offer innovative products or technologies that aim to automate or improve existing business models, processes, applications and products, or result in new ones, and thereby benefit Union financial markets, financial institutions and the provision of financial services to financial institutions, businesses or consumers. Such financial undertakings also render specific regulatory, supervisory or oversight processes more efficient and effective, or modernise regulatory, supervisory or oversight compliance functions across financial or non-financial institutions. It is therefore desirable to amend Regulation (EU) 2015/760 in order to permit ELTIFs to invest in innovative recently authorised financial undertakings. As the area is dynamic and rapidly evolving, ELTIFs should be allowed to invest in financial undertakings, other than financial holding companies or mixed-activity holding companies, that are regulated entities authorised or registered more recently than five years before the date of the initial investment.</p>

However, many listed companies with a low market capitalisation have a limited liquidity which prevents managers of ELTIFs from building, within a reasonable time, a sufficient position in such listed companies, and as a result narrows the range of available investment targets. In order to provide ELTIFs with a better liquidity profile, the market capitalisation of the listed qualifying portfolio undertakings in which ELTIFs can invest should therefore be increased from a maximum of EUR 500 000 000 to a maximum of EUR 1 500 000 000. To avoid potential changes to the eligibility of such investments due to currency fluctuations or other factors, the determination of the market capitalisation threshold should be made only at the time of the initial investment.</p>

To avoid such conflicts of interest, and to ensure sound corporate governance, Regulation (EU) 2015/760 requires that an ELTIF only invests in assets that are unrelated to the manager of the ELTIF, unless the ELTIF invests in units or shares of other collective investment undertakings that are managed by the manager of the ELTIF. It is, however, established market practice that one or several investment vehicles of the asset manager co-invest alongside another fund that has a similar objective and strategy as that of the ELTIF. Such co-investments by the EU AIFM and other affiliate entities that belong to the same group allow for the attraction of larger pools of capital for investments in large-scale projects. For that purpose, asset managers typically invest in parallel with the ELTIF in a target entity and structure their investments through co-investment vehicles. As part of the asset management mandate, portfolio managers and senior staff of the asset managers are typically required or expected to co-invest in the same fund that they manage. It is therefore appropriate to specify that the provisions on conflicts of interest should not prevent a manager of an ELTIF or an undertaking that belongs to the same group from co-investing in that ELTIF or from co-investing with that ELTIF in the same asset.

However, professional and retail investors have different time horizons, risk tolerances and investment needs as well as different capabilities to analyse investment opportunities. Indeed, professional investors have a higher risk tolerance than retail investors, are able to perform thorough analyses of investment possibilities and due diligence of assets and their valuation, and might, due to their nature and activities, have different return objectives compared to retail investors. Despite that, and because of the almost identical rules and the resulting high administrative burden and associated costs for ELTIFs intended for professional investors, asset managers have to date been reluctant to offer tailored products to professional investors.

That high investment limit for eligible investment assets in ELTIFs’ portfolios was initially established in view of the focus of ELTIFs on long-term investments and the contribution such investments were expected to make to the financing of sustainable growth of the Union’s economy. Given the illiquid and idiosyncratic nature of certain eligible investment assets within ELTIFs’ portfolios, however, it can prove difficult and costly for managers of ELTIFs to manage the liquidity of ELTIFs, honour redemption requests, enter into borrowing arrangements, and execute other elements of ELTIFs’ investment strategies pertaining to the transfer, valuation and pledging of such eligible investment assets. Lowering the limit for eligible investment assets would therefore enable managers of ELTIFs to better manage the liquidity of ELTIFs. Only eligible investment assets of ELTIFs other than collective investment undertakings and eligible investment assets of collective investment undertakings in which ELTIFs have invested should be combined for the purpose of assessing compliance by those ELTIFs with the investment limit for eligible investment assets.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The existing diversification requirements of Regulation (EU) 2015/760 were introduced in order to ensure that ELTIFs can withstand adverse market circumstances. However, those provisions have proven to be too burdensome because in practice they mean that ELTIFs are, on average, required to make 10 distinct investments. In relation to investment in projects or large-scale infrastructure, the requirement to make 10 investments per ELTIF can be difficult to achieve, and costly in terms of transactional costs and capital allocation. To reduce transaction and administrative costs for ELTIFs, and ultimately their investors, ELTIFs should therefore be able to pursue more concentrated investment strategies and thus have exposures to fewer eligible assets. It is therefore necessary to adjust the diversification requirements for ELTIFs’ exposures to single qualifying portfolio undertakings, single real assets, collective investment undertakings and certain other eligible investment assets, contracts and financial instruments. That additional flexibility in the portfolio composition of ELTIFs and the reduction in the diversification requirements should not materially affect the capacity of ELTIFs to withstand market volatility, since ELTIFs typically invest in assets that do not have a readily available market quotation, that might be highly illiquid, and that frequently have long-term maturity or a longer time horizon.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Leverage is frequently used to enable the day-to-day operation of an ELTIF and to carry out a specific investment strategy. Moderate amounts of leverage can, where adequately controlled, amplify returns without incurring or exacerbating excessive risks. In addition, leverage can frequently be used by a variety of collective investment undertakings to gain additional efficiencies or operational results. Since the borrowing of cash is at present limited in Regulation (EU) 2015/760 to 30 % of the value of the capital of ELTIFs, managers of ELTIFs might be unable to successfully pursue certain investment strategies, including in the case of investments in real assets, where using higher levels of leverage is an industry norm or is otherwise required to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. It is therefore appropriate to increase the flexibility of managers of ELTIFs to raise further capital during the life of an ELTIF. At the same time, it is desirable to enhance the management of leverage and to promote a greater consistency with Directive 2011/61/EU with respect to borrowing policy by replacing capital with net asset value as the appropriate point of reference for determining the borrowing of cash limit, which should be accompanied by improvements to the rectification policy. In view of the possible risks that leverage can entail, ELTIFs that can be marketed to retail investors should be permitted to borrow cash amounting to no more than 50 % of the net asset value of the ELTIF. The 50 % limit is appropriate given the overall borrowing of cash limits common for funds investing in real assets with a similar liquidity and redemption profile.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">For ELTIFs marketed to professional investors, however, a higher leverage limit should be permitted, because professional investors have a higher risk tolerance than retail investors. The borrowing of cash limit for ELTIFs that are marketed solely to professional investors should therefore be extended to no more than 100 % of the ELTIF’s net asset value. Moreover, to date, Regulation (EU) 2015/760 does not offer the manager of an ELTIF the possibility of rectifying the investment position, within an appropriate period of time, in cases where the ELTIF infringes the leverage limit and the infringement is beyond the control of the manager of the ELTIF. Taking into account the volatility of the net asset value as a reference value and the interests of the investors in the ELTIF, it should therefore be specified that the provisions on rectification in Regulation (EU) 2015/760 apply also to borrowing limits.</p>

In order to alleviate those burdens without diminishing investor protection, ELTIFs should inform the competent authority of the ELTIF about the orderly disposal of their assets in order to redeem investors’ units or shares after the end of the life of the ELTIF, and only provide the competent authority of the ELTIF with an itemised schedule where they are expressly asked to do so by that competent authority.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">At present, for potential retail investors whose financial instrument portfolio does not exceed EUR 500 000, Regulation (EU) 2015/760 requires an initial minimum investment in one or more ELTIFs of EUR 10 000 and requires that such investors do not invest an aggregate amount exceeding 10 % of their financial instrument portfolio in ELTIFs. When applied together, the EUR 10 000 initial minimum investment and the 10 % limit on aggregate investment create a significant obstacle to investments in ELTIFs for retail investors, which conflicts with the goal of ELTIFs to establish a retail alternative investment fund product. It is therefore necessary to remove the EUR 10 000 initial minimum investment requirement and the 10 % limit on aggregate investment.</p>
