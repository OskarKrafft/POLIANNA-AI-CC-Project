In its communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal, the Commission indicated that the decarbonisation of the gas sector would be facilitated, including by addressing the issue of energy-related methane emissions. In October 2020, the Commission adopted an EU strategy to reduce methane emissions (the ‘Methane Strategy’) setting out measures to cut methane emissions in the Union, including in the energy sector, and at global level. Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_202401787EN.000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_202401787EN.000101-E0004"

It follows from the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for this Regulation that, under the assumptions of the preferred policy option for the methane legislative proposal combined with the assumptions of the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package, 77 % of all methane emissions associated with oil, gas and coal projected for 2030 can be reduced cost effectively from a social and environmental perspective. That would contribute to limiting global warming to 1,5 <span class="oj-super">o</span>C and would allow the Union to effectively take the lead in fighting methane emissions and to strengthen its energy security.</p>

In addition, it allows for a harmonised set of competences and level of expertise that may not be available to all public entities.

The verification activities should be aligned with the relevant European or other international standards and methodologies for verifiers and should take due account of the nature of the verified activities. The verifiers should review the data in the emissions reports to assess the reliability, credibility and accuracy of the data. To ensure the accuracy of the data, verifiers should, where relevant, carry out announced and unannounced site checks. Verifiers should be separate from competent authorities and should be independent from the operators, undertakings, mine operators and importers, who should provide them with all assistance necessary to enable or facilitate the verification activities, in particular as regards access to the sites and the presentation of documentation or records.</p>

Tier 1 methods typically use IPCC default emission factors and require the most basic, and least disaggregated, activity data. Higher tiers usually utilise more elaborate methods and source-, technology-, region- or country-specific emission factors, which are often based on measurements, and normally require more highly disaggregated activity data. Specifically, tier 2 requires the use of country-specific, instead of default, emission factors, while tier 3 requires plant-by-plant data or measurements and comprises the application of a rigorous bottom-up assessment by source type at the individual facility level. The IPCC stated in its 2019 Refinement to the IPCC 2006 guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories that progressing from tier 1 to tier 3 represents an increase in the certainty of measurements of methane-related emissions.</p>

Reporting at tier 1, the lowest level, is still very common in several Member States for methane emissions from coal, gas and oil.

A key industry-led initiative in the energy sector is the OGMP, a voluntary initiative on measuring and reporting methane emissions, created in 2014 by UNEP and CCAC, on whose board the Commission is represented. The OGMP focuses on establishing best practices to improve the availability of global information on methane emission quantification and management and to drive mitigation actions to reduce methane emissions. The OGMP’s work on developing standards and methodologies involves governments, civil society and business. To date, over 115 companies, with assets in more than 60 countries on five continents, representing over 35 % of the world’s oil and gas production and over 70 % of LNG flows have become members of UNEP’s OGMP 2.0. The OGMP 2.0 framework is the latest iteration of a dynamic methane emissions standard and can provide a suitable basis for methane emissions standards, based on sound scientific standards.</p>

It allows the use of generic emission factors. OGMP 2.0 level 4 reporting requires direct measurements of source-level methane emissions and allows the use of specific emission factors. OGMP 2.0 level 5 reporting requires complementary site-level measurements in addition to source-level quantification of methane emissions. In addition, the OGMP 2.0 framework requires companies to report direct measurements of methane emissions within 3 years of joining OGMP 2.0 for operated assets and within 5 years for non-operated assets. The deadlines within which operators and undertakings are to submit reports required under this Regulation should be set, building on the approach taken by OGMP 2.0 with regard to source-level reporting and taking into account that a large number of Union companies have already joined OGMP 2.0. In addition to source-level quantification, site-level quantification allows assessment, verification and reconciliation of source-level estimates aggregated by site, thereby providing improved confidence in reported emissions. Similar to the OGMP 2.0 framework, site-level measurements to reconcile source-level quantification should be required.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Obligations regarding LDAR surveys should reflect good practices. LDAR surveys should be primarily aimed at finding and eliminating as quickly as possible leaks by repair or replacement of the leaking component, rather than quantifying them, and those areas with a higher risk of leaks should be checked more frequently. The determination of the frequency of LDAR surveys and the decision to repair or replace a component should be guided not only by the need to repair or replace components from which methane is escaping above the methane emission threshold but also by operational considerations, taking into account risks to safety. Thus, where a higher risk to safety or higher risk of methane emissions is identified, the competent authorities should be allowed to recommend more frequent LDAR surveys for the relevant components or the replacement of components with technology that is less prone to leaks. All leaks, irrespective of their size, should be surveyed and checked, as small leaks can develop into larger ones. Leak repairs should be followed by confirmation that they have been effective. In order to allow for new or more advanced components or technologies for the detection of methane emissions to be used, the size of methane loss at or above which repair is required should be specified, while leaving to the operators the choice of detection device. Where appropriate, it should be possible to use detection technologies, such as continuous monitoring, as part of LDAR surveys as long as they fulfil the requirements for advanced detection technologies of this Regulation. Best performing operators producing or processing oil or natural gas should be able to apply different LDAR survey frequencies, subject to the fulfilment of the conditions in this Regulation and the approval of the competent authorities.</p>

Routine flaring should be prohibited. Flaring should be allowed when it is the only alternative to venting and where venting is not prohibited. The elimination of routine flaring would also increase the availability of natural gas for gas markets. Venting is more harmful to the environment than flaring as the gas released typically contains high levels of methane, whereas flaring oxidises methane into CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> which has a lower global warming potential.

In active underground coal mines, methane concentration in the air is continuously controlled as it constitutes a health and safety hazard. In the case of underground coal mines, the vast majority of methane emissions occur through ventilation and drainage or degasification systems, which represent the two main ways of lowering methane concentrations in a coal mine’s airways.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Once production has ceased and a coal mine is closed or abandoned, it continues to release methane, referred to as ‘abandoned mine methane’ (AMM). Such methane emissions typically occur at well defined source points, such as ventilation shafts or pressure-relief vents. With increased climate ambition and shifting energy production to less carbon-intensive energy sources, AMM emissions are likely to increase in the Union. It is estimated that even 10 years after mining has ceased, methane from non-flooded coal mines continues to be emitted at levels attaining approximately 40 % of those recorded at the time of closure. Moreover, treatment of AMM remains fragmented due to different ownership and exploitation rights and obligations across the Union. Member States should therefore establish inventories of closed underground coal mines and abandoned underground coal mines where operations have ceased after 3 August 1954 and the identified party responsible should be required to install devices for the measurement of methane emissions.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Active surface coal mines in the Union produce lignite and emit less methane than underground coal mines. Lignite coal mines in the Union are predominantly opencast surface coal mines, with the exception of one lignite underground coal mine in one Member State. According to the Union greenhouse gas inventory, in 2019, active surface coal mines emitted 166 kilotonnes of methane compared to 828 kilotonnes of methane from underground coal mines. Measurement of methane emissions from surface coal mines is challenging due to the tendency of methane to diffuse over a wide area. Therefore, and despite the availability of adequate technology, methane emissions from surface coal mines are rarely measured. Methane emissions from surface coal mines can be derived using basin-specific coal emission factors and, with greater precision, using mine- or deposit-specific emission factors, since coal basins have deposits with different methane-bearing capacity. Emission factors can be derived from measuring gas content of the seams sampled from exploration borehole cores. Mine operators should therefore quantify methane emissions in surface coal mines using such emission factors.</p>

Energy diplomacy on methane emissions has already yielded important outcomes. In September 2021, the Union and the United States announced the Global Methane Pledge, launched at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in November 2021. The Global Methane Pledge represents a political commitment to work together in order to collectively reduce global methane emissions by 30 % compared to 2020 levels by 2030, and to take comprehensive domestic actions to achieve that target. It also includes a commitment to move towards using best available inventory methodologies to quantify methane emissions. More than 100 countries, accounting for nearly half of global anthropogenic methane emissions, have already joined the Global Methane Pledge.</p>

The levels of measurement and reporting set out in the information requirements applied to importers should correspond to the ones applied to Union operators. Furthermore, the obligation on importers to provide information on measures taken to control methane emissions should not be more burdensome than the corresponding obligation on Union operators. Member States should communicate the information on those measures to the Commission. On the basis of that information, the Union should set up and manage a methane transparency database, containing, inter alia, information reported by Union undertakings and by importers of crude oil, natural gas and coal. Such a database would serve as a source of information for the purchasing decisions of importers of crude oil, natural gas and coal, as well as for other stakeholders and the public. In addition to the methane transparency database, the Commission should develop methane performance profiles, containing the methane emissions data related to crude oil, natural gas and coal placed on the Union market. Those profiles should also include an assessment of the efforts undertaken by Union producers, importers and third-country producers and exporters of fossil energy to the Union to measure and report, as well as reduce, their methane emissions. Those profiles should further include information on the regulatory actions regarding the measurement, reporting, verification and mitigation taken by third countries where crude oil, natural gas and coal is produced.</p>
