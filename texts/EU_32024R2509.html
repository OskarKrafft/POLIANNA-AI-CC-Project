The rules related to the recording, storage, transfer and processing of data should comply with applicable data protection rules. The single integrated IT system should be developed with a view to avoiding double reporting and reducing administrative burden for Member States and other implementing entities. The Commission should act as the controller and be responsible for the development, management and supervision of the single integrated IT system. Member States, Union investigative, control and audit bodies including the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), the Court of Auditors and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (the ‘EPPO’) should have access to those data within the exercise of their respective competences. Such access should respect the principles of necessity and proportionality.

With regard to budget implementation, the application of that principle implies that citizens should know where, and for what purpose, funds are spent by the Union. Such information fosters democratic debate, contributes to the participation of citizens in the Union’s decision-making process, reinforces institutional control and scrutiny over Union expenditure, and contributes to boosting its credibility. Communication should be more targeted and should aim to increase the visibility of the Union contribution for citizens. Such objectives should be achieved by the publication, preferably using modern communication tools, of relevant information concerning all recipients of funds financed from the budget which takes into account those recipients’ legitimate interests of confidentiality and security and, as far as natural persons are concerned, their right to privacy and the protection of their personal data. Union institutions should therefore adopt a selective approach in the publication of information, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

It is therefore necessary to allow the deduction from the revenue of the budget of any interest or other charge due on the amounts of cancelled or reduced fines, other penalties or sanctions, including any negative return related to those amounts. This exception to the prohibition on negative revenue should be limited to that specific situation. In order to comply with the general principle of restoration to the prior state (<span class="oj-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>) applicable to fines, other penalties or sanctions imposed by Union institutions that are later cancelled or reduced by the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is necessary to provide that any negative return on the provisionally collected amount of such fines, other penalties or sanctions imposed by Union institutions not be deducted from the amount to be repaid. To compensate for the loss of enjoyment of monies from the date the concerned third parties provisionally paid the fine to the Commission until the date of repayment, the amount to be repaid should be increased by interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations increased by one and a half percentage points as an adequate compensation for such third parties in such situations, which excludes the need to apply any other interest rate on that amount. Furthermore, that rate corresponds to the interest rate applicable in relation to the debtor when the debtor chooses to defer the payment of a fine, other penalty or sanction, and provides a financial guarantee instead of payment. Such interest and charges should only be deducted as negative revenue until 31 December 2027, pending a definitive solution for the multiannual financial framework after 2027 relative to the rate of interest and other charges that should be paid as adequate compensation for the reimbursement of cancelled or reduced fines, other penalties or sanctions. This definitive solution should take stock of past experience and expected future developments and should be in line with the application of the budgetary principles laid down in this Regulation. In order to secure sufficient cash flow to compensate the concerned third parties for the loss of enjoyment of monies where a fine, other penalty or sanction has been cancelled or their amount has been reduced, it could be necessary to allow for the amounts received by way of fines, other penalties or sanctions and any accrued interest or other income generated by them to be entered in the budget by the end of the following financial year. In order to ensure full transparency of this mechanism, the Commission should provide all information available in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p>

However, due to the limited number of cases submitted to them and for reasons of efficiency, it is appropriate to transfer their functions to an interinstitutional panel established pursuant to this Regulation (the ‘panel’). The panel should be set up to assess requests and issue recommendations on the need to take decisions on exclusion and imposition of financial penalties referred to it by the Commission or other Union institutions and bodies, without prejudice to their administrative autonomy in respect of members of their staff. That transfer also aims to avoid duplication and to mitigate the risks of contradictory recommendations or opinions, in cases where both an economic operator and a member of staff of a Union institution or body are involved. It is necessary to maintain the procedure by which it is possible for an authorising officer to seek confirmation of an instruction which that officer considers to be irregular or contrary to the principle of sound financial management, and thus be released from any liability. The composition of the panel should be modified when it fulfils this role. The panel should have no investigative powers.</p>

At the same time, in order to give a longer-term perspective to the potential recipients, it is necessary to allow for financing decisions to be adopted for more than one financial year while specifying that the implementation is subject to the availability of budget appropriations for the respective financial years. Furthermore, it is necessary to reduce the number of the elements required for the financing decision. In line with the aim of simplification, the financing decision should at the same time constitute an annual or multiannual work programme. Since contributions to the Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 are already established in the budget, there should be no requirement to adopt a specific financing decision in that respect.</p>

It should therefore be possible to rely on audits already carried out by independent auditors provided that there is sufficient evidence of their competence and independence and provided that the audit work is based on internationally accepted audit standards providing reasonable assurance, and that they have been conducted on the financial statements and reports setting out the use of the Union contribution. Such audits should then form the basis of the overall assurance on the use of Union funds. To that end, it is important to ensure that the report of the independent auditor and the related audit documentation is made available on request to the European Parliament, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the audit authorities of Member States.</p>

Whilst respecting any international agreements of the Union, the award of Union funds in relation to strategic assets and interests, such as digital or space infrastructure, communication and information systems and services, can require the application of specific conditions to ensure such protection including for the integrity of communication and information systems, and of related supply chains. The types of conditions and requirements for applying them should be clarified. Nonetheless, specific conditions laid down in this Regulation are not exhaustive, and it is possible for a basic act to include specific conditions provided that it does not modify or derogate from requirements and procedures laid down in this Regulation in respect of the protection of security and public order.</p>

It is important to avoid that a person or entity in an exclusion situation is able to apply for or to be selected for implementing Union funds, or to receive such funds under a programme in shared management. Where there is a final judgment or a final administrative decision, the authorising officer responsible should be able to exclude a person or entity, provided that the latter is in an exclusion situation and deemed not reliable due to having engaged in certain types of serious misconduct. Without prejudice to information obligations set out in other basic acts, persons and entities implementing the budget under shared management should convey to the Commission, through any official channel, such as the automated information system established by the Commission currently in use for reporting of fraud and irregularities (the ‘Irregularity Management System’), information pertaining to established facts and findings, in the context of such final judgments or final administrative decisions only with reference to the grounds set out under Article 138(1), points (c)(iv) and (d), when they become aware of such information. In the absence of a final judgment or a final administrative decision, the authorising officer responsible should be able to exclude, on the basis of a preliminary classification in law made by the panel, having regard to facts and findings established in the context of audits or investigations carried out by OLAF, the EPPO or the Court of Auditors or any other check, audit or control performed under the responsibility of the authorising officer. Such exclusion should be registered in the early detection and exclusion system database. Persons and entities implementing the budget under shared management should consult the early detection and exclusion system database prior to awarding Union funds or selecting participants and beneficiaries. This consultation should concern the person or entity applying for or selected to implement Union funds. To ensure the effective implementation of the early detection and exclusion system, the competent authorities of the Member States should enforce the exclusions recorded in the database with regard to such persons or entities applying for or selected to implement Union funds for the entire duration of the exclusion. That exclusion should uphold the integrity of the procurement or selection process and safeguard it against the participation of individuals or entities involved in a serious misconduct. Payment applications from Member States under shared management, including expenditure related to a person or entity that has been excluded, should not be reimbursed. Where funds are disbursed to Member States under performance-based frameworks, specific rules should apply, as set out in sector-specific rules.</p>

Therefore, the responsibilities of the Commission should be limited to the obligation to refer a case to the panel for the purpose of excluding a person or entity if the authorising officer becomes aware of serious misconduct following final judgments, final administrative decisions, or facts and findings established in the context of audits or investigations carried out concerning those funds by OLAF, the EPPO or the Court of Auditors or any other check, audit, or control performed under the responsibility of the authorising officer.

                           <p class="oj-normal">In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to modify the definition of crisis, which applies in particular to the common provisions and to procurement in the field of external actions and should cover public and animal health, food security and food safety emergencies and global health threats. In order to allow the flexibility needed to ensure a rapid response to unforeseen circumstances of extreme urgency resulting from a crisis, the contracting authority should be allowed to apply simplified procurement rules, such as use of negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice applicable to crisis situations and acceptance of evidence on exclusion and selection criteria from the presumed successful tenderer after the award decision but in any case before the signature of the contract. The contracting authority should also have flexibility to exceptionally modify a contract or a framework contract, beyond the applicable thresholds, without a procurement procedure in order to respond to a crisis. Moreover, in a situation of crisis it should be possible, exceptionally, to add new contracting authorities after the launch of a procurement procedure and before the contract signature or following a modification of a contract without restricting competition. A declaration of crisis should be required in line with the relevant internal rules prior to having recourse to such simplified rules, except for procurement in the field of external action where such declaration is not required. In addition, the authorising officers responsible should justify case-by-case the extreme urgency resulting from the declared crisis.</p>

The notion of a ‘conflict of interests’ should be solely used for cases where a person or entity with responsibilities for budget programming, implementation, audit or control, or an official or an agent of a Union institution or national authorities at any level, is in such a situation. Attempts to unduly influence an award procedure or obtain confidential information should be treated as grave professional misconduct which can lead to the rejection from the award procedure and/or exclusion from Union funds. In addition, economic operators might be in a situation where they should not be selected to implement a contract because of a professional conflicting interest. For instance, a company should not evaluate a project in which it has participated or an auditor should not be in a position to audit accounts it has previously certified. The assessment of conflicts of interest, and the obligation to set up systems to detect and prevent such conflicts, should respect the principle of proportionality. Appropriate guidance on the assessment of conflicts of interest should provide additional clarification to those assessing such situations at Union and national level, with a view to contributing to legal certainty.</p>

In order to align Union procurement rules with Directive 2014/24/EU, contracting authorities should also be allowed to use as an award criterion the organisation, qualification and experience of the staff assigned to perform the contract, where they can significantly affect the quality of contract performance and, as a result, the economic value of the tender. Contracting authorities which make use of any of those award criteria should ensure, by appropriate contractual means, that the staff assigned to contract performance effectively fulfil the specified quality standards. The contracting authorities should give their consent to any replacement of such staff and should verify whether replacing staff affords an equivalent level of quality as the replaced staff. Furthermore, it should be ensured that there is no overlap and double evaluation of the same element under the selection and award criteria.</p>

In particular, those systems should be operated in the form of a restricted procedure, thus allowing for any economic operator that submits a request to participate and meets the exclusion and selection criteria to take part in procurement procedures carried out through the dynamic purchasing system over its period of validity, which should not be limited to four years. Tenders can also be presented in the form of an electronic catalogue particularly for off-the-shelf products or services generally available on the market. Moreover, in order to reduce the administrative burden, the requirement to appoint an opening and evaluation committee should be waived for specific procurements under a dynamic purchasing system.</p>

In particular, a new procurement procedure should not be required in the event of administrative changes, universal succession and application of clear and unequivocal revision clauses or options that do not alter the minimum requirements of the initial procedure. A new procurement procedure should be required in the case of material modifications to the initial contract, in particular to the scope and content of the mutual rights and obligations of the parties, including as regards the distribution of intellectual property rights. Such modifications demonstrate the parties’ intention to renegotiate the essential terms or conditions of that contract, in particular if the modifications would have had an influence on the outcome of the procedure had the modified terms or conditions been part of the initial procedure.</p>

Regardless of the field of Union intervention, lump sums, unit costs and flat rates are suitable forms of financing, in particular for standardised and recurrent actions, such as mobility or training activities. Moreover, as institutional cooperation between public administrations of Member States and of beneficiary or partner countries (institutional twinning) is implemented by Member State institutions, the use of simplified cost options is justified and should foster their engagement. In the interest of increased efficiency, Member States and other recipients of Union funds should be able to make more frequent use of simplified cost options. In this context, the conditions for using lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should be made more flexible. It is necessary to provide explicitly for the establishment of single lump sums covering the entire eligible costs of the action or the work programme. In addition, in order to foster focus on results, priority should be given to output-based funding. Input-based lump sums, unit costs and flat rates should remain an option where output-based ones are not possible or appropriate.</p>

Those conditions should not require reporting on the costs actually incurred by the beneficiary. Where the amounts of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing have been determined <span class="oj-italic">ex ante</span> by the authorising officer responsible or by the Commission they should not be challenged by <span class="oj-italic">ex post</span> controls.

In particular, a grant should be reduced where the conditions triggering the payment of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates have not been fulfilled. The frequency and scope of the periodic assessment should depend on the evolution and the nature of the costs, in particular taking into account substantial changes in market prices and other relevant circumstances. The periodic assessment could lead to adjustments of the lump sums, unit costs or flat rates applicable to future agreements, but should not be used for questioning the value of the lump sums, unit costs or flat rates already agreed upon. The periodic assessment of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates might require access to the accounts of the beneficiary for statistical and methodological purposes and such access is also necessary for fraud-prevention and detection purposes.</p>

Without prejudice to the maximum co-financing rate specified in the basic act, in such cases, the Union grant should be limited to the estimated eligible costs other than those covering volunteers’ work. As volunteers’ work is a work provided by third parties without a remuneration being paid to them by the beneficiary, the limitation avoids reimbursing costs which the beneficiary did not incur.

It is important to establish a common framework to ensure the homogeneity of the principles applicable to that set of instruments and to regroup them under a new Title in this Regulation, comprising sections on budgetary guarantees and on financial assistance to Member States or third countries in addition to the existing rules applicable to financial instruments.</p>

It fragments the supply of Union debt securities and reduces liquidity and investor interest in the separate programmes, even though all Union debt securities have the same high credit quality. Financial assistance should therefore be organised under a single funding method that enhances the liquidity of Union bonds and the attractiveness and cost-effectiveness of Union issuance.</p>

The characteristics of those instruments are that they generate a contingent liability for the Union and imply the provisioning of funds to make available a liquidity cushion that allows the budget to respond in an orderly manner to the payment obligations that might arise from those contingent liabilities. In order to guarantee the credit rating of the Union and, hence, its capacity to deliver effective financing, it is essential that the authorisation, provisioning and monitoring of contingent liabilities follow a robust set of rules that should be applied to all budgetary guarantees.</p>

Such conditions should include the existence of appropriate internal and external systems to combat fraud and irregularities, whereby the systems operated by implementing entities of the global initiative should be considered as external systems. The use of the provisions related to global initiatives should be limited to cases where other budget implementation instruments do not enable the achievement of the respective Union policy objectives with the same scale and impact. Where possible and appropriate, the Commission should join any governance board or equivalent steering committee of a global initiative in order to ensure effective representation of the Union interest. In the interests of transparency and effective decision-making, the Commission should, as early as possible, provide detailed information to the European Parliament and the Council on any intended contribution to a global initiative, so as to enable them to give that information due consideration.</p>

That instrument should be implemented under direct management or under indirect management by a Union body. Related provisions, such as definitions, suspension, termination and reduction, and evaluation committee should be adjusted accordingly.

                           <p class="oj-normal">In its Communication on the European Green Deal, the Commission encourages the renovation of buildings in order to reduce their emissions and make them more energy efficient. Taking into account the rapid evolution of the market for energy efficient buildings, there is an acute need for Union institutions to incorporate the European Green Deal commitments in their own building policy and to renovate their buildings, prioritising the most energy-efficient investments. In addition, the recent development of working methods accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic requires adapting the Union institutions’ office stock in order to develop a dynamic office policy. As a consequence, financing of structural renovations by loans should be allowed, provided that it leads to savings, in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. The European Parliament and the Council should receive sufficient information for the purposes of their prior approval, including on the added value of the envisaged structural renovation and its contribution to the green transition. The interpretation of the concept of new building projects should be broadened and, in particular, include projects concerning structural renovation.</p>

It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

Such delegation shall be without prejudice to the responsibility of Heads of Union delegations for budget implementation. Where the absence of a Head of Union delegation exceeds four weeks, the Commission shall revise its decision to delegate powers of budget implementation.

In the exceptional cases where Commission staff of Union delegations act as authorising officers by subdelegation of the EEAS, they shall apply the EEAS internal rules for budget implementation and shall be subject to the same duties, obligations and accountability as any other authorising officer by subdelegation of the EEAS.</p>
