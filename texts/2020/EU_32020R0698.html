For the same reason, difficulties in renewing and replacing driver cards as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID‐19 outbreak justify the granting to the competent authorities of the Member States of additional time for those purposes. In such cases, drivers should be put in a position, and should be obliged, to resort to viable alternatives for recording the necessary information related to driving time, working time and rest periods until they receive a new card.</p>

The COVID‐19 outbreak and the associated public health crisis have serious repercussions for the financial situation of the sector, and some transport undertakings no longer satisfy the requirement of financial standing. Given the reduced level of activity resulting from the public health crisis, it is anticipated that it will take longer than usual for undertakings to demonstrate that the requirement of financial standing is again satisfied on a permanent basis. It is therefore appropriate to extend the maximum time limit established for those purposes in Article 13(1), point (c), of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 from six to twelve months, with regard to assessments of financial standing of transport undertakings covering all or part of the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2020.

The international carriage of goods by road and the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus are subject, inter alia, to the possession of a Community licence and, in the case of drivers who are nationals of third countries and who conduct freight transport operations, to a driver attestation. The provision of regular services by bus and coach is also conditional upon authorisation. Those licences, attestations and authorisations may be renewed after verification that the relevant conditions are still being complied with. Due to difficulties in renewing the licences and attestations as a consequence of the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID‐19 outbreak, it is necessary to extend their validity by six months from their date of expiry, in order to ensure the continuity of road transport.</p>

It should therefore be provided that where the licensing authority, on the basis of the check carried out during the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020, finds that a railway undertaking can no longer meet the requirements relating to financial fitness, it should be able to, before 31 August 2020, decide not to suspend or revoke the licence of the railway undertaking concerned, provided that safety is not at risk and provided that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction of the railway undertaking within the following six months. After 31 August 2020, the railway undertaking should be subject to the general rules laid down in Article 24(1) of that Directive.</p>

Member States have been affected to different degrees and at different times. Given that the derogations from the rules that would normally apply should be limited to what is necessary, it should, with regard to Directive 2006/126/EC, Regulation (EU) No 165/2014, Directive 2014/45/EU, Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009, Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 and Directive 2007/59/EC, be possible for the Member States to continue to apply those legal acts without applying the derogations provided for in this Regulation where application of those legal acts has remained practicable. The same should apply where a Member State was confronted by such difficulties but adopted appropriate national measures to mitigate them. The Member States that choose to make use of that possibility should not, however, impede any economic operator or individual from relying on the derogations provided for in this Regulation that apply in another Member State, and should in particular recognise any licence, certificate and authorisation the validity of which has been extended by this Regulation.</p>
