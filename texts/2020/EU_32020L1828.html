To improve the deterrence of unlawful practices and to reduce consumer detriment in an increasingly globalised and digitalised marketplace, it is necessary to strengthen procedural mechanisms for the protection of the collective interests of consumers to cover injunctive measures as well as redress measures.

Taking into account their legal traditions, it should leave it to the discretion of the Member States whether to design the procedural mechanism for representative actions required by this Directive as part of an existing or as part of a new procedural mechanism for collective injunctive measures or redress measures, or as a distinct procedural mechanism, provided that at least one national procedural mechanism for representative actions complies with this Directive. For instance, this Directive should not prevent Member States from adopting laws on actions seeking declaratory decisions by a court or administrative authority even though it does not provide for rules on such actions. If there were procedural mechanisms in place at national level in addition to the procedural mechanism required by this Directive, the qualified entity should be able to choose which procedural mechanism to use.</p>

Accordingly, it is for the Member States to lay down rules, for instance, on admissibility, evidence or the means of appeal, applicable to representative actions. For example, it should be for Member States to decide on the required degree of similarity of individual claims or the minimum number of consumers concerned by a representative action for redress measures in order for the case to be admitted to be heard as a representative action. Such national rules should not hamper the effective functioning of the procedural mechanism for representative actions required by this Directive. In accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, the admissibility requirements applicable to specific cross-border representative actions should not differ from those applied to specific domestic representative actions. A decision to declare a representative action inadmissible should not affect the rights of the consumers concerned by the action.</p>

In particular, as there is increased consumer demand for financial and investment services, it is important to improve the enforcement of consumer law in those areas. The consumer market has also evolved in the area of digital services, and there is an increased need for more efficient enforcement of consumer law, including as regards data protection.</p>

Qualified entities should not be the subject of insolvency proceedings or be declared to be insolvent. They should be independent and should not be influenced by persons other than consumers who have an economic interest in the bringing of a representative action, in particular by traders or hedge funds, including in the event of funding by third parties. Qualified entities should have established procedures to prevent such influence as well as to prevent conflicts of interest between themselves, their funding providers and the interests of consumers. They should make publicly available, in plain and intelligible language, by any appropriate means, in particular on their websites, information demonstrating that they comply with the criteria for designation as a qualified entity and general information about the sources of their funding in general, their organisational, management and membership structure, statutory purpose and activities.</p>

Moreover, injunctive measures could take the form of an obligation on the part of the infringing trader to publish the decision taken by the court or administrative authority on the measure in full or in part, in such form as considered appropriate, or to publish a corrective statement.</p>

Member States should be able to require that that prior consultation takes place jointly with an independent public body that they designate.

The information provided by the qualified entity to the court or administrative authority should enable the court or administrative authority to assess whether the third party could unduly influence the procedural decisions of the qualified entity in the context of the representative action, including decisions on settlement, in a manner that would be detrimental to the collective interests of the consumers concerned, and to assess whether the third party is providing funding for a representative action for redress measures against a defendant who is a competitor of that third-party funding provider or against a defendant on whom the third party funding provider is dependant. The direct funding of a specific representative action by a trader operating in the same market as the defendant should be considered to imply a conflict of interest, since the competitor could have an economic interest in the outcome of the representative action which would not be the same as the consumers’ interest.</p>

If any conflicts of interest are confirmed, the court or administrative authority should be empowered to take appropriate measures, such as requiring the qualified entity to refuse or change the relevant funding and, if necessary, rejecting the legal standing of the qualified entity or declaring a specific representative action for redress measures inadmissible.

When bringing a representative action for an injunctive measure, the qualified entity should sufficiently define the group of consumers whose interests are affected by the alleged infringement, who could possibly have a claim arising from that infringement and who could be affected by the expiry of limitation periods during that representative action. For the avoidance of doubt, also a pending representative action for a redress measure should have the effect of suspending or interrupting the applicable limitation periods in respect of the consumers concerned by that representative action.</p>

However, business-to-consumer relationships are often characterised by information asymmetries and the necessary evidence can be held exclusively by the trader, making it inaccessible to the qualified entity. Qualified entities should therefore have the right to request the court or administrative authority to order the trader to disclose evidence relevant to their claim. On the other hand, taking into account the principle of equality of arms, the trader should have a similar right to request evidence that is in control of the qualified entity. The need, scope and proportionality of orders to disclose evidence should be carefully assessed by the court or administrative authority before which the representative action is brought, in accordance with national procedural law, having regard to the protection of legitimate interests of third parties and subject to the applicable Union and national rules on confidentiality.</p>

There should also be penalties for the failure or refusal to comply with an order to provide information to the consumers concerned regarding final decisions or settlements or for the failure or refusal to disclose evidence.
