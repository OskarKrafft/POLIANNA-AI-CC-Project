According to that Article, the levying of those charges is mandatory in case of regular failure by an applicant, including railway undertakings, to use allocated paths or part of them. Infrastructure managers are to publish in their network statements the criteria to determine such failure to use. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions to rail traffic that have led to widespread train path cancellations. The underlying events were and are beyond the control of railway undertakings. Moreover, they resulted in temporary lower use of capacity. It can therefore be assumed that the incentive effect that reservation charges under Article 36 of Directive 2012/34/EU are intended to produce is not relevant insofar as the reference period is concerned. Member States should therefore have the possibility to authorise infrastructure managers not to levy reservation charges for capacity allocated but not used during the reference period, even where such a non-use would be considered to be a regular failure to use allocated paths or part of them under the criteria currently applicable.</p>

Those income losses would, in principle, be compensated in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 2012/34/EU.
