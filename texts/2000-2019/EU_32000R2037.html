<p>Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 29 June 2000</p><p>on substances that deplete the ozone layer</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>After consulting the Committee of the Regions,</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved on 5 May 2000 by the Conciliation Committee,</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) It is established that continued emissions of ozone-depleting substances at current levels continue to cause significant damage to the ozone layer. Ozone depletion in the southern hemisphere reached unprecedented levels in 1998. In three out of four recent springs severe ozone depletion has occurred in the Arctic region. Increased UV-B radiation resulting from ozone depletion poses a significant threat to health and environment. Further efficient measures need therefore to be taken in order to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting from such emissions.</p><p>(2) In view of its responsibilities for the environment and trade, the Community, pursuant to Decision 88/540/EEC(4), has become a Party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, as amended by the Parties to the Protocol at their second meeting in London and at their fourth meeting in Copenhagen.</p><p>(3) Additional measures for the protection of the ozone layer were adopted by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol at their seventh meeting in Vienna in December 1995 and at their ninth meeting in Montreal in September 1997, in which the Community participated.</p><p>(4) It is necessary for action to be taken at Community level to carry out the Community&#039;s obligations under the Vienna Convention and the latest amendments and adjustments to the Montreal Protocol, in particular to phase out the production and the placing on the market of methyl bromide within the Community and to provide for a system for the licensing not only of imports but also of exports of ozone-depleting substances.</p><p>(5) In view of the earlier than anticipated availability of technologies for replacing ozone-depleting substances, it is appropriate in certain cases to provide for control measures which are stricter than those provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 of 15 December 1994 on substances that deplete the ozone layer(5) and stricter than those of the Montreal Protocol.</p><p>(6) Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 must be modified substantially. It is in the interest of legal clarity and transparency to revise that Regulation completely.</p><p>(7) Under Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 the production of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and hydrobromofluorocarbons has been phased out. The production of those controlled substances is thus prohibited, subject to possible derogation for essential uses and to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol. It is now also appropriate progressively to prohibit the placing on the market and use of those substances and of products and equipment containing those substances.</p><p>(8) Even after the phase-out of controlled substances the Commission may under certain conditions grant exemptions for essential uses.</p><p>(9) The growing availability of alternatives to methyl bromide should be reflected in more substantial reductions in its production and consumption compared to the Montreal Protocol. The production and consumption of methyl bromide should cease completely subject to possible derogations for critical uses determined at Community level following the criteria established under the Montreal Protocol. Also the use of methyl bromide for quarantine and preshipment applications should be controlled. Such use should not exceed current levels and ultimately be reduced in the light of technical development and developments under the Montreal Protocol.</p><p>(10) Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 provides for controls on the production of all other ozone-depleting substances but not for controls on the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons. It is appropriate to introduce such provision to ensure that hydrochlorofluorocarbons do not continue to be used where non-ozone-depleting alternatives exist. Measures for the control of the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons should be taken by all Parties to the Montreal Protocol. A freeze on production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons would reflect that need and the Community&#039;s determination to take a leading role in this respect. The quantities produced should be adapted to the reductions envisaged for the placing on the Community market of hydrochlorofluorocarbons and to the declining demand worldwide as a consequence of reductions in the consumption of hydrochlorofluorocarbons required by the Protocol.</p><p>(11) The Montreal Protocol, in Article 2F(7), requires the Parties to endeavour to ensure that the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons is limited to those applications where other more environmentally suitable alternative substances or technologies are not available. In view of the availability of alternative and substitute technologies, the placing on the market and use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons and products containing hydrochlorofluorocarbons can be further limited. Decision VI/13 of the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol provides that the evaluation of alternatives to hydrochlorofluorocarbons should take into account such factors as ozone-depleting potential, energy efficiency, potential flammability, toxicity and global warming and the potential impacts on the effective use and phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons and halons. Hydrochlorofluorocarbon controls under the Montreal Protocol should be considerably tightened to protect the ozone layer and to reflect the availability of alternatives.</p><p>(12) Quotas for the release for free circulation in the Community of controlled substances should be allocated only for limited uses of controlled substances. Controlled substances and products containing controlled substances from States not party to the Montreal Protocol should not be imported.</p><p>(13) The licensing system for controlled substances should be extended to include the authorisation of exports of controlled substances, in order to monitor trade in ozone-depleting substances and to allow for exchange of information between Parties.</p><p>(14) Provision should be made for the recovery of used controlled substances, and to prevent leakages of controlled substances.</p><p>(15) The Montreal Protocol requires reporting on trade in ozone-depleting substances. Annual reporting should therefore be required from producers, importers and exporters of controlled substances.</p><p>(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).</p><p>(17) Decision X/8 of the 10th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol encourages Parties to take measures actively, as appropriate, to discourage the production and marketing of new ozone-depleting substances and in particular of bromochloromethane. To this end a mechanism should be established to provide for new substances to be addressed by this Regulation. The production, importation, placing on the market and use of bromochloromethane should be prohibited.</p><p>(18) The switch to new technologies or alternative products, required because the production and use of controlled substances are to be phased out, could lead to problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular. The Member States should therefore consider providing appropriate forms of assistance specifically to enable SMEs to make the necessary changes,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER I</p><p>INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 1</p><p>Scope</p><p>This Regulation shall apply to the production, importation, exportation, placing on the market, use, recovery, recycling and reclamation and destruction of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, methyl bromide, hydrobromofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, to the reporting of information on these substances and to the importation, exportation, placing on the market and use of products and equipment containing those substances.</p><p>This Regulation shall also apply to the production, importation, placing on the market and use of substances in Annex II.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation:</p><p>- &quot;Protocol&quot; means the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, as last amended and adjusted,</p><p>- &quot;Party&quot; means any party to the Protocol,</p><p>- &quot;State not party to the Protocol&quot;, with respect to a particular controlled substance, includes any State or regional economic integration organisation that has not agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Protocol applicable to that substance,</p><p>- &quot;controlled substances&quot; means chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, methyl bromide, hydrobromofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, whether alone or in a mixture, and whether they are virgin, recovered, recycled or reclaimed.

Such production and importation shall be allowed only if no adequate alternatives or recycled or reclaimed methyl bromide is available from any of the Parties.</p><p>In an emergency, where unexpected outbreaks of particular pests or diseases so require, the Commission, at the request of the competent authority of a Member State, may authorise the temporary use of methyl bromide. Such authorisation shall apply for a period not exceeding 120 days and to a quantity not exceeding 20 tonnes.</p><p>3. Subject to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10, each producer shall ensure that:</p><p>(a) the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in 1997;</p><p>(b) the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed 35 % of the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in 1997;</p><p>(c) the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed 20 % of the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in 1997;</p><p>(d) the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 and in each 12-month period thereafter does not exceed 15 % of the calculated level of its production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons in 1997;</p><p>(e) it produces no hydrochlorofluorocarbons after 31 December 2025.</p><p>Before 31 December 2002, the Commission shall review the level of production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons with a view to determining:</p><p>- whether a production cut ahead of the year 2008 should be proposed, and/or</p><p>- whether a change to the levels of production provided for under (b), (c) and (d) should be proposed.</p><p>This review will take into account the development of hydrochlorofluorocarbon consumption worldwide, the hydrochlorofluorocarbon exports from the Community and other OECD countries and the technical and economic availability of alternative substances or technologies as well as relevant international developments under the Protocol.</p><p>4. The Commission shall issue licences to those users identified in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2(ii) and shall notify them of the use for which they have authorisation and the substances and quantities thereof that they are authorised to use.</p><p>5. A producer may be authorised by the competent authority of the Member State in which that producer&#039;s relevant production is situated to produce the controlled substances referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 for the purpose of meeting the requests licensed in accordance with paragraph 4. The competent authority of the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission in advance of its intention to issue any such authorisation.</p><p>6. The competent authority of the Member State in which a producer&#039;s relevant production is situated may authorise that producer to exceed the calculated levels of production laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of Parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Protocol, provided that the additional calculated levels of production of the Member State concerned do not exceed those permitted for that purpose by Articles 2A to 2E and 2H of the Protocol for the periods in question. The competent authority of the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission in advance of its intention to issue any such authorisation.</p><p>7. To the extent permitted by the Protocol, the competent authority of the Member State in which a producer&#039;s relevant production is situated may authorise that producer to exceed the calculated levels of production laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 in order to satisfy any essential, or critical, uses of Parties at their request. The competent authority of the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission in advance of its intention to issue any such authorisation.</p><p>8. To the extent permitted by the Protocol, the competent authority of the Member State in which a producer&#039;s relevant production is situated may authorise that producer to exceed the calculated levels of production laid down in paragraphs 1 to 7 for the purpose of industrial rationalisation within the Member State concerned, provided that the calculated levels of production of that Member State do not exceed the sum of the calculated levels of production of its domestic producers as laid down in paragraphs 1 to 7 for the periods in question. The competent authority of the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission in advance of its intention to issue any such authorisation.</p><p>9. To the extent permitted by the Protocol, the Commission may, in agreement with the competent authority of the Member State in which a producer&#039;s relevant production is situated, authorise that producer to exceed the calculated levels of production laid down in paragraphs 1 to 8 for the purpose of industrial rationalisation between Member States, provided that the combined calculated levels of production of the Member States concerned do not exceed the sum of the calculated levels of production of their domestic producers as laid down in paragraphs 1 to 8 for the periods in question. The agreement of the competent authority of the Member State in which it is intended to reduce production shall also be required.</p><p>10. To the extent permitted by the Protocol, the Commission may, in agreement with both the competent authority of the Member State in which a producer&#039;s relevant production is situated and the government of the third Party concerned, authorise a producer to combine the calculated levels of production laid down in paragraphs 1 to 9 with the calculated levels of production allowed to a producer in a third Party under the Protocol and that producer&#039;s national legislation for the purpose of industrial rationalisation with a third Party, provided that the combined calculated levels of production by the two producers do not exceed the sum of the calculated levels of production allowed to the Community producer under paragraphs 1 to 9 and the calculated levels of production allowed to the third Party producer under the Protocol and any relevant national legislation.</p><p></p><p>Article 4</p><p>Control of the placing on the market and use of controlled substances</p><p>1. Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, the placing on the market and the use of the following controlled substances shall be prohibited:</p><p>(a) chlorofluorocarbons;</p><p>(b) other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons;</p><p>(c) halons;</p><p>(d) carbon tetrachloride;</p><p>(e) 1,1,1-trichloroethane; and</p><p>(f) hydrobromofluorocarbons.</p><p>The Commission may, following a request by a competent authority of a Member State and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), authorise a temporary exemption to allow the use of chlorofluorocarbons until 31 December 2004 in delivery mechanisms for hermetically sealed devices designed for implantation in the human body for delivery of measured doses of medication, and until 31 December 2008, in existing military applications, where it is demonstrated that, for a particular use, technically and economically feasible alternative substances or technologies are not available or cannot be used.</p><p>2.
