In doing so, account should be taken of the diversity of the situations that affect rural areas with different characteristics or different categories of potential beneficiaries and of the cross-cutting objectives of innovation, environment and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation action should relate both to limiting emissions in agriculture and forestry from key activities such as livestock production, fertilizer use and to preserving carbon sinks and enhancing carbon sequestration with regard to land use, land use change and the forestry sector. The Union priority for rural development relating to knowledge transfer and innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural areas should apply horizontally in relation to the other Union priorities for rural development.</p>

Each programme should identify a strategy for meeting targets in relation to the Union priorities for rural development and a selection of measures. Programming should comply with Union priorities for rural development, whilst at the same time adapting to national contexts and complementing the other Union policies, in particular the agricultural market policy, the cohesion policy and the common fisheries policy. Member States which opt for preparing a set of regional programmes should also be able to prepare a national framework, without a separate budgetary allocation, in order to facilitate co-ordination among the regions in addressing nation-wide challenges.</p>

Knowledge transfer and information actions should not only take the form of traditional training courses but should also be adapted to the needs of rural actors. Workshops, coaching, demonstration activities, information actions and also short-term farm and forest-exchange schemes and visits should therefore also be supported.

It is also possible for diversification into non-agricultural activities to address the sustainable management of cynegetic resources. A farm and business development measure should facilitate the initial establishment of young farmers and the structural adjustment of their agricultural holding after the initial setting up. Furthermore, diversification of farmers into non-agricultural activities and the setting up and development of non-agricultural SMEs in rural areas should be promoted. That measure should also encourage entrepreneurship of women in rural areas. The development of small farms, which are potentially economically viable should also be encouraged. In order to ensure the viability of new economic activities supported under that measure, support should be made conditional on the submission of a business plan. Support for a business start up should cover only the initial period of the life of such a business and should not become an operating aid. Therefore, where Member States opt to grant aid in instalments, such instalments should be made over a period of no more than five years. In addition, in order to encourage the restructuring of the agricultural sector, support, in the form of annual or one-off payments, should be provided for farmers eligible for the small farmers scheme established by Title V of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 ("the small farmer's scheme") who commit to transfer their entire holding and the corresponding payment entitlements to another farmer.</p>

That measure should cover the extension and improvement of forest resources through the afforestation of land and the creation of agroforestry systems combining extensive agriculture with forestry systems. It should also cover the restoration of forests damaged by fire or other natural disasters and catastrophic events and relevant prevention measures; investments in forestry technologies and in the processing; the mobilising and marketing of forest products aimed at improving the economic and environmental performance of forest holders; and non- remunerative investments which improve ecosystem and climate resilience and environmental value of forest ecosystems. Support should not distort competition and should be market neutral. As a result, limitations relating to the size and legal status of beneficiaries should be imposed. Preventive actions against fires should be undertaken in areas classified by Member States as medium or high fire risk. All preventive actions should be part of a forest protection plan.

They should further encourage farmers and other land managers to serve society as a whole by introducing or continuing to apply agricultural practices that contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation and that are compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment, the landscape and its features, natural resources, and the soil and genetic diversity. In that context the conservation of genetic resources in agriculture and the additional needs of farming systems that are of high nature value should be given specific attention. Payments should contribute to covering additional costs and income foregone resulting from the commitments undertaken and should only cover commitments going beyond relevant mandatory standards and requirements, in accordance with the "polluter pays principle". Member States should also ensure that payments to farmers do not lead to double funding under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. In many situations the synergies resulting from commitments undertaken jointly by a group of farmers multiply the environmental and climate benefit. However, joint actions involve additional transaction costs which should be compensated adequately. In addition, in order to ensure that farmers and other land managers are in a position to correctly implement the commitments they have undertaken, Member States should endeavour to provide them with the required skills and knowledge.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Member States should maintain the level of efforts made during the 2007-2013 programming period and should be required to spend a minimum of 30 % of the total contribution from the EAFRD to each rural development programme on climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as environmental issues. Such spending should be made through agri-environment-climate and organic farming payments and payments to areas facing natural or other specific constraints, through payments for forestry, payments for Natura 2000 areas and climate and environment-related investment support.</p>

Support for that type of co-operation is still necessary but should be adapted in order to better meet the requirements of the knowledge economy. In that context, there should be the possibility for projects by a single operator to be financed under that measure, on condition that the results obtained are disseminated, thus achieving the aim of diffusing new practices, processes or products. In addition, it has become clear that supporting a much broader range of types of co-operation, with a wider range of beneficiaries, from smaller operators to larger ones, can contribute to achieving the objectives of rural development policy by helping operators in rural areas overcome the economic, environmental and other disadvantages of fragmentation. Therefore, that measure should be widened. Support to small operators for organising joint work processes and sharing facilities and resources should help them to be economically viable despite their small scale. Support for horizontal and vertical co-operation among actors in the supply chain, as well as for promotion activities in a local context, should catalyse the economically rational development of short supply chains, local markets and local food chains. Support for joint approaches to environmental projects and practices should help to produce greater and more consistent environmental and climate benefits than those which can be delivered by individual operators acting without reference to others (for example, through practices applied on larger, unbroken areas of land).</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Support should be provided in various forms. Clusters and networks are particularly relevant to the sharing of expertise as well as the development of new and specialised expertise, services and products. Pilot projects are important tools for testing the commercial applicability of technologies, techniques and practices in different contexts, and adapting them where necessary. Operational groups are a pivotal element of the European Innovation Partnership ("EIP") for agricultural productivity and sustainability. Another important tool lies in local development strategies operating outside the framework of LEADER local development – between public and private actors from rural and urban areas. Unlike under the LEADER approach, it is possible for such partnerships and strategies to be limited to one sector or to relatively specific development aims, including those mentioned above. Member States have the possibility to give priority to co-operation among entities involving primary producers. Inter-branch organisations should also be eligible for support under this measure. Such support should be limited to a period of seven years except for collective environmental and climate action in duly justified cases.</p>

In this context, the effective management of risks has an increased importance for farmers. Consequently, a risk management measure should be set up to assist farmers in addressing the most common risks faced by them. That measure should therefore help farmers to cover the premiums they pay for crop, animal and plant insurance as well as help with the setting up of mutual funds and the compensation paid by such funds to farmers for losses suffered as a result of adverse climatic events, the outbreak of animal or plant diseases, pest infestation or environmental incidents. It should also include an income stabilisation tool in the form of a mutual fund to support farmers facing a severe drop in their incomes. In order to ensure that farmers receive equal treatment across the Union, that competition is not distorted and that the international obligations of the Union are respected, specific conditions should be provided for the granting of support under these measures. In order to ensure the effective use of EAFRD resources, support should be limited to active farmers within the meaning of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013.</p>

In order to ensure clarity in the implementation of those operations certain common rules for all investments should be laid down. Those common rules should define the types of expenditure that may be considered to be investment expenditure and should ensure that only such investments that create new value in agriculture receive support. In order to facilitate the implementation of investment projects Member States should have the possibility to pay advances. To ensure the effectiveness, fairness and sustainable impact of EAFRD assistance, rules should be laid down to ensure that investments related to operations are durable and that EAFRD support is not used to distort competition.</p>

Consequently, in every case, support should be granted only if a river basin management plan is in place in the area concerned as required by the Water Framework Directive, and if there is already water metering in place at the level of the investment or it is put in place as part of the investment. Investments in improvements to existing irrigation infrastructure or equipment should lead to a minimum gain in terms of water efficiency, expressed as a potential water saving. If the water body affected by the investment is under stress for reasons related to water quantity as set out in the analytical framework established by the Water Framework Directive, half of the gain in terms of water efficiency should be translated into a real reduction in water use at the level of the supported investment, in order to reduce the stress on the water body concerned. Certain cases should be set out in which it is not possible or necessary for the requirements of potential or effective water savings to apply, including those concerning investments in recycling or re-using water. In addition to supporting investments in improvements to existing equipment provision should be made for the EAFRD to support investments in new irrigation subject to the findings of an environmental analysis. With certain exceptions, support should, however, not be granted for new irrigation where the affected water body is already under stress, in view of the very high risk that granting support in such circumstances would worsen existing environmental problems.</p>
