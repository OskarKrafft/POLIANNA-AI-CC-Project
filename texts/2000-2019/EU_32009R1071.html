It is therefore appropriate that applicants for the post of transport manager should possess high-quality professional knowledge. In order to ensure greater uniformity of examinations and to promote a high quality of training, it is appropriate to provide that Member States may authorise examination and training centres according to criteria to be defined by them. Transport managers should possess the requisite knowledge for managing both national and international transport operations. The list of subjects of which knowledge is required in order to obtain a certificate of professional competence and the procedures for the organisation of examinations are likely to evolve with technical progress, and provision should be made for updating them. It should be possible for Member States to exempt from the examinations persons who can provide proof of continuous experience in managing transport activities.</p>

The national authorities responsible for monitoring undertakings and the validity of their authorisations have a crucial role to play in this respect, and it is appropriate to ensure that they take suitable measures if necessary, in particular in the most serious cases by suspending or withdrawing authorisations or declaring as unsuitable transport managers who are repeatedly negligent or who act in bad faith. This must be preceded by due consideration of the measure with respect to the proportionality principle. An undertaking should, however, be warned in advance and should have a reasonable period of time within which to rectify the situation before incurring such penalties.</p>

Electronic registers of undertakings interconnected throughout the Community, which comply with the Community rules on the protection of personal data, would facilitate such cooperation and reduce the costs involved in checks for both undertakings and administrations. National registers already exist in several Member States. Infrastructure has also been set up with a view to promoting interconnection between Member States.
