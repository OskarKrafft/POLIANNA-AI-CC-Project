                           <p class="oj-normal">The high functionality and relatively low cost of plastic means that this material is increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life. While plastic plays a useful role in the economy and provides essential applications in many sectors, its growing use in short-lived applications, which are not designed for re-use or cost-effective recycling, means that related production and consumption patterns have become increasingly inefficient and linear. Therefore, in the context of the Circular Economy Action Plan laid down in the Communication of the Commission of 2 December 2015 entitled ‘Closing the loop – An EU action plan for the Circular Economy’, the Commission concluded in the European Strategy for Plastics laid down in its Communication of 16 January 2018 entitled ‘A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy’ that the steady increase in plastic waste generation and the leakage of plastic waste into the environment, in particular into the marine environment, must be tackled in order to achieve a circular life cycle for plastics. The European Strategy for Plastics is a step towards establishing a circular economy in which the design and production of plastics and plastic products fully respect re-use, repair and recycling needs and in which more sustainable materials are developed and promoted. The significant negative environmental, health and economic impact of certain plastic products calls for the setting up of a specific legal framework to effectively reduce those negative effects.</p>

Such waste prevention is at the pinnacle of the waste hierarchy enshrined in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2019155EN.01000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2019155EN.01000101-E0004"

This Directive will contribute to the achievement of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 12 to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, which is part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. By retaining the value of products and materials for as long as possible and generating less waste, the economy of the Union can become more competitive and more resilient, while reducing pressure on precious resources and the environment.</p>

Reducing marine litter is a key action for the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 which calls to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Union must play its part in preventing and tackling marine litter and aim to be a standard setter for the world. In that context, the Union is working with partners in many international fora such as G20, G7 and the UN to promote concerted action and this Directive is part of the Union’s efforts in that regard. In order for those efforts to be effective, it is also important that exports of plastic waste from the Union do not result in increased marine litter elsewhere.</p>

Single-use plastic products include a diverse range of commonly used fast-moving consumer products that are discarded after having been used once for the purpose for which they were provided, are rarely recycled, and are prone to becoming litter. A significant proportion of the fishing gear placed on the market is not collected for treatment. Single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic are therefore a particularly serious problem in the context of marine litter, pose a severe risk to marine ecosystems, to biodiversity and to human health and damage activities such as tourism, fisheries and shipping.</p>

However, the impact of those measures on marine litter is not sufficient and there are differences in the scope and the level of ambition amongst national measures to prevent and reduce marine litter. In addition, some of those measures, in particular marketing restrictions for single-use plastic products, could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Union.</p>

Plastics are usually defined as polymeric materials to which additives may have been added. However, that definition would cover certain natural polymers. Unmodified natural polymers, within the meaning of the definition of ‘not chemically modified substances’ in point 40 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc13-L_2019155EN.01000101-E0013" href="#ntr13-L_2019155EN.01000101-E0013"

Therefore, for the purposes of this Directive, the definition of polymer in point 5 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should be adapted and a separate definition should be introduced. Plastics manufactured with modified natural polymers, or plastics manufactured from bio-based, fossil or synthetic starting substances are not naturally occurring and should therefore be addressed by this Directive. The adapted definition of plastics should therefore cover polymer-based rubber items and bio-based and biodegradable plastics regardless of whether they are derived from biomass or are intended to biodegrade over time. Paints, inks and adhesives should not be addressed by this Directive and therefore these polymeric materials should not be covered by the definition.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In order to clearly define the scope of this Directive, the term ‘single-use plastic product’ should be defined. The definition should exclude plastic products that are conceived, designed and placed on the market to accomplish within their life span multiple trips or rotations by being refilled or re-used for the same purpose for which they are conceived. Single-use plastic products are typically intended to be used just once or for a short period of time before being disposed of. Wet wipes for personal care and domestic use should also be within the scope of this Directive, whereas industrial wet wipes should be excluded. To further clarify whether a product is to be considered a single-use plastic product for the purposes of this Directive, the Commission should develop guidelines on single-use plastic products. In view of the criteria set out in this Directive, examples of food containers to be considered as single-use plastic products for the purposes of this Directive are fast-food containers or meal, sandwich, wrap and salad boxes with cold or hot food, or food containers of fresh or processed food that does not need further preparation, such as fruits, vegetables or desserts. Examples of food containers that are not to be considered as single-use plastic products for the purposes of this Directive are food containers with dried food or food that is sold cold requiring further preparation, containers containing food in more than single-serve portions or single-serve portion-sized food containers sold in more than one unit.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Examples of beverage containers to be considered as single-use plastic products are beverage bottles or composite beverage packaging used for beer, wine, water, liquid refreshments, juices and nectars, instant beverages or milk, but not cups for beverages as these are a separate category of single-use plastic products for the purposes of this Directive. As they are not among the single-use plastic products that are found the most on beaches in the Union, glass and metal beverage containers should not be covered by this Directive. However, the Commission should, in the context of the review of this Directive, evaluate, inter alia, caps and lids made of plastic used for glass and metal beverage containers.</p>

By doing so, the use of those readily available and more sustainable alternatives as well as of innovative solutions towards more sustainable business models, re-use alternatives and substitution of materials would be promoted. The restrictions on placing on the market introduced in this Directive should also cover products made from oxo-degradable plastic, as that type of plastic does not properly biodegrade and thus contributes to microplastic pollution in the environment, is not compostable, negatively affects the recycling of conventional plastic and fails to deliver a proven environmental benefit. Furthermore, in view of the high prevalence of expanded polystyrene litter in the marine environment and the availability of alternatives, single-use food and beverage containers and cups for beverages made of expanded polystyrene should also be restricted.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Certain single-use plastic products end up in the environment as a result of inappropriate disposal through the sewer system or other inappropriate release into the environment. Disposal through the sewer system can in addition cause substantial economic damage to sewer networks by clogging pumps and blocking pipes. For those products, there is frequently a significant lack of information about the material characteristics of the product or the appropriate means of waste disposal. Therefore, single-use plastic products that are frequently disposed of through the sewer system or otherwise inappropriately disposed of should be subject to marking requirements. The marking should inform consumers about appropriate waste management options for the product or which waste disposal means are to be avoided for the product in line with the waste hierarchy, and about the presence of plastics in the product as well as the resulting negative environmental impact of littering or of other inappropriate means of disposal of the product. The marking should, as appropriate, be either on the packaging of the product or directly on the product itself. The Commission should be empowered to establish harmonised specifications for the marking and when doing so should, where appropriate, test the perception of the proposed marking with representative groups of consumers to ensure that it is effective and easily understandable. Marking requirements are already required for fishing gear pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Directive 2008/98/EC lays down general minimum requirements for extended producer responsibility schemes. Those requirements should apply to the extended producer responsibility schemes established by this Directive, irrespective of whether their mode of implementation is by legislative act or by means of agreements under this Directive. The relevance of some requirements depends on the characteristics of the product. Separate collection is not required to ensure proper treatment in line with the waste hierarchy for tobacco products with filters containing plastic, wet wipes and balloons. Therefore setting up separate collection for those products should not be mandatory. This Directive should establish extended producer responsibility requirements in addition to those laid down by Directive 2008/98/EC, for example, the requirement for producers of certain single-use plastic products to cover the costs of cleaning up litter. It should also be possible to cover the costs of the setting up of specific infrastructure for collection of post-consumption waste of tobacco products, such as appropriate waste receptacles in common litter hotspots. The calculation methodology for the costs of cleaning up litter should take into account considerations of proportionality. To minimise administrative costs, Member States should be able to determine financial contributions towards the costs of cleaning up litter by setting appropriate multiannual fixed amounts.</p>

That system should, however, be supplemented by further financial incentives for fishermen to bring their waste fishing gear on shore to avoid any potential increase in the indirect waste fee to be paid. As plastic components of fishing gear have high recycling potential, Member States should, in line with the polluter-pays principle, introduce extended producer responsibility for fishing gear and components of fishing gear containing plastic to ensure separate collection of waste fishing gear and to finance environmentally sound waste management of waste fishing gear, in particular recycling.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products are one of the marine litter items that are found the most on beaches in the Union. This is due to ineffective separate collection systems and low participation in those systems by consumers. It is necessary to promote more effective separate collection systems. Therefore, a minimum separate collection target should be established for beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products. While the obligation to separately collect waste requires that waste be kept separate by type and nature, it should be possible to collect certain types of waste together provided that this does not impede high-quality recycling in line with the waste hierarchy in accordance with Article 10(2) and point (a) of Article 10(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC. The setting of the separate collection target should be based on the amount of single-use plastic beverage bottles placed on the market in a Member State or alternatively on the amount of waste single-use plastic beverage bottles generated in a Member State. The calculation of the amount of waste generated in a Member State should take due account of all waste single-use plastic beverage bottles generated, including those which become litter instead of being disposed of through waste collection systems. Member States should be able to achieve that minimum target by setting separate collection targets for beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products in the framework of the extended producer responsibility schemes, by establishing deposit-refund schemes or by any other measure that they find appropriate. That will have a direct, positive impact on the collection rate, the quality of the collected material and the quality of the recyclates, offering opportunities for the recycling business and the market for the recyclates. It will support reaching the recycling targets for packaging waste set in Directive 94/62/EC.</p>
