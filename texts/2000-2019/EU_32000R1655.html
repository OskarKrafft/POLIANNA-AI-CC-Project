      <p class="normal">The Commission notes the agreement of the European Parliament and the Council to provide for a regulatory procedure when considering the choice of projects, as opposed to the management procedure proposed by the Commission in the modified proposal following Parliament's second reading.</p>
      <p class="normal">The Commission insists, as it stated at the time of the adoption of the Common Position, on the importance of applying the criteria of Article 2 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.</p>
      <p class="normal">The Commission believes that, the choice of projects being a measure with substantial budgetary implications, this should follow the management procedure.</p>
      <p class="normal">The Commission considers that to ignore the terms of Article 2 of Decision 1999/468/EC in a case as clear as this is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Council Decision.</p>
      <p class="normal">The Commission must therefore reserve its position in this matter, including its right to take appropriate future action before the Court.</p>

      <p class="normal">The Council notes the statement by the Commission regarding the choice of the committee procedure for the adoption, by the Commission, of implementing measures under the LIFE Regulation.</p>
      <p class="normal">In choosing the regulatory procedure contained in Article 5 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, the Council took into account the experience gained with the regulatory procedure under the LIFE instrument during the first (since 1992) and second phase (since 1996) and the nature of the LIFE instrument, which plays a vital role in the protection of the environment within the Community and contributes to the implementation and development of Community environmental policy.</p>
      <p class="normal">The Council recalls that the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Decision 1999/468/EC are legally non-binding and of an illustrative nature. The Council considers that the scope of the implementing powers in this Regulation fully justify having recourse to a regulatory procedure.</p>
