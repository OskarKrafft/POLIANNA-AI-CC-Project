It proposed, in particular, to launch a European Defence Fund (the ‘Fund’) to support investment in joint research and in the joint development of defence equipment and technologies, thereby encouraging joint procurement and joint maintenance of defence equipment and technologies. The Fund would not replace national efforts in this regard and should act as an incentive for Member States to cooperate and invest more in defence. The Fund would support cooperation during the whole cycle of defence product and technology development, thereby fostering synergies and cost effectiveness. The objective would be to deliver capabilities, ensure a competitive and innovative basis for the defence industry across the Union, including by cross-border cooperation and participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to contribute to greater European defence cooperation.</p>

The Programme should aim to enhance the competitiveness of the Union's defence industry, contributing to the improvement of defence capabilities, inter alia, in relation to cyber defence, by supporting cooperation between undertakings throughout the Union, including SMEs and middle capitalisation companies (mid-caps), research centres and universities, and collaboration between Member States, in the development phase of defence products and technologies, thus facilitating better exploitation of economies of scale in the defence industry and promoting the standardisation of defence systems while improving their interoperability. The development phase, which follows the research and technology phase, entails significant risks and costs that hamper the further exploitation of the results of research and adversely impact the competitiveness of the Union's defence industry. By supporting the development phase, the Programme would contribute to a better exploitation of the results of defence research and would help to cover the gap between research and production. It would also promote all forms of innovation, since the positive effects of such support can be expected to spill over into the civilian sector. The Programme complements activities carried out in accordance with Article 182 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and it does not cover the production or procurement of defence products or technologies.</p>

In that context, the Programme could also help identify where the Union is dependent on third countries for the development of defence products and technologies. Such promotion of innovation and technological development should also take place in a manner consistent with the security and defence interests of the Union. Accordingly, an action's contribution to those interests and to the defence capability priorities agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy should serve as an award criterion. Within the Union, common defence capability priorities are identified in particular through the Capability Development Plan. Other Union processes such as the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence and the Permanent Structured Cooperation support the implementation of relevant priorities through enhanced cooperation. Where appropriate, regional and international priorities, including those in the NATO context, may also be taken into account, on condition that they serve the Union's security and defence interests and do not prevent any Member State from participating, while also taking account of the need to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
