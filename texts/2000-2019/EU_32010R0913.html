To that end, the coordinated development of the networks is necessary, and in particular as regards the integration of the international corridors for rail freight into the existing TEN-T and the ERTMS corridors. Furthermore, harmonising rules relating to those freight corridors should be established at Union level. Projects aimed at reducing noise from freight trains should be encouraged. If necessary, the establishment of those corridors should be supported financially within the framework of the TEN-T, research and Marco Polo programmes, and other Union policies and funds, such as the European Regional Development Fund or the Cohesion Fund as well as the European Investment Bank.</p>
