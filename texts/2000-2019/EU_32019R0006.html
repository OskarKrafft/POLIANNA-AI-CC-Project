                           <p class="oj-normal">Experience has shown that the needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the human sector in relation to medicinal products. In particular, the drivers for investment in markets for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products are different. For example, in the veterinary sector there are many different animal species, which creates both a fragmented market and the need for major investments in order to extend the authorisation of veterinary medicinal products existing for one animal species to another. Moreover, the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector follow a completely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary medicinal products are typically substantially lower than for medicinal products for human use. The size of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small fraction of the size of the pharmaceutical industry for medicinal products for human use. It is therefore appropriate to develop a regulatory framework addressing the characteristics and specificities of the veterinary sector, which cannot be considered as a model for the market for medicinal products for human use.</p>

Instead, there should be a possibility for Member States to decide at national level on whether or not to adopt a system for identification codes to be added to the information on the outer packaging of the veterinary medicinal products.</p>

The impact of animal diseases and the measures necessary to control them can be devastating for individual animals, animal populations, animal keepers and the economy. Animal diseases transmissible to humans can also have a significant impact on public health. Therefore sufficient and effective veterinary medicinal products should be available in the Union in order to ensure high standards of public and animal health, and for the development of the agriculture and aquaculture sectors.</p>

Therefore, where there is evidence that a constituent of a medicinal product, for which an application for a marketing authorisation for a generic veterinary medicinal product has been submitted, is a hazard for the environment, it is appropriate to require data on the potential effect on the environment in order to protect the environment. In such cases, applicants should endeavour to join efforts in generating such data in order to reduce costs and to reduce testing on vertebrate animals. The establishment of a single Union assessment of the environmental properties of active substances for veterinary use by means of an active substance-based review (‘monograph’) system could be a potential alternative. The Commission should therefore submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council which examines the feasibility of such a monograph system and other potential alternatives for environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicinal products, accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.</p>

Due to the complexity of the problem, its cross-border dimension and the high economic burden, its impact goes beyond its severe consequences for human and animal health and has become a global public health concern that affects the whole of society and requires urgent and coordinated intersectoral action in accordance with the ‘One Health’ approach. Such action includes strengthening of the prudent use of antimicrobials, avoiding their routine prophylactic and metaphylactic use, actions to restrict the use in animals of antimicrobials that are of critical importance for preventing or treating life-threatening infections in humans and encouraging and incentivising the development of new antimicrobials. It also needs to be ensured that appropriate warnings and guidance are included on the labels of veterinary antimicrobials. Use that is not covered by the terms of the marketing authorisation of certain new or critically important antimicrobials for humans should be restricted in the veterinary sector. The rules for advertising veterinary antimicrobials should be tightened, and the authorisation requirements should sufficiently address the risks and benefits of antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products.</p>

Given the limited innovation in developing new antimicrobials, it is essential that the efficacy of existing antimicrobials be maintained for as long as possible. The use of antimicrobials in medicinal products that are used in animals may accelerate the emergence and spread of resistant micro-organisms and may compromise the effective use of the already limited number of existing antimicrobials to treat human infections. Therefore, the misuse of antimicrobials should not be allowed. Antimicrobial medicinal products should not be used for prophylaxis other than in well-defined cases for the administration to an individual animal or restricted number of animals when the risk for infection is very high or its consequences are likely to be severe. Antibiotic medicinal products should not be used for prophylaxis other than in exceptional cases only for the administration to an individual animal. Antimicrobial medicinal products should be used for metaphylaxis only when the risk of spread of an infection or of an infectious disease in a group of animals is high and where no appropriate alternatives are available. Such restrictions should allow the decrease of prophylactic and metaphylactic use in animals towards representing a smaller proportion of the total use of antimicrobials in animals.</p>

Veterinarians have a key role in ensuring prudent use of antimicrobials and consequently they should prescribe the antimicrobial medicinal products based on their knowledge of antimicrobial resistance, their epidemiological and clinical knowledge and their understanding of the risk factors for the individual animal or group of animals. In addition, the veterinarians should respect their professional code of conduct. Veterinarians should ensure that they are not in a situation of conflict of interest when prescribing medicinal products, while recognising their legitimate activity of retail in accordance with national law. In particular, veterinarians should not to be influenced, directly or indirectly, by economic incentives when prescribing those medicinal products. Furthermore, the supply of veterinary medicinal products by veterinarians should be restricted to the amount required for treatment of the animals under their care.</p>

It is therefore important that guidance on the prudent use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine be taken into account and further elaborated. The identification of risk factors and the development of criteria for the initiation of administration of antimicrobials, as well as the identification of alternative measures, could help in avoiding the unnecessary use of antimicrobial medicinal products, including through metaphylaxis. In addition, Member States should be allowed to take further restrictive measures to implement national policy on the prudent use of antimicrobials, provided that those measures do not unduly restrict the functioning of the internal market.</p>

Antimicrobial resistant organisms can spread to humans and animals in the Union and third countries through consumption of products of animal origin from the Union or from third countries, from direct contact with animals or humans or by other means. Therefore, measures restricting the use of veterinary antimicrobials in the Union should be based on scientific advice and should be considered in the context of cooperation with third countries and international organisations. For those reasons, it should also be ensured, in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner, that operators in third countries respect certain basic conditions relating to antimicrobial resistance for animals and products of animal origin exported to the Union. Any such action should respect Union obligations under relevant international agreements. This should contribute to the international fight against antimicrobial resistance, in particular in line with the WHO Global Action Plan and the OIE Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance and the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials.</p>

It is therefore important to continue the collection of such data and further develop it in line with a stepwise approach. That data, when available, should be analysed with data on the use of antimicrobials in humans and data on antimicrobial resistant organisms found in animals, humans and food. To ensure that the data collected can be used effectively, appropriate technical rules should be laid down concerning the collection and the exchange of data. The Member States should be responsible for collecting data on the sales and use of antimicrobials used in animals under the coordination of the Agency. It should be possible to make further adjustments to the obligations on data collection when the procedures in the Member States for the collection of data on sales and use of antimicrobials are sufficiently reliable.</p>

The Court of Justice has also held that health and life of humans rank foremost among the assets and interests protected by the TFEU and that it is for Member States to determine the level of protection which they wish to afford to public health and the way in which that level has to be achieved. Since that level may vary from one Member State to another, Member States are to be allowed some discretion as regards the conditions for the supply on their territory of medicinal products to the public. Member States should be able, therefore, to subject the supply of medicinal products offered for sale at a distance by means of information society services to conditions justified by the protection of public or animal health. Such conditions should not unduly restrict the functioning of the internal market. In that context, Member States should be able to subject the supply of veterinary medicinal products offered for retail to stricter conditions justified by the protection of public or animal health or of environment, provided that those conditions are proportionate to the risk and do not unduly restrict the functioning of the internal market.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The dossier shall include particulars relating to the product control tests that may be carried out at an intermediate stage of the manufacturing process, with a view to ensuring the consistency of the technical characteristics and the production process.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">These tests are essential for checking the conformity of the veterinary medicinal product with the formula when, exceptionally, an applicant proposes an analytical method for testing the finished product which does not include the assay of all the active substances (or of all the excipient components subject to the same requirements as the active substances).</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The same applies where the quality control of the finished product depends on in-process control tests, particularly if the substance is essentially defined by its manufacturing method.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Where an intermediate product may be stored prior to further processing or primary assembly, a shelf life for the intermediate product shall be defined on the basis of the data resulting from stability studies.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e799-126-1">E.   TESTS ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">For the control of the finished product, a batch of a finished product comprises all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial quantity of material and have undergone the same series of manufacturing and/or sterilisation operations or, in the case of a continuous production process, all the units manufactured in a given period of time.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The application for marketing authorisation shall list those tests, which are carried out routinely on each batch of finished product. The frequency of the tests which are not carried out routinely shall be stated. Release limits shall be indicated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The dossier shall include particulars relating to control tests on the finished product at release. They shall be submitted in accordance with the following requirements.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The provisions of the relevant monographs and general chapters of the <span class="oj-italic">European Pharmacopoeia</span>, or failing that, of a Member State, shall be applicable to all products defined therein.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">If test procedures and limits other than those mentioned in the relevant monographs and general chapters of the <span class="oj-italic">European Pharmacopoeia</span>, or failing this, in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State are used, this shall be justified by providing proof that the finished product would, if tested in accordance with those monographs, meet the quality requirements of that pharmacopoeia for the pharmaceutical form concerned.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e823-126-1">1.   <span class="oj-bold">General characteristics of the finished product</span>
            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Certain tests of the general characteristics of a product shall always be included among the tests on the finished product. These tests shall, wherever applicable, relate to the control of average masses and maximum deviations, to mechanical, physical or microbiological tests, organoleptic characteristics, physical characteristics such as density, pH, refractive index. For each of these characteristics, standards and tolerance limits shall be specified by the applicant in each particular case.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The conditions of the tests, where appropriate, the equipment/apparatus employed and the standards shall be described in precise details whenever they are not given in the <span class="oj-italic">European Pharmacopoeia</span> or the pharmacopoeia of the Member States; the same shall apply in cases where the methods prescribed by such pharmacopoeias are not applicable.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Furthermore, solid pharmaceutical forms having to be administered orally shall be subjected to in vitro studies on the liberation and dissolution rate of the active substance or substances, unless otherwise justified. Those studies shall also be carried out where administration is by another means if the competent authorities of the Member State concerned consider this necessary.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e841-126-1">2.   <span class="oj-bold">Identification and assay of active substance(s)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Identification and assay of the active substance(s) shall be carried out either in a representative sample from the production batch or in a number of dosage units analysed individually.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Unless there is appropriate justification, the maximum acceptable deviation in the active substance content of the finished product shall not exceed ± 5 % at the time of manufacture.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">On the basis of the stability tests, the manufacturer shall propose and justify maximum acceptable deviation limits in the active substance content of the finished product up to the end of the proposed shelf life.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In certain cases of particularly complex mixtures, where assay of active substances which are very numerous or present in very low amounts would necessitate an intricate investigation difficult to carry out in respect of each production batch, the assay of one or more active substances in the finished product may be omitted, on the express condition that such assays are made at intermediate stages in the production process. This simplified technique may not be extended to the characterisation of the substances concerned. It shall be supplemented by a method of quantitative evaluation, enabling the competent authority to have the conformity of the medicinal product with its specification verified after it has been placed on the market.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">An <span class="oj-italic">in vivo</span> or <span class="oj-italic">in vitro</span> biological assay shall be obligatory when physico-chemical methods cannot provide adequate information on the quality of the product. Such an assay shall, whenever possible, include reference materials and statistical analysis allowing calculation of confidence limits. Where these tests cannot be carried out on the finished product, they may be performed at an intermediate stage, as late as possible in the manufacturing process.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Where degradation occurs during manufacture of the finished product, the maximum acceptable levels of individual and total degradation products immediately following manufacture shall be indicated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Where the particulars given in Section B show that a significant overage of an active substance is employed in the manufacture of the medicinal product or where the stability data show that the assay of the active substance declines on storage, the description of the control tests on the finished product shall include, where appropriate, the chemical and, if necessary, the toxico-pharmacological investigation of the changes that this substance has undergone, and possibly the characterisation and/or assay of the degradation products.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e870-126-1">3.   <span class="oj-bold">Identification and assay of excipient components</span>
            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">An identification test and an upper and lower limit test shall be obligatory for each individual antimicrobiological preservative and for any excipient that is liable to affect the bioavailability of the active substance, unless the bioavailability is guaranteed by other appropriate tests. An identification test and an upper limit test shall be obligatory for any antioxidant and for any excipient liable to adversely affect physiological functions, with a lower limit test also included for antioxidants at time of release.</p>
            <p class="oj-ti-grseq-1" id="d1e881-126-1">4.   <span class="oj-bold">Safety tests</span>
            </p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Apart from the toxico-pharmacological tests submitted with the application for marketing authorisation, particulars of safety tests, such as sterility and bacterial endotoxins, shall be included in the analytical particulars wherever such tests must be undertaken as a matter of routine in order to verify the quality of the product.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">Where a finished product requires reconstitution or dilution prior to administration, details of the proposed shelf life and specification for the reconstituted/diluted product are required, supported by relevant stability data.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In the case of multi-dose containers, where relevant, stability data shall be presented to justify a shelf life for the product after it has been broached for the first time and an in-use specification shall be defined.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Where a finished product is liable to give rise to degradation products, the applicant shall declare these and indicate the identification methods and test procedures.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The conclusions shall contain the results of analyses, justifying the proposed shelf life and if appropriate, the in-use shelf life, under the recommended storage conditions and the specifications of the finished product at the end of the shelf life, and in-use shelf life if appropriate, of the finished product under these recommended storage conditions.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The maximum acceptable level of individual and total degradation products at the end of shelf life shall be indicated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">A study of the interaction between product and container shall be submitted wherever the risk of such interaction is regarded as possible, especially where injectable preparations are concerned.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">In the case of pharmacologically active substances or veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, the study of the effects on reproduction shall be performed in the form of a multi-generation reproduction study, designed to detect any effect on mammalian reproduction. These include effects on male and female fertility, mating, conception, implantation, ability to maintain pregnancy to term, parturition, lactation, survival, growth and development of the offspring from birth through to weaning, sexual maturity and the subsequent reproductive function of the offspring as adults.

These tests shall be designed to detect any adverse effects on the pregnant female and development of the embryo and foetus consequent to exposure of the female from implantation through gestation to the day before predicted birth. Such adverse effects include enhanced toxicity relative to that observed in non-pregnant females, embryo-foetal death, altered foetal growth, and structural changes to the foetus. A developmental toxicity test in the rat is required. Depending on the results, a study in a second species may have to be performed, in accordance with established guidance.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In the case of pharmacologically active substances or veterinary medicinal products not intended for use in food producing animals, a study of developmental toxicity shall be performed in at least one species, which may be the target species, if the product is intended for use in female animals which may be used for breeding. However, where the use of the veterinary medicinal product would result in significant exposure to users, standard developmental toxicity studies shall be performed.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">First, the mechanism of action and the pharmacological effects on which the recommended application in practice is based shall be adequately described. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms (using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc.) and, wherever possible, in comparison with a substance the activity of which is well known. Where a higher efficacy is being claimed for an active substance, the difference shall be demonstrated and shown to be statistically significant.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Secondly, an overall pharmacological assessment of the active substance shall be provided, with special reference to the possibility of secondary pharmacological effects. In general, the effects on the main body functions shall be investigated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Any effect of the other characteristics of the products (such as the route of administration or formulation) on the pharmacological activity of the active substance shall be investigated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The investigations shall be intensified where the recommended dose approaches a dose likely to produce adverse reactions.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The experimental techniques, unless they are standard procedures, shall be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator shall establish their validity. The experimental results shall be set out clearly and, for certain types of tests, their statistical significance quoted.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Unless good reasons are given to the contrary, any quantitative modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall also be investigated.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Fixed combinations may be prompted either on pharmacological grounds or by clinical indications. In the first case, the pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic studies shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combination itself of value in clinical use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the medicinal combination is sought through clinical experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals and, at least, the importance of any adverse reactions shall be checked. If a combination includes a new active substance, the latter shall have been previously studied in depth.</p>
