In particular, if the European political party or European political foundation acquires legal personality under the law of the Member State of its seat, this should be considered as a conversion of the European legal personality and any individual rights and obligations that the former European legal entity has respectively acquired or incurred should be transferred to the national legal entity. Moreover, in order to facilitate continuity of activity, safeguards should be put in place to prevent the Member State concerned from applying prohibitive conditions to such conversion. If the European political party or European political foundation does not acquire legal personality in the Member State of its seat, it should be wound up in accordance with the law of that Member State and in accordance with the condition requiring it not to pursue profit goals. The Authority and the Authorising Officer of the European Parliament should be able to agree modalities with the Member State concerned regarding the termination of the European legal personality, in particular in order to ensure the recovery of funds received from the general budget of the European Union and any financial sanctions.</p>

While it is crucial to ensure that the conditions applicable to becoming a European political party are not excessive but can readily be met by organised and serious transnational alliances of political parties or natural persons or both, it is also necessary to establish proportionate criteria in order to allocate limited resources from the general budget of the European Union which criteria objectively reflect the European ambition and genuine electoral support of a European political party. Such criteria are best based on the outcome of elections to the European Parliament, in which the European political parties or their members are required to participate under this Regulation, providing a precise indication of the electoral recognition of a European political party. These should reflect the European Parliament's role of directly representing the Union's citizens, assigned to it by Article 10(2) TEU, as well as the objective for European political parties to participate fully in the democratic life of the Union and to become actors in Europe's representative democracy, in order effectively to express the views, opinions and political will of the citizens of the Union. Eligibility for funding from the general budget of the European Union should therefore be limited to European political parties which are represented in the European Parliament by at least one of their members and to European political foundations which apply through a European political party that is represented in the European Parliament by at least one of its members.</p>
