In order to meet that objective, the overall global annual mean surface temperature increase should not exceed 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report shows that in order to reach that objective, global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak by 2020. This implies the increasing of efforts by the Community, the quick involvement of developed countries and encouraging the participation of developing countries in the emission reduction process.</p>

By 2050, global greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by at least 50 % below their 1990 levels. All sectors of the economy should contribute to achieving these emission reductions, including international maritime shipping and aviation. Aviation is contributing to these reductions through its inclusion in the Community scheme. In the event that no international agreement which includes international maritime emissions in its reduction targets through the International Maritime Organisation has been approved by the Member States or no such agreement through the UNFCCC has been approved by the Community by 31 December 2011, the Commission should make a proposal to include international maritime emissions according to harmonised modalities in the Community reduction commitment, with the aim of the proposed act entering into force by 2013. Such a proposal should minimise any negative impact on the Community’s competitiveness while taking into account the potential environmental benefits.</p>

Given that it anticipates a positive outcome to the COP 15 negotiations that will be held in Copenhagen in 2009, the European Union should begin to prepare tougher emission reduction targets for 2020 and beyond, and should seek to ensure that, after 2013, the Community scheme allows, if necessary, for more stringent emission caps, as part of the Union’s contribution to a future international agreement on climate change (hereinafter referred to as the international agreement on climate change).</p>

Furthermore, more predictability should be ensured and the scope of the system should be extended by including new sectors and gases with a view to both reinforcing a carbon price signal necessary to trigger the necessary investments and by offering new abatement opportunities, which will lead to lower overall abatement costs and the increased efficiency of the system.</p>

Hospitals may also be excluded if they undertake equivalent measures. This threshold offers the maximum gain, in relative terms, of reduction of administrative costs for each tonne of CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> equivalent excluded from the system, for reasons of administrative simplicity. As a consequence of the move from five-year allocation periods, and in order to increase certainty and predictability, provisions should be laid down regarding the frequency of revision of greenhouse gas emission permits. It is for Member States to propose measures applying to small installations which will achieve a contribution to emission reductions equivalent to those achieved by the Community scheme. Such measures could include taxation, agreements with industry and regulation. Taking into account the need to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens for smaller emitters, Member States may set up simplified procedures and measures to comply with this Directive.</p>

Provisions for the adoption of harmonised rules for the implementation of this Directive should therefore be included.

The objectives of eliminating distortions to intra-Community competition and of ensuring the highest degree of economic efficiency in the transformation of the Community economy towards a safe and sustainable low-carbon economy make it inappropriate to treat economic sectors differently under the Community scheme in individual Member States. It is therefore necessary to develop other mechanisms to support the efforts of those Member States with relatively lower income per capita and higher growth prospects. 88 % of the total quantity of allowances to be auctioned should be distributed amongst Member States according to their relative share of emissions in the Community scheme for 2005 or the average of the period from 2005 to 2007, whichever one is the highest. 10 % of the total quantity should be distributed to the benefit of certain Member States for the purpose of solidarity and growth in the Community, to be used to reduce emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. The distribution of this 10 % should take into account levels of income per capita in 2005 and the growth prospects of Member States, and be higher for Member States with low income levels per head and high growth prospects. Member States with an average level of income per capita that is more than 20 % higher than the average in the Community should contribute to this distribution, except where the direct costs of the overall package estimated in the Commission’s impact assessment accompanying the package of implementation measures for the EU’s objectives on climate change and renewable energy for 2020 exceed 0,7 % of GDP. A further 2 % of the total quantity of allowances to be auctioned should be distributed amongst Member States, the greenhouse gas emissions of which were, in 2005, at least 20 % below their emissions in the base year applicable to them under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

This proportion is significantly below the expected net revenues for public authorities from auctioning, taking into account potentially reduced income from corporate taxes. In addition, proceeds from the auctioning of allowances should be used to cover administrative expenses of the management of the Community scheme. This Directive should also include provisions on monitoring the use of funds from auctioning for these purposes.

Those rules should take account of the most greenhouse gas and energy-efficient techniques, substitutes, alternative production processes, use of biomass, renewables and CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> capture and storage. Any such rules should not give incentives to increase emissions and should ensure that an increasing proportion of these allowances is auctioned. Allocations must be fixed prior to the trading period so as to enable the market to function properly. Those harmonised rules may also take into account emissions related to the use of combustible waste gases when the production of these waste gases cannot be avoided in the industrial process. In this respect, the rules may provide for allowances to be allocated for free to operators of installations combusting the waste gases concerned or to operators of the installations where these gases originate. They should also avoid undue distortions of competition on the markets for electricity and heating and cooling supplied to industrial installations. Furthermore, they should avoid undue distortions of competition between industrial activities carried out in installations operated by a single operator and production in out sourced installations. Those rules should apply to new entrants carrying out the same activities as existing installations receiving transitional free allocations. To avoid any distortion of competition within the internal market, no free allocation should be made in respect of the production of electricity by new entrants. Allowances which remain in the new entrants’ reserve in 2020 should be auctioned.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The Community will continue to take the lead in the negotiation of an ambitious international agreement on climate change that will achieve the objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 °C and is encouraged by the progress made at the 13th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, and 3rd Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, held in Bali, Indonesia from 3-14 December 2007 towards this objective. In the event that other developed countries and other major emitters of greenhouse gases do not participate in this international agreement, this could lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in third countries where industry would not be subject to comparable carbon constraints (carbon leakage), and at the same time could put certain energy-intensive sectors and subsectors in the Community which are subject to international competition at an economic disadvantage. This could undermine the environmental integrity and benefit of actions by the Community. To address the risk of carbon leakage, the Community should allocate 100 % of allowances free of charge to sectors or subsectors meeting the relevant criteria. The definition of these sectors and subsectors and the measures required should be subject to reassessment to ensure that action is taken where necessary and to avoid overcompensation. For those specific sectors or subsectors where it can be duly substantiated that the risk of carbon leakage cannot be prevented otherwise, where electricity constitutes a high proportion of production costs and is produced efficiently, the action taken may take into account the electricity consumption in the production process, without changing the total quantity of allowances. The carbon leakage risk in these sectors or subsectors should be assessed, as a starting point, at a 3-digit level (NACE-3 code) or, where appropriate and where the relevant data are available, at a 4-digit level (NACE-4 code).</p>

In this context, the Commission should identify which energy-intensive industry sectors or subsectors are likely to be subject to carbon leakage by 31 December 2009. It should base its analysis on the assessment of the inability of industries to pass on the cost of required allowances in product prices without significant loss of market share to installations outside the Community which do not take comparable action to reduce their emissions. Energy-intensive industries which are determined to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage could receive a higher amount of free allocation or an effective carbon equalisation system could be introduced with a view to putting installations from the Community which are at significant risk of carbon leakage and those from third countries on a comparable footing. Such a system could apply requirements to importers that would be no less favourable than those applicable to installations within the Community, for example by requiring the surrender of allowances. Any action taken would need to be in conformity with the principles of the UNFCCC, in particular the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, taking into account the particular situation of least developed countries (LDCs). It would also need to be in conformity with the international obligations of the Community, including the obligations under the WTO agreement.</p>

The Kyoto Protocol sets out quantified emission targets for developed countries for the period from 2008 to 2012, and provides for the creation of certified emission reductions (CERs) from clean development mechanism (CDM) projects and emission reduction units (ERUs) from joint implementation (JI) projects and their use by developed countries to meet part of these targets. While the Kyoto framework does not enable ERUs to be created from 2013 onwards without new quantified emission targets being in place for host countries, CDM credits can potentially continue to be generated. Once there is an international agreement on climate change, additional use of CERs and ERUs should be provided for, from countries which have ratified that agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, providing for further use of CERs and ERUs would undermine this incentive and make it more difficult to achieve the objectives of the Community regarding the increase of renewable energy use. The use of CERs and ERUs should be consistent with the goal set by the Community of generating 20 % of energy from renewable sources by 2020, and promoting energy efficiency, innovation and technological development. Where it is consistent with achieving these goals, the possibility should be foreseen to conclude agreements with third countries to provide incentives for reductions in emissions in these countries which bring about real, additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while stimulating innovation by companies established within the Community and technological development in third countries. Such agreements may be ratified by more than one country. Upon the approval by the Community of a satisfactory international agreement on climate change, access to credits from projects in third countries should be increased simultaneously with the increase in the level of emission reductions to be achieved through the Community scheme.</p>

As Member States cannot carry over CERs and ERUs held by operators between commitment periods under international agreements (‘banking’ of CERs and ERUs) before 2015, and only if Member States choose to allow the banking of those CERs and ERUs within the context of limited rights to bank such credits, this certainty should be provided by requiring Member States to allow operators to exchange such CERs and ERUs issued in respect of emission reductions before 2012 for allowances valid from 2013 onwards. However, as Member States should not be obliged to accept CERs and ERUs which it is not certain they will be able to use towards their existing international commitments, this requirement should not extend beyond 31 March 2015. Operators should be provided with the same certainty concerning such CERs issued from projects that have been established before 2013 in respect of emission reductions from 2013 onwards. It is important that credits from projects used by operators represent real, verifiable, additional and permanent emission reductions and have clear sustainable development benefits and no significant negative environmental or social impacts. A procedure should be established which allows for the exclusion of certain project types.</p>

Given that very few CDM projects have been established in those countries, it is appropriate to provide certainty on the acceptance of credits from projects started in LDCs after 2012, even in the absence of an international agreement on climate change, when these projects are clearly additional and contribute to sustainable development.

                     <p class="oj-normal">2.   The thresholds values given below generally refer to production capacities or outputs. Where several activities falling under the same category are carried out in the same installation, the capacities of such activities are added together.</p>
                     <p class="oj-normal">3.   When the total rated thermal input of an installation is calculated in order to decide upon its inclusion in the Community scheme, the rated thermal inputs of all technical units which are part of it, in which fuels are combusted within the installation, are added together. These units could include all types of boilers, burners, turbines, heaters, furnaces, incinerators, calciners, kilns, ovens, dryers, engines, fuel cells, chemical looping combustion units, flares, and thermal or catalytic post-combustion units. Units with a rated thermal input under 3 MW and units which use exclusively biomass shall not be taken into account for the purposes of this calculation. “Units using exclusively biomass” includes units which use fossil fuels only during start-up or shut-down of the unit.</p>
                     <p class="oj-normal">4.   If a unit serves an activity for which the threshold is not expressed as total rated thermal input, the threshold of this activity shall take precedence for the decision about the inclusion in the Community scheme.</p>
                     <p class="oj-normal">5.   When the capacity threshold of any activity in this Annex is found to be exceeded in an installation, all units in which fuels are combusted, other than units for the incineration of hazardous or municipal waste, shall be included in the greenhouse gas emission permit.</p>
                     <p class="oj-normal">6.   From 1 January 2012 all flights which arrive at or depart from an aerodrome situated in the territory of a Member State to which the Treaty applies shall be included.</p>
