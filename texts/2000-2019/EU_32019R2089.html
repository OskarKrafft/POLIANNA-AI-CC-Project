                           <p class="oj-normal">Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 introduced a transitional period in which index providers providing benchmarks on 30 June 2016 are to apply for authorisation by 1 January 2020. The discontinuation of a critical benchmark could impact market integrity, financial stability, consumers, the real economy and the financing of households and businesses in Member States. The discontinuation of a critical benchmark could also affect the validity of financial contracts or financial instruments and could cause disruption to both investors and consumers, with potentially severe repercussions for financial stability. In addition, if input data for critical benchmarks were no longer available, this could undermine the representative nature of such benchmarks and could negatively impact the ability of such benchmarks to reflect the underlying market or economic reality. Therefore, the maximum period of the mandatory administration of critical benchmarks and the maximum period for mandatory contributions to such benchmarks should be extended to five years. Critical benchmarks are currently being reformed. Switching from an existing critical benchmark to an appropriate successor rate requires a transition period so that all legal and technical arrangements necessary for such a switch can be completed without disruption. During that transition period, the existing critical benchmark should be published alongside its successor rate. It is therefore necessary to extend the period during which an existing critical benchmark can be published and used without its administrator having applied for authorisation.</p>
