The Union is now in its fourth year of moderate recovery, with Gross Domestic Product growing at 2 % in 2015, but unemployment rates remain above their pre-crisis levels. The comprehensive efforts initiated with the Investment Plan are already delivering concrete results, despite the fact that it is not yet possible to estimate the full impact that the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) has had on growth as the macroeconomic effects of larger investment projects cannot be immediate. Investment has been picking up gradually throughout 2017 but the pace is still rather slow and remains below historical levels.</p>

The market response and absorption have been particularly quick under the SME window where the EFSI is delivering well beyond expectations and building on the initial use of the existing European Investment Fund (EIF) facilities and mandates (InnovFin SME Guarantee Facility, COSME Loan Guarantee Facility (LGF) and the EIB Risk Capital Resources (RCR) mandate) to have an accelerated kick-start. In July 2016, the SME window was therefore scaled-up by EUR 500 000 000 within the existing parameters of Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2017345EN.01003401-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2017345EN.01003401-E0004"

However, the drive to meet the headline target should not prevail over the additionality of the projects selected. The Union is therefore committed not only to extending the investment period and financial capacity of the EFSI, but also to increasing the focus on additionality. The extension covers the period of the current multiannual financial framework and should provide at least EUR 500 000 000 000 of investments by 2020. In order to enhance the firepower of the EFSI even further and to achieve the aim of doubling the investment target, Member States should also contribute as a matter of priority.</p>

Such investments include investments in the areas of energy, environment and climate action, social and human capital and related infrastructure, healthcare, research and innovation, cross-border and sustainable transport, as well as the digital transformation. In particular, the contribution of operations supported by the EFSI to achieving the ambitious Union targets set at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) and the Union commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 % should be reinforced. In order to reinforce the climate action element under the EFSI, the EIB should build on its experience as one of the largest providers of climate finance worldwide and use its state-of-the-art internationally agreed methodology to credibly identify climate action project components or cost shares. Projects should not be artificially structured with a view to falling under the definitions of SMEs and small mid-cap companies. Energy interconnection priority projects and energy efficiency projects should also be increasingly targeted.</p>

For reasons of clarity, although they are already eligible, it should be explicitly laid down that projects in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fishery and aquaculture and other elements of a wider bioeconomy fall within the general objectives eligible for EFSI support.</p>

Combination and/or blending aim to enhance the added value of Union spending by attracting additional resources from private investors and to ensure that the supported actions become economically and financially viable. To that end, EUR 1 000 000 000 of appropriations were transferred in parallel with the presentation of the Commission proposal for this Regulation from the CEF financial instruments to the grant part of the CEF with a view to facilitating blending with the EFSI. A blending call to that effect was successfully launched in February 2017. Another EUR 145 000 000 is being transferred to other relevant instruments, in particular those dedicated to energy efficiency. Further action is necessary to ensure that Union funds and EFSI support can be easily combined.</p>
