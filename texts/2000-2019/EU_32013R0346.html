In the absence of such a common framework, there is a risk that Member States take diverging measures at national level having a direct negative impact on, and creating obstacles to, the proper functioning of the internal market, since funds that wish to operate across the Union would be subject to different rules in different Member States. Moreover, diverging quality requirements on portfolio composition, investment targets and eligible investors could lead to different levels of investor protection and generate confusion as to the investment proposition associated with qualifying social entrepreneurship funds. Investors should, furthermore, be able to compare the investment propositions of different qualifying social entrepreneurship funds. It is necessary to remove significant obstacles to cross-border fundraising by qualifying social entrepreneurship funds, to avoid distortions of competition between those funds, and to prevent any further likely obstacles to trade and significant distortions of competition from arising in the future. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted by consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

This also ensures uniform conditions for the use of the designation by preventing diverging national requirements as a result of the transposition of a directive. Managers of collective investment undertakings that use the designation should follow the same rules across the Union, which will also boost the confidence of investors. This Regulation reduces regulatory complexity and the managers’ costs of compliance with often divergent national rules governing such funds, especially for those managers that want to raise capital on a cross-border basis. It also contributes to eliminating competitive distortions.</p>

It operates by providing goods and services for the market and uses its profits primarily to achieve social objectives.

A measurable and positive social impact could include the provision of services to immigrants who are otherwise excluded, or the reintegration of marginalised groups into the labour market by providing employment, training or other support. Social undertakings use their profits to achieve their primary social objective and are managed in an accountable and transparent way. Where, on an exceptional basis, a qualifying portfolio undertaking wishes to distribute profits to its shareholders and owners, it should have predefined procedures and rules on how profits are to be distributed. Those rules should specify that such distribution of profits does not undermine the primary social objective of the qualifying social portfolio undertaking.</p>

However, in order to have a sufficiently broad investor base for investments into qualifying social entrepreneurship funds it is also desirable that certain other investors have access to these funds, including high net worth individuals. For those other investors, specific safeguards should be laid down in order to ensure that qualifying social entrepreneurship funds are only marketed to investors that have the appropriate profile for making such investments. Those safeguards exclude marketing through the use of periodic savings plans. Furthermore, investments made by executives, directors or employees involved in the management of a manager of a qualifying social entrepreneurship fund should be possible when investing in the qualifying social entrepreneurship funds they manage, as such individuals are knowledgeable enough to participate in such investments.</p>

There are a wide range of different kinds of social outcomes or impacts that a social undertaking might target. Different ways of identifying and measuring the social outcomes or impacts have thereby developed. For instance, a firm that seeks to employ disadvantaged persons may report on the numbers of such persons employed who would not otherwise have been employed and a firm that seeks to improve the rehabilitation of prisoners may assess its performance in terms of recidivism rates. The funds aid the social undertakings in preparing and providing information on their goals and achievements, and gathering it for investors. While information about social outcomes and impacts is very important for investors, it is difficult to compare between different social undertakings and different funds both because of the differences in social outcomes or impacts targeted and because of the variety of approaches. In order to encourage the greatest consistency and comparability of such information in the longer term and the greatest efficiency in the procedures for obtaining the information, delegated acts should be developed in this area. Such delegated acts should also ensure greater clarity for supervisors, qualifying social entrepreneurship funds and social undertakings.</p>
