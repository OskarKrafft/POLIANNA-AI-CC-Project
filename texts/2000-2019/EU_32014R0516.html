There is a need to carry out removals in order to safeguard the integrity of the immigration and asylum policy of the Union and the immigration and asylum systems of the Member States. Thus, the possibility of removals is a prerequisite for ensuring that this policy is not undermined and for enforcing the rule of law, which itself is essential to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. The Fund should therefore support actions of Member States to facilitate removals in accordance with the standards laid down in Union law, where applicable, and with full respect for the fundamental rights and dignity of returnees.</p>

The principle of policy coherence for development, as set out in paragraph 35 of the European Consensus on Development, should be respected.
