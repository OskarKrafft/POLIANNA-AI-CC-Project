<p>Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 26 May 2003</p><p>on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC</p><p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) In connection with the harmonisation of approval procedures, it has become essential to bring the provisions of Council Directive 74/150/EEC of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors(4) into line with those of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5) and those of Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(6).</p><p>(2) Directive 74/150/EEC currently limits the scope of the Community type-approval procedure to wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. It is therefore also essential to extend its scope to other categories of agricultural or forestry vehicles. This Directive is therefore a first step towards the regulation of other agricultural motorised vehicles.</p><p>(3) Account should also be taken of the fact that an exemption procedure should be introduced for certain vehicles built in limited numbers, end-of-series vehicles, or those which take advantage of technical progress not covered by a separate directive.</p><p>(4) This Directive being based on the principle of total harmonisation, the period before EC type-approval becomes compulsory should be long enough to allow the manufacturers of those vehicles to adjust to the new harmonised procedures.</p><p>(5) As a result of Council Decision 97/836/EC of 27 November 1997 with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (Revised 1958 Agreement)(7), the various international regulations to which the Community has acceded must be complied with. Also, certain tests should be harmonised with those defined by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) codes.</p><p>(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).</p><p>(7) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as general principles of Community law.</p><p>(8) Directive 74/150/EEC has been variously and substantially amended, and should therefore be recast in the interests of clarity and rationality,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>Scope</p><p>1. This Directive applies to the type-approval of vehicles, whether built in one or more stages. It applies to vehicles defined in Article 2(d) having a maximum design speed of not less than 6 km/h.</p><p>This Directive also applies to the EC type-approval of the systems, components and separate technical units intended for use on such vehicles.</p><p>2. This Directive does not apply to:</p><p>(a) approval of single vehicles;</p><p>However, this procedure may apply to certain categories of vehicles which fall within the scope of this Directive and for which EC type-approval is obligatory;</p><p>(b) machinery that has been specially designed for forestry use, such as skidders and forwarders as defined in standard ISO 6814:2000;</p><p>(c) forestry machinery based on chassis for earthmoving equipment as defined in standard ISO 6165:2001;</p><p>(d) interchangeable machinery that is fully raised from the ground when the vehicle to which it is attached is in use on a road.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Directive:</p><p>(a) &quot;EC type-approval&quot; means the procedure whereby a Member State certifies that a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit satisfies the relevant technical requirements of this Directive; the EC type-approval of systems, components and separate technical units may also be referred to as &quot;EC component type-approval&quot;;</p><p>(b) &quot;multi-stage EC type-approval&quot; means the procedure whereby one or more Member States certify that, depending on the state of completion, an incomplete or completed vehicle type satisfies the relevant technical requirements of this Directive;</p><p>(c) &quot;approval of single vehicles&quot; means the procedure whereby a Member State certifies that a vehicle approved individually satisfies the national requirements;</p><p>(d) &quot;vehicle&quot; means any tractor, trailer or interchangeable towed machinery, whether complete, incomplete or completed, which is intended to be used in agriculture or forestry;</p><p>(e) &quot;vehicle category&quot; means any set of vehicles which have identical design characteristics;</p><p>(f) &quot;type of vehicle&quot; means vehicles of a particular category which do not differ in the essential respects referred to in Annex II, Chapter A;

trailers of which part of the load is borne by the drawing vehicle fall within this category; any vehicle coupled to a tractor and permanently incorporating an implement shall be assimilated to an agricultural or forestry trailer if the ratio of the technically permissible gross mass to the unladen mass of that vehicle is equal to or greater than 3,0 and if the vehicle has not been designed to process materials;</p><p>(l) &quot;interchangeable towed machinery&quot; means any instrument used in agriculture or forestry which is designed to be towed by a tractor and changes or adds to its functions; it may include a load platform designed and constructed to receive any tools and appliances needed for those purposes, and to store temporarily any materials produced or needed during work; any vehicle intended to be towed by a tractor and permanently incorporating an implement or designed to process materials shall be considered interchangeable towed machinery if the ratio of the technically permissible gross mass to the unladen mass of that vehicle is less than 3,0;</p><p>(m) &quot;system&quot; means a set of devices, combined to perform a specific function in a vehicle;</p><p>(n) &quot;component&quot; means a device, intended to be part of a vehicle, which may be type-approved independently of a vehicle;</p><p>(o) &quot;separate technical unit&quot;

The manufacturer shall submit an application for vehicle EC type-approval to the approval authority of a Member State. It shall be accompanied by an information folder containing the information required by Annex I.</p><p>With regard to the EC type-approval of systems, components and separate technical units, the information folder shall also be made available to the EC type-approval authority until EC type-approval is granted or refused.</p><p>2. In the case of multi-stage EC type-approval, the information to be supplied shall consist of:</p><p>(a) at stage one: those parts of the information folder and the EC type-approval certificates required for a complete vehicle which correspond to the state of completion of the base vehicle;</p><p>(b) at the second and subsequent stages: those parts of the information folder and the EC type-approval certificates which are relevant to the current stage of construction and a copy of the EC type-approval certificate for the incomplete vehicle issued at the previous stage; in addition, the manufacturer shall supply a detailed list of the changes and additions which he has made to the incomplete vehicle.</p><p>3. The manufacturer shall submit an application for EC type-approval of a system, component or separate technical unit to the EC type-approval authority in a Member State. It shall be accompanied by an information folder as required by the separate directive.</p><p>4. Applications for EC type-approval of a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit may be submitted to only a single Member State. A separate application shall be submitted for each type to be approved.</p><p></p><p>Article 4</p><p>The EC type-approval process</p><p>1. Each Member State shall grant:</p><p>(a) the EC type-approval to the vehicle types which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which, according to their category, meet the technical requirements of all the separate directives set out in Annex II, Chapter B;</p><p>(b) the multi-stage EC type-approval to incomplete or completed base vehicles which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements of all the separate directives set out in Annex II, Chapter B;</p><p>(c) system, component or separate technical unit EC type-approval to all types of systems, components or separate technical units which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements contained in the corresponding separate directive listed in Annex II, Chapter B.</p><p>Where the system, component or separate technical unit to be approved fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle, and where, for this reason, compliance with one or more requirements can be verified only when the system, component or separate technical unit to be approved operates in conjunction with other vehicle parts, whether real or simulated, the scope of the EC type-approval of the system, component or separate technical unit must be restricted accordingly.</p><p>In this case, the EC type-approval certificate for such a system, component or separate technical unit shall indicate any restrictions on its use and any conditions for fitting it. Observance of these restrictions and conditions shall be verified at the time of EC type-approval of the vehicle.</p><p>2. If a Member State finds that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which complies with the provisions of paragraph 1 is nevertheless a serious risk to road safety, the environment or occupational safety, it may refuse to grant EC type-approval. It shall forthwith notify the other Member States and the Commission thereof, stating the reasons on which its decision is based.</p><p>3. For each vehicle type in respect of which they have granted, refused to grant or withdrawn EC type-approval, the approval authority in each Member State shall send a copy of the EC type-approval certificate accompanied by the attachments specified in Chapter C of Annex II to the type-approval authorities in the other Member States within one month.</p><p>4. Each month, the EC type-approval authority in each Member State shall send a list containing the particulars shown in Annex VI of the EC type-approvals for systems, components or separate technical units which it has granted, refused to grant or withdrawn during the month in question to the EC type-approval authorities in the other Member States.</p><p>These authorities, on receiving an application from the EC type-approval authority in another Member State, shall immediately send it a copy of the EC type-approval certificate for the system, component or separate technical unit in question and/or an information package for each type of system, component or separate technical unit in respect of which it has issued, refused to issue or withdrawn EC type-approval.</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>Amendments to EC type-approvals</p><p>1. The Member State which has granted EC type-approval shall take the necessary measures to ensure that it is informed of any change in the particulars appearing in the information package.</p><p>2. An application for amendment of an EC type-approval shall be submitted exclusively to the Member State which granted the initial EC type-approval.</p><p>3. If, in the case of EC type-approval, any particulars appearing in the information package have changed, the EC type-approval authority in the Member State which granted the initial EC type-approval shall issue revised pages of the information package as necessary, marking each revised page to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of re-issue.</p><p>A consolidated, updated version of the information package, accompanied by a detailed description of the amendment, shall also be considered to meet this requirement.</p><p>4. Each time amended pages or a consolidated, updated version are issued, the index to the information package attached to the EC type-approval certificate shall also be amended to show the most recent dates of amendment, or the date of the consolidated, updated version.</p><p>5. The amendment shall be considered to be an &quot;extension&quot; and the type-approval authority in the Member State which granted the initial EC type-approval shall issue a revised EC type-approval certificate bearing an extension number that clearly states the reason for the extension and its date of re-issue in the following cases:</p><p>(a) if further inspections are required;</p><p>(b) if any information in the EC type-approval certificate, with the exception of its attachments, has changed;</p><p>(c) if the requirements of a separate directive which applied on the date from which first entry into service is prohibited have changed since the date which currently appears in the vehicle EC type-approval certificate.</p><p>6. If the EC type-approval authority in the Member State which granted the initial EC type-approval finds that an amendment to an information package warrants further inspections or fresh tests or checks, it shall inform the manufacturer accordingly and shall issue the documents referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 only after carrying out tests or checks which have produced satisfactory results.</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>Certificate of conformity and EC type-approval mark</p><p>1. In his capacity as holder of a vehicle EC type-approval certificate, the manufacturer shall issue a certificate of conformity.</p><p>This certificate, specimens of which are given in Annex III, shall accompany each vehicle, whether complete or incomplete, manufactured in conformity with the approved vehicle type.</p><p>2. For purposes of vehicle taxation or registration, Member States may, after giving at least three months&#039; notice to the Commission and the other Member States, require particulars not mentioned in Annex III to be added to the certificate of conformity, provided such particulars are explicitly stated in the information package or can be derived from it by a simple calculation.</p><p>3. In his capacity as holder of an EC type-approval certificate for a system, component or separate technical unit, the manufacturer shall affix to each component or unit manufactured in conformity with the approved type the trade name or mark, the type and/or, if the separate directive so provides, the EC type-approval mark or number.</p><p>4. In his capacity as holder of an EC type-approval certificate which, in accordance with Article 4(1)(c), includes restrictions on the use of the system, component or separate technical unit in question, the manufacturer shall provide with each system, component or separate technical unit detailed information on these restrictions and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it.</p><p></p><p>Article 7</p><p>Registration, sale and entry into service</p><p>1. Each Member State shall register new type-approved vehicles, permit their sale or permit their entry into service on grounds relating to their construction and functioning only if they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity.</p><p>Each Member State shall permit the sale of incomplete vehicles but may refuse their permanent registration and entry into service until such time as they are completed.</p><p>2. Each Member State shall permit the sale or entry into service of systems, components or separate technical units only if these systems, components or separate technical units comply with the requirements of the corresponding separate directives and the requirements referred to in Article 6(3).</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>Exemptions</p><p>1. The requirements of Article 7(1) shall not apply to vehicles intended for use by the armed forces, civil protection, fire-fighting or public order services or to vehicles type-approved in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.</p><p>2. Each Member State may, at the request of the manufacturer, exempt the vehicles referred to in Articles 9, 10 and 11 from one or more of the provisions of one or more of the separate directives.</p><p>Every year, the Member States shall send the Commission and other Member States a list of the exemptions granted.</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>Vehicles produced in small series</p><p>For vehicles produced in small series, the number of vehicles registered, offered for sale or put into service each year in each Member State shall be limited to the maximum number of units indicated in Annex V, Section A.</p><p>Every year, the Member States shall send the Commission a list of the EC type-approvals of these vehicles. The Member State granting such an EC type-approval shall send a copy of the information documents and the EC type-approval certificate and all its attachments to the approval authorities in the other Member States designated by the manufacturer, stating the nature of the exemptions which have been granted. Within three months, these Member States shall decide whether they accept the EC type-approval for vehicles to be registered within their territory and, if so, for how many vehicles.</p><p></p><p>Article 10</p><p>End-of-series vehicles</p><p>1. For end-of-series vehicles, Member States may, at the request of the manufacturer, within the quantitative limits set out in Annex V, Section B, and for the limited period specified in the third subparagraph, register and permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles that conform to a type of vehicle the approval of which is no longer valid.</p><p>The first subparagraph shall apply solely to vehicles which:</p><p>(a) are on Community territory, and</p><p>(b) are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued when the EC type-approval of the vehicle in question was still valid, but which was not registered or placed in service before the said approval lost its validity.</p><p>This option shall be restricted to a period of 24 months for complete vehicles and 30 months for completed vehicles from the date of expiry of the EC type-approval.</p><p>2. In order to apply paragraph 1 to one or more types of vehicles in a specific category, their manufacturer must submit a request to the competent authorities in each Member State affected by the entry into service of that type of vehicle. The request must specify the technical and/or economic grounds on which it is based.</p><p>Within three months, these Member States shall decide whether or not to authorise the registration of the type of vehicle in question in their territory, and if so for how many vehicles.</p><p>Each Member State affected by the entry into service of these types of vehicles shall be responsible for ensuring that their manufacturer complies with Annex V, Section B.</p><p></p><p>Article 11</p><p>Incompatibility of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units</p><p>For vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units designed in accordance with techniques or principles that are incompatible with one or more of the requirements of one or more of the separate directives:</p><p>(a) a Member State may grant a provisional EC type-approval. In this case, it must, within one month, send a copy of the EC type-approval certificate and its attachments to the approval authorities in the other Member States and to the Commission. At the same time, it shall send the Commission a request for authorisation to grant EC type-approval under this Directive.</p><p>That request must be accompanied by a file containing the following information:</p><p>(i) the reasons for which the techniques or principles at issue make the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit incompatible with the requirements of one or more of the relevant separate directives;</p><p>(ii) a description of the safety, environmental protection or occupational safety issues raised and of the action taken;</p><p>(iii) a description of the tests, together with their results, which show that the level of safety, environmental protection and occupational safety guaranteed is at least equivalent to that guaranteed by the requirements of one or more of the relevant separate directives;</p><p>(b) within three months of receipt of the complete file, the Commission shall submit a draft decision to the committee referred to in Article 20(1). In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 20(2), the Commission shall decide whether or not to authorise the Member State to grant an EC type-approval under this Directive.</p><p>Only the request for an authorisation and the draft decision shall be sent to the Member States in their national language(s);</p><p>(c) if the request is approved, the Member State may grant an EC type-approval under this Directive. In this case, the decision must also state whether restrictions are to be imposed on the validity of such EC type-approvals. In no case shall the period of validity of the EC type-approval be less than 36 months;</p><p>(d) where the separate directives have been adapted to technical progress in such a way that the types of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units approved under this Article comply with the amended directives, the Member States shall convert those EC type-approvals into EC type-approvals which comply with this Directive, allowing the time needed for the necessary changes to components or separate technical units, in particular, the removal of any references to restrictions or exemptions;</p><p>(e) if the action needed to adapt the specific separate directives has not been taken, the validity of the EC type-approvals granted under this Article may be extended, at the request of the Member State having granted the EC type-approval, by means of another Commission decision;</p><p>(f) an exemption granted for the first time under this Article can serve as a reference for the Committee referred to in Article 20(1) for further, identical requests.</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Equivalence</p><p>1. Acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, the Council may acknowledge equivalence between the conditions or provisions for EC type-approval of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units established by this Directive together with the separate directives, and the procedures established by international regulations or regulations of third countries in the framework of multilateral agreements or bilateral agreements between the Community and third countries.</p><p>2. The equivalence of EC type-approvals issued on the basis of the separate directives on motor vehicles as defined in Directive 70/156/EEC and set out in Annex II, Chapter B, Part II-A, to this Directive, is acknowledged.</p><p>3. The equivalence of type-approvals issued on the basis of the UN/ECE regulations which are annexed to the revised 1958 Agreement set out in Annex II, Chapter B, Part II-B, to this Directive, is acknowledged.</p><p>4. The equivalence of the test bulletins issued on the basis of the standardised OECD codes set out in Annex II, Chapter B, Part II-C, to this Directive is acknowledged as an alternative to the test reports drawn up under the separate directives.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>Arrangements to ensure conformity of production</p><p>1. A Member State granting an EC type-approval shall take the measures referred to in Annex IV in relation to that approval to verify, where appropriate in cooperation with the EC type-approval authorities in the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced conform to the approved type.</p><p>2. A Member State which has granted an EC type-approval shall take the measures referred to in Annex IV in relation to that approval to verify, where appropriate in cooperation with the EC type-approval authorities in the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be adequate and that the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced continue to conform to the approved type.</p><p>Verification to ensure that products conform to the approved type shall be limited to the procedures set out in Section 2 of Annex IV.</p><p></p><p>Article 14</p><p>Obligation to provide information</p><p>The competent EC type-approval authorities in the Member States shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EC type-approval and of the reasons for any such measure.</p><p></p><p>Article 15</p><p>Safeguard clauses</p><p>1. If a Member State establishes that vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units of a particular type pose a serious risk to road safety or occupational safety although they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity or are properly marked, it may, for a maximum period of six months, refuse to register such vehicles or prohibit the sale or entry into service in its territory of such vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units.</p><p>It shall forthwith notify the other Member States and the Commission thereof, stating the reasons on which its decision is based.</p><p>2.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT</p><p>1.1. Before granting EC type-approval, the EC type-approval authority in a Member State shall verify the existence of satisfactory arrangements and procedures for ensuring effective checking that components, systems, separate technical units or vehicles in production conform to the approved type.</p><p>1.2. The requirement in point 1.1 must be verified to the satisfaction of the authority granting EC type-approval. This verification may be carried out on behalf of the authority granting EC type-approval by the EC type-approval authority in another Member State. In this case, the latter authority shall prepare a statement of compliance outlining the areas and production facilities it considers to be relevant to the product(s) to be type-approved.</p><p>1.3. The EC type-approval authority shall accept the manufacturer&#039;s certification to harmonised standard EN ISO 9001:2000 with the permissible exclusion of the requirements related to the concepts of design and development, point 7.3 &quot;Customer satisfaction and continual improvement&quot; (the scope of which covers the product(s) to be type-approved) or an equivalent accreditation standard as satisfying the requirements of paragraph 1.1. The manufacturer shall provide details of the registration and undertake to inform the approval authorities of any amendments to its validity or scope.</p><p>1.4. On receiving a request from the authority of another Member State, the EC type-approval authority shall forthwith send the statement of compliance referred to in paragraph 1.2 or advise that it is not in a position to provide such a statement.</p><p>2. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION</p><p>2.1. Every vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit type-approved pursuant to this Directive or a separate directive must be so manufactured as to conform to the type approved by meeting the requirements of this Directive or of a separate directive appearing in the exhaustive list set out in Annex II, Chapter B.</p><p>2.2. When granting EC type-approval, the EC type-approval authority in a Member State shall verify the existence of adequate arrangements and documented control plans, to be agreed with the manufacturer for each EC type-approval, for the carrying-out at specified intervals of the tests or associated checks that are needed to verify continued conformity to the approved type, including, where applicable, tests required by the separate directives.</p><p>2.3. The holder of the EC type-approval must, in particular:</p><p>2.3.1. ensure the existence of procedures for effectively monitoring that products (vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units) conform to the EC type-approval;</p><p>2.3.2. have access to the testing equipment necessary for checking conformity to each approved type;</p><p>2.3.3. ensure that test results are recorded and that the attachments remain available for a period to be determined in agreement with the EC type-approval authority; this period shall not be greater than 10 years;</p><p>2.3.4. analyse the results of each type of test in order to verify and ensure the stability of the product characteristics, subject to the tolerances inherent in industrial production;</p><p>2.3.5. ensure that for each type of product at least the checks prescribed in this Directive and the tests prescribed in the applicable separate directives appearing in the exhaustive list set out in Annex II are carried out;</p><p>2.3.6. ensure that if any set of samples or test pieces is found not to conform at the end of the test in question, further samples are taken and the tests are repeated. All necessary steps shall be taken to restore conformity of the corresponding production.</p><p>2.3.7. In the case of EC vehicle type-approval, the checks referred to in point 2.3.5 shall be restricted to those verifying compliance with the specifications set out in the EC type-approval.</p><p>2.4. The authority which granted EC type-approval may at any time verify the conformity control methods applied in each production facility. The normal frequency of these verifications shall be in line with the arrangements (if any) accepted under paragraph 1.2 or 1.3 of this Annex and ensure that the relevant checks are reviewed over a period appropriate to the confidence required by the competent authority.</p><p>2.4.1. At every inspection, the test records and production records shall be made available to the visiting inspector.</p><p>2.4.2. Where the nature of the test so permits, the inspector may select samples at random to be tested in the manufacturer&#039;s laboratory (or in the laboratories of the testing body where a separate directive so provides). The minimum number of samples may be determined according to the results of the manufacturer&#039;s own verification.</p><p>2.4.3. Where the level of monitoring is unsatisfactory, or where it seems necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out under point 2.4.2, the inspector shall select samples to be sent to the testing body which conducted the EC type-approval tests.</p><p>2.4.4. The EC type-approval authority may carry out any check or test required by this Directive or in the relevant separate directives appearing in the exhaustive list set out in Annex II, Chapter B.</p><p>2.4.5. Where unsatisfactory results are found during an inspection, the EC type-approval authority shall ensure that all necessary steps are taken to restore conformity of production as rapidly as possible.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX V</p><p></p><p>A - SMALL SERIES LIMITS</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>B - LIMITS FOR END-OF-SERIES VEHICLES</p><p>The maximum number of vehicles of one or several types entering service in each Member State, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 10, must not exceed 10 % of the number of vehicles of all the types concerned which entered service in the two preceding years in the Member State in question; however, it may not be less than 20.</p><p>Vehicles entering service in accordance with this procedure shall be identified by a specific reference on the certificate of conformity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX VI</p><p></p><p>LIST OF EC TYPE-APPROVALS ISSUED UNDER SEPARATE DIRECTIVES</p><p>EC type-approval authority stamp</p><p>List number: ...</p><p>Covering the period ... to ...</p><p>The following information shall be provided in respect of each EC type-approval granted, refused or withdrawn during the abovementioned period:</p><p>Manufacturer: ...</p><p>EC type-approval number: ...</p><p>Make: ...</p><p>Type: ...</p><p>Date of issue: ...</p><p>First date of issue (in the case of extensions): ...</p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX VII</p><p></p><p>PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING MULTI-STAGE EC TYPE-APPROVAL</p><p>1. GENERAL</p><p>1.1. The satisfactory operation of the multi-stage EC type-approval process requires concerted action by all the manufacturers concerned. To this end, before granting an initial or subsequent stage EC type-approval, the EC type-approval authority shall ensure that the relevant manufacturers have made suitable arrangements for the supply and interchange of documents and information such that the completed vehicle meets the technical requirements of all the relevant separate directives as set out in Annex II, Chapter B.</p><p>Such information must include details of relevant system, component and separate-technical-unit EC type-approvals and of vehicle parts which form part of the incomplete vehicle but are not yet type-approved.</p><p>1.2. EC type-approvals in accordance with this Annex are granted on the basis of the current state of completion of the vehicle type and incorporate all EC type-approvals granted at the previous stage.</p><p>1.3. Each manufacturer in a multi-stage EC type-approval process shall be responsible for the EC type-approval and conformity of production of all systems, components and separate technical units manufactured by him or added by him to the previously built stage. He shall not be responsible for aspects which have been type-approved in an earlier stage unless he modifies vehicle parts to such an extent that the previously granted EC type-approval becomes invalid.</p><p>2.
