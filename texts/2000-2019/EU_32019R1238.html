By channelling more of Europeans’ savings from cash and bank deposits to long-term investment products, such as voluntary pension products with a long-term retirement nature, the impact would therefore be beneficial both for individuals (who would benefit from higher returns and improved pension adequacy) and for the broader economy.</p>

In others, personal pension products are available, but there is a high degree of fragmentation between national markets. As a result, personal pension products have only a limited degree of portability. This can result in difficulties for individuals to make use of their basic freedoms. For instance, they might be prevented from taking up a job or retiring in another Member State. In addition, the possibility for providers to use the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services is hampered by the lack of standardisation of existing personal pension products.</p>

The harmonisation of those core features will improve the level playing field for personal pension providers at large and help boost the completion of the CMU and the integration of the internal market for personal pensions. It will lead to the creation of a largely standardised pan-European product, available in all Member States, empowering consumers to make full use of the internal market by transferring their pension rights abroad and offering a broader choice between different types of providers, including in a cross-border way. As a result of fewer barriers to the provision of pension services across borders, a PEPP will increase competition between providers on a pan-European basis and create economies of scale that should benefit savers.</p>

The adoption of a regulation has been preferred as it would become directly applicable in all Member States. Therefore, a regulation would allow a quicker uptake of the PEPP and contribute more rapidly to address the need for more pension savings and investments in the CMU context. This Regulation is harmonising the core features of PEPPs which do not have to be subject to specific national rules and so, a regulation appears better suited than a directive in this case.

In some Member States, those institutions are only allowed to carry out occupational pension activities whereas in other Member States, those institutions, including the authorised entities responsible for operating them and acting on their behalf, where IORPs do not have legal personality, are allowed to carry out occupational and personal pension activities. This has not only lead to different organisational structures of IORPs but is also accompanied by different supervision on national level. In particular, prudential supervision of IORPs which are authorised to provide occupational and personal pension activities is broader than of those IORPs which only carry out occupational pension activities.</p>

Moreover and to further safeguard financial stability, all assets and liabilities corresponding to the PEPP provision business should be ring-fenced, without any possibility to transfer them to the other retirement provision business of the institution. IORPs that provide PEPPs should also at all times comply with the relevant standards set by Directive (EU) 2016/2341, including the more detailed investment rules laid down by the Member States where they are registered or authorised in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2341 when transposing that Directive, and the provisions of their system of governance. As with other PEPP providers, when this Regulation lays down more stringent provisions, such provisions should apply.</p>

Such instruments are non-transferable securities and therefore do not have access to the liquidity of secondary markets. They often require fixed term commitments which restrict their marketability and should be understood to include participation and debt instruments in, and loans provided to, non-listed undertakings. Non-listed undertakings include infrastructure projects, unlisted companies seeking growth, real estate or other assets that could be suitable for long-term investment purposes. Low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure projects are often non-listed assets and rely on long-term credits for project financing. Considering the long-term nature of their liabilities, PEPP providers are encouraged to allocate a sufficient part of their asset portfolio to sustainable investments in the real economy with long-term economic benefits, in particular to infrastructure projects and corporates.</p>

After the initial choice made upon the subscription of a PEPP, the PEPP saver should have the possibility to modify that choice after a minimum of five years from the subscription of a PEPP or in case of subsequent modification, from the most recent modification of the investment option, so that sufficient stability is offered to providers for their long-term investment strategy whilst at the same time investor protection is ensured.

It could take the form of either a risk-mitigation technique consistent with the objective of allowing the PEPP saver to recoup the capital, or a guarantee on the capital invested. A risk-mitigation technique consistent with the objective to allow the PEPP saver to recoup the capital could be a conservative investment strategy or a life-cycle strategy which progressively reduces the overall risk exposure over time. Guarantees provided under the default investment option should at least cover the contributions during the accumulation phase after deduction of all fees and charges. Guarantees could also cover the fees and charges and could provide for full or partial coverage of inflation. A guarantee on the capital invested should be due at the start of the decumulation phase and during the decumulation phase, where applicable.</p>

While that limit should be fixed at 1 % of the accumulated capital, it would be appropriate to further specify the types of costs and fees to be taken into account by regulatory technical standards, in order to ensure a level playing field between different PEPP providers and different types of PEPPs with their particular cost and fee structures. The Commission should be empowered to adopt such regulatory technical standards which should be developed by EIOPA. In drawing up the draft regulatory technical standards, EIOPA should, in particular, consider the long-term nature of the PEPP, the different types of PEPPs and the cost-relevant factors linked to their specific features, so as to ensure a fair and equal treatment of the different PEPP providers and their products while taking into account the character of the Basic PEPP as a simple, cost-efficient and transparent product providing a sufficient long-term real investment return. Moreover, with the aim of preserving the long-term retirement nature of the product, the form of out-payments, in particular with respect to lifelong annuities, should be carefully assessed. Within that framework, in order to ensure that PEPP providers offering a capital guarantee benefit of a level playing field with other providers, EIOPA should duly take into account the structure of costs and fees. Furthermore, the percentage values for costs and fees should be regularly revised in order to ensure their continued adequacy taking into account any changes in the level of costs. The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010.</p>

Where the conditions are met, the competent authorities should be able to impose a prohibition or restriction on a precautionary basis before a PEPP has been marketed, distributed or sold to PEPP savers. Those powers do not relieve the PEPP provider of its responsibility to comply with all the relevant requirements under this Regulation.</p>
