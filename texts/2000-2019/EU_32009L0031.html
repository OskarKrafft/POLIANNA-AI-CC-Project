In this context, Member States should in particular give due consideration to other energy-related options for the use of a potential storage site, including options which are strategic for the security of the Member State’s energy supply or for the development of renewable sources of energy. The selection of the appropriate storage site is crucial to ensure that the stored CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> will be completely and permanently contained. Member States should, in selecting storage sites, take account of their geological characteristics, for example seismicity, in the most objective and effective way possible. A site should therefore only be selected as a storage site, if there is no significant risk of leakage, and if in any case no significant environmental or health impacts are likely to occur. This should be determined through a characterisation and assessment of a potential storage complex pursuant to specific requirements.</p>
