A dedicated financial facility (the facility) should therefore be created to use the funding under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 which cannot be committed by the end of 2010. The creation of the facility should be considered in the light of the Sustainable Energy Financing Initiative proposed by the Commission. The facility should support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and facilitate the financing of investment projects related to energy efficiency and renewable energy by local, regional and national public authorities, in particular in urban settings. In this process, attention should be paid to synergies with other financial resources available in the Member States, such as the Structural and Cohesion Funds, the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) Facility and the European Regional Development Fund under Regulation (EC) No 397/2009 <a id="ntc4-L_2010346EN.01000501-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2010346EN.01000501-E0004"

The selection of such financial intermediaries should take place on the basis of their demonstrated ability to use the funding in the most efficient and effective way, with the objective of maximising the participation, within the shortest possible time, of other public and private investors and of achieving the highest leverage between the Union funding and the total investment with a view to raising significant investments in the Union. However, in times of financial and economic crises which have a particularly adverse effect on the finances of local and regional authorities, it should be ensured that the difficult budgetary situation of those authorities does not hinder them from being able to access the funding.</p>
