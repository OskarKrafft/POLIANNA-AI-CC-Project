Long-distance services (for instance night trains) are in difficulty and several of them have recently been withdrawn by the railway undertakings operating them in order to limit losses. The market for international high-speed services, on the other hand, has seen a sharp increase in traffic and will continue its vigorous development with the doubling and interconnection of the trans-European high-speed network by 2010. Nevertheless, there is strong competitive pressure from low-cost airlines in both cases. It is therefore essential to stimulate new initiatives by promoting competition between railway undertakings.</p>

The determination of whether that is the service’s principal purpose should take into account criteria such as the proportion of turnover, and of volume, derived from transport of domestic or international passengers, and the length of the service. This determination should be made by the respective national regulatory body at the request of an interested party.</p>
