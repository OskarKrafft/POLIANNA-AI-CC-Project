         <p class="normal">"The Commission recalls its December 2002 communication on a framework for European regulatory agencies and its proposal for a Regulation establishing the European Railway Agency. The Commission believes, in accordance with European Parliament resolution of 13 January 2004 on the abovementioned communication, that a Board of limited size with members appointed by the Community's executives would ensure a better functioning of the Agency in an enlarged EU.</p>
         <p class="normal">In this respect, the Commission looks forward to receiving the Council's response to its communication on a framework for regulatory agencies. The Commission confirms its intention to present, when appropriate, a proposal on a framework for European agencies, which will also cover the composition of the Management Board."</p>
