However, temporary phasing out measures should be envisaged to permit United Kingdom road haulage operators to perform a limited number of additional operations within the territory of the Union in the context of operations between the United Kingdom and the Union. In the immediate aftermath of a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement, such measures should help to prevent disruptions to traffic flows, which are to be expected from additional controls of vehicles and their cargo, and ensuing threats to public order. They should help in alleviating, more particularly, the pressure on the border points, which are few in number and which are where such disruptions are most likely, as the vehicles do not need to return immediately. They should be proportionate, should not replicate the same level of rights as those enjoyed by Union road haulage operators under the rules of the internal market and should be progressively phased out in accordance with this Regulation.</p>

The United Kingdom will become a Contracting Party in its own right to the Interbus Agreement from 1 April 2019. However, the Interbus Agreement covers only occasional services and is, therefore, inadequate to address the disruptions ensuing from the withdrawal, given the high number of persons that would continue to seek to travel between the Union and the United Kingdom. A Protocol to the Interbus Agreement covering regular passenger transport services was negotiated between its Contracting Parties, but it is not expected to enter into force in time to offer a viable alternative solution to the current situation for the period immediately after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom. Therefore, for regular and special regular services of passenger transport by bus and coach, the current instruments do not address the needs of road transport of passengers between the Union and the United Kingdom. To mitigate an ensuing major disruption that could put public order at risk, it is therefore appropriate to allow United Kingdom carriers to carry passengers from the United Kingdom to the Union and vice versa provided the United Kingdom grants at least equivalent rights to EU carriers. Those rights granted under this Regulation should be limited to a short period of time, so as to allow the Protocol to the Interbus Agreement on regular services to enter into force and the United Kingdom to accede to that Protocol.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Cross-border coach and bus services between Ireland and Northern Ireland are of particular importance for communities living in the border regions, in view of ensuring basic connectivity between communities inter alia as part of the Common Travel Area. The picking up and setting down of passengers in regions on either side of the border supports the viability of those services. Therefore, the picking up and setting down of passengers by United Kingdom coach and bus service operators should continue to be authorised in the border regions of Ireland in the course of international passenger transport services by coach and bus between Ireland and Northern Ireland. These rights should be granted for a limited period of time (until 30 September 2019) to enable alternatives to be put in place.</p>

This Regulation should in any event cease to apply on 31 December 2019. The Union will therefore cease to exercise the competence exercised through this Regulation after that date. Without prejudice to other Union measures, and subject to compliance with those measures, that competence will, in accordance with Article 2(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’), again be exercised by the Member States thereafter. The respective competences of the Union and of the Member States with respect to the conclusion of international agreements in the area of road transport are to be determined in accordance with the Treaties and taking into account relevant Union legislation.</p>

Those Regulations already cover the part of a journey between a Member State and a third country on the territory of any Member State crossed in transit. It is, however, necessary to ensure, in such case, that Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 also apply to the part of the journey on the territory of the Member State of loading or unloading, and that Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 apply to the part of the journey on the territory of the Member State of picking up or setting down passengers. Such an extension aims at ensuring that Union operators can perform cross-trade operations to or from the United Kingdom, as well as additional stops in their operation of passenger transport,</p>
