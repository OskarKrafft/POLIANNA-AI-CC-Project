The promotion of good health at Union level is also an integral part of 'Europe 2020: A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth' ("the Europe 2020 Strategy"). Keeping people healthy and active longer and empowering them to take an active role in managing their health, will have positive overall effects on health, including a reduction of health inequalities, and a positive impact on quality of life, on productivity and competitiveness, while reducing pressures on national budgets. Support for, and recognition of, innovation, which has an impact on health, helps to take up the challenge of sustainability in the health sector in the context of demographic change; and action to reduce inequalities in health is important for the purposes of achieving 'inclusive growth'. It is appropriate in that context to establish the third Programme for the Union's action in the field of health (2014-2020) ('the Programme').</p>

In order to improve the health of the population in the Union and reduce health inequalities, it is essential not to focus only on physical health. According to the WHO, mental health problems account for almost 40 % of years lived with disability. Mental health problems are also wide-ranging, long-lasting and a source of discrimination, and contribute significantly to inequality in health. Moreover, the economic crisis affects factors determining mental health, as protective factors are weakened and risk factors increased.</p>

Chronic diseases are responsible for over 80 % of premature mortality in the Union. The Programme should identify, disseminate and promote the uptake of evidence-based and good practices for cost-effective health promotion and disease prevention measures focused in particular on the key risk factors, such as tobacco use, drug use, harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy dietary habits, obesity and physical inactivity, as well as on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis. Effective prevention would contribute to increasing the financial sustainability of healthcare systems. Operating within a gender sensitive framework, the Programme should contribute to disease prevention in all its aspects (primary, secondary and tertiary prevention) and throughout the lifetime of the Union's citizens, to health promotion and the fostering of supportive environments for healthy lifestyles, taking into account underlying factors of a social and environmental nature as well as the impact on health of certain disabilities.</p>

The exchange of good practices is a key instrument of that policy. Such exchange should enable national authorities to benefit from efficient solutions developed in other Member States, reduce duplication of efforts and increase value for money by promoting innovative solutions in the field of health. Therefore, the Programme should focus mainly on cooperation with the competent authorities that are responsible for health in the Member States and provide incentives for a wider participation of all Member States as recommended in the evaluations of the previous health programmes. In particular, Members States whose Gross National Income (GNI) per inhabitant is lower than 90 % of the Union average should be actively encouraged to participate in actions co-financed by the competent authorities that are responsible for health in the Member States or by bodies mandated by those competent authorities. Such actions should be considered to be of exceptional utility and, in particular, respond to the objective of facilitating the participation of Member States whose GNI per inhabitant is lower than 90 % of the Union average and making that participation wider. Further and appropriate non-financial support for the participation of those Member States in such actions, for example in terms of the application process, transfer of knowledge and uptake of expertise, should also be considered.</p>
