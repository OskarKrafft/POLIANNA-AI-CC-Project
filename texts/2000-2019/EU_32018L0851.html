That waste stream, however, is amongst the most complex ones to manage, and the way it is managed generally gives a good indication of the quality of the overall waste management system in a country. The challenges of municipal waste management result from its highly complex and mixed composition, direct proximity of the generated waste to citizens, a very high public visibility and its impact on the environment and human health. As a result, the management of municipal waste requires a highly complex system including an efficient collection scheme, an effective sorting system and a proper tracing of waste streams, the active engagement of citizens and businesses, an infrastructure adjusted to the specific waste composition, and an elaborate financing system. Countries which have developed efficient municipal waste management systems generally perform better in overall waste management, including the attainment of the recycling targets.</p>

The rules laid down in this Directive allow for waste management systems where the municipalities have the general responsibility for collecting municipal waste, for systems where such services are contracted out to private operators, or for any other type of allocation of responsibilities between public and private actors. The choice for any such systems, and whether or not to change them, remains the responsibility of Member States.</p>

Municipal waste is defined as waste from households and waste from other sources, such as retail, administration, education, health services, accommodation and food services, and other services and activities, which is similar in nature and composition to waste from households. Therefore, municipal waste includes, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span>, waste from park and garden maintenance, such as leaves, grass and tree clippings, and waste from market and street cleaning services, such as the content of litter containers and sweepings except materials such as sand, rock, mud or dust. Member States are to ensure that waste from large commerce and industry which is not similar to waste from households is not included in the scope of municipal waste. Waste from production, agriculture, forestry, fishing, construction and demolition, septic tanks and sewage network and treatment, and end-of-life vehicles are excluded from the scope of municipal waste. Municipal waste is to be understood as corresponding to the types of waste included in Chapter 15 01 and Chapter 20, with the exception of codes 20 02 02, 20 03 04 and 20 03 06, of the list of waste established by Commission Decision 2014/955/EU <a id="ntc8-L_2018150EN.01010901-E0008" href="#ntr8-L_2018150EN.01010901-E0008"

Waste falling under other chapters of that list is not to be considered as municipal waste except in cases where municipal waste undergoes treatment and is assigned codes listed in Chapter 19 of that list. Member States may use relevant categories in that list for statistical purposes. The definition of municipal waste in this Directive is introduced for the purposes of determining the scope of application of the preparing for re-use and recycling targets and their calculation rules. It is neutral with regard to the public or private status of the operator managing the waste and therefore includes waste from households and other sources that is managed by or on behalf of municipalities or directly by private operators.</p>

Such measures should include enforcement provisions to verify that waste that is considered to have ceased to be waste as a result of a recovery operation complies with the law of the Union on waste, chemicals and products, in particular prioritising waste streams that pose a higher risk to human health and the environment due to the nature and volume of those waste streams, waste that is subject to innovative recovery processes or waste that is recovered for subsequent further use in other Member States. Measures may also include the setting of a requirement on the operators recovering waste or holders of recovered waste materials to demonstrate compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 6(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC as amended by this Directive. In order to prevent illegal shipments of waste and to raise awareness among Member States and economic operators, there should be greater transparency about Member State approaches to end-of-waste status, in particular with regard to their case-by-case decisions and the result of verification by competent authorities, as well as the specific concerns of Member States and competent authorities about certain waste streams. The final determination whether the conditions laid down in Article 5 or in Article 6 of Directive 2008/98/EC as amended by this Directive are fulfilled remains the exclusive responsibility of the Member State based on all relevant information provided by the holder of the material or waste.</p>

They should also contribute to the incorporation of end-of-life costs into product prices and provide incentives for producers, when designing their products, to take better into account recyclability, reusability, reparability and the presence of hazardous substances. Overall, those requirements should improve the governance and transparency of extended producer responsibility schemes and reduce the possibility of conflicts of interest emerging between organisations implementing extended producer responsibility obligations on behalf of producers of products and waste operators that those organisations contract. The requirements should apply to both new and existing extended producer responsibility schemes. A transitional period is however necessary for existing extended producer responsibility schemes to adapt their structures and procedures to the new requirements.</p>

In order to ensure security of supply of those raw materials and in line with the Raw Materials Initiative established by the Commission in its communication of 4 November 2008 on ‘The raw materials initiative — meeting our critical needs for growth and jobs in Europe’ and the objectives and targets of the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, Member States should take measures to promote the re-use of products constituting the main sources of critical raw materials to prevent that those materials become waste. In that context, the Commission has established a list of such materials for the Union in its communication of 13 September 2017 on ‘the 2017 list of Critical Raw Materials for the EU’ and that list is subject to regular review.</p>

They should also include in their waste management plans nationally appropriate measures regarding collection, sorting and recovery of waste containing significant amounts of those raw materials. The measures should be included in the waste management plans when they are updated for the first time following the entry into force of this Directive. The Commission should provide information about the relevant product groups and waste streams at Union level.

Therefore, in line with the 7th Environment Action Programme, which calls for the development of non-toxic material cycles, it is necessary to promote measures to reduce the content of hazardous substances in materials and products, including recycled materials, and to ensure that sufficient information about the presence of hazardous substances and especially substances of very high concern is communicated throughout the whole life cycle of products and materials. In order to achieve those objectives, it is necessary to improve the coherence among the law of the Union on waste, on chemicals and on products and to provide a role for the European Chemicals Agency to ensure that the information about the presence of substances of very high concern is available throughout the whole life cycle of products and materials, including at the waste stage.</p>

Member States should also be allowed to deviate from the general obligation to separately collect waste in other duly justified cases, for instance where the separate collection of specific waste streams in remote and scarcely populated areas causes negative environmental impacts that outweigh its overall environmental benefits or entails disproportionate economic costs. When assessing any cases in which economic costs might be disproportionate, Member States should take into account the overall economic benefits of separate collection, including in terms of avoided direct costs and costs of adverse environmental and health impacts associated with the collection and treatment of mixed waste, revenues from sales of secondary raw materials and the possibility to develop markets for such materials, as well as contributions by waste producers and producers of products, which could further improve the cost-efficiency of waste management systems.</p>

The calculation of the recycling targets should be based on the weight of municipal waste which enters recycling. As a general rule, the actual measurement of the weight of municipal waste counted as recycled should be at the point where municipal waste enters the recycling operation. Nevertheless, in order to limit administrative burdens, Member States should, under strict conditions and by way of derogation from the general rule, be allowed to establish the weight of municipal waste recycled on the basis of measuring the output of any sorting operation. Losses of materials which occur before the waste enters the recycling operation, for instance due to sorting or other preliminary operations, should not be included in the waste amounts reported as recycled. Those losses can be established on the basis of electronic registries, technical specifications, detailed rules on the calculation of average loss rates for various waste streams or other equivalent measures. Member States should report on such measures in the quality check reports accompanying the data on waste recycling which they report to the Commission. The average loss rates should preferably be established at the level of individual sorting facilities and should be linked to the different main types of waste, different sources (such as household or commercial), different collection schemes and different types of sorting processes. Average loss rates should only be used in cases where no other reliable data are available, in particular in the context of shipment and export of waste. Losses in weight of materials or substances due to physical or chemical transformation processes inherent in the recycling operation whereby waste materials are actually reprocessed into products, materials or substances should not be deducted from the weight of the waste reported as recycled.</p>
