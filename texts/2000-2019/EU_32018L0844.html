Member States should seek a cost-efficient equilibrium between decarbonising energy supplies and reducing final energy consumption.

With those objectives in mind and considering the Union’s overall energy efficiency ambitions, it is essential that Member States specify the expected output of their long-term renovation strategies and monitor developments by setting domestic progress indicators, subject to national conditions and developments.</p>

Considering that every 1 % increase in energy savings reduces gas imports by 2,6 %, clear ambitions for renovation of the existing building stock are of great importance. Thus, efforts to increase the energy performance of buildings would contribute actively to the Union’s energy independence and, furthermore, have great potential to create jobs in the Union, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises. In that context, Member States should take into account the need for a clear link between their long-term renovation strategies and pertinent initiatives to promote skills development and education in the construction and energy efficiency sectors.</p>

Even cheap energy efficiency technical solutions with very short payback periods, such as hydraulic balancing of the heating system and the installation or replacement of thermostatic control valves, are insufficiently considered today. The provisions on inspections should be amended to ensure a better result from inspections. Those amendments should place the focus of inspections on central heating systems and air-conditioning systems, including where those systems are combined with ventilation systems. Those amendments should exclude small heating systems such as electric heaters and wood stoves when they fall below the thresholds for inspection pursuant to Directive 2010/31/EU as amended by this Directive.</p>

To make sure appropriate implementation takes place, the general framework for the calculation of the energy performance of buildings should be updated and the improved performance of the building envelope should be encouraged with the support of the work elaborated by CEN, under Commission mandate M/480. Member States are able to choose to further supplement this by providing additional numerical indicators, for example for the entire building’s overall energy use or greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
