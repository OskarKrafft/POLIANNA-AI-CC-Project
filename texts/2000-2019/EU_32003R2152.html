<p>Regulation (EC) No 2152/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 17 November 2003</p><p>concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus)</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) Forests have an important multifunctional role for society. Apart from their significant role in the development of rural areas, forests have a major value for nature conservation, play an important role in preserving the environment, are key elements of the carbon cycle and significant carbon sinks and represent a critical controlling factor of the hydrological cycle.</p><p>(2) The condition of forests can be seriously affected by natural factors such as extreme weather conditions, attacks from parasites and diseases or human influences such as climate change, fires and air pollution. Such threats can seriously distort and even destroy forests. Most natural and anthropogenic factors affecting forests can have cross-border effects.</p><p>(3) The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on a forestry strategy for the European Union stressed the need to protect the natural environment and the forest heritage, to manage forests sustainably and to support international and pan-European cooperation concerning the protection of forests, making reference to forest monitoring and the promotion of forests as carbon sinks. The Council, in its resolution of 15 December 1998 on a forestry strategy for the European Union(5), called upon the Commission to evaluate and improve continuously the effectiveness of the European monitoring system of forest health and to take into account all the potential impacts on forest ecosystems. It also called upon the Commission to pay special attention to the development of the Community forest fire information system, which enables the effectiveness of the protection measures against fires to be better assessed.</p><p>(4) Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the sixth Community environment action programme(6) identifies the need to base the drawing-up, implementation and evaluation of environmental policies on a knowledge-based approach and, in particular, the need for monitoring the multiple roles of forests in line with recommendations adopted by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe and the United Nations Forum on Forests and the Convention on Biodiversity and other forums.</p><p>(5) The Community and the Member States are committed to implementing internationally agreed activities relating to the conservation and protection of forests, in particular, the proposals for actions of the intergovernmental panel and Forum on Forests, the expanded work programme on forest biological diversity of the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p>(6) The Community has already addressed two of the causes adversely affecting forest ecosystem conditions by means of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 of 17 November 1986 on the protection of the Community&#039;s forests against atmospheric pollution(7) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 of 23 July 1992 on protection of the Community&#039;s forests against fire(8).</p><p>(7) Both regulations expired on 31 December 2002 and it is in the general interest of the Community to continue and further develop the monitoring activities established by those regulations by integrating them into a new scheme called &quot;Forest Focus&quot;.</p><p>(8) The scheme should be reconciled with existing national, European and international systems, having due regard for the Community&#039;s competence in respect of forests, in accordance with its forestry strategy and without prejudice to the principle of subsidiarity.</p><p>(9) Measures under the scheme concerning forest fire monitoring should complement those measures which are undertaken, in particular, pursuant to Council Decision 1999/847/EC of 9 December 1999 establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection(9), Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(10) and Council Regulation (EEC) No 1615/89 of 29 May 1989 establishing a European forestry information and communication system (EFICS)(11).</p><p>(10) The scheme should encourage the exchange of information on the condition of and harmful influences on forests in the Community and enable the evaluation of ongoing measures to promote conservation and protection of forests for the benefit of sustainable development, with particular emphasis on actions taken to reduce impacts negatively affecting forests.</p><p>(11) The protection of forest from fires is a matter of particular importance and urgency in order, inter alia, to fight against desertification and to avoid their negative effects on climate change. It is crucial to avoid any interruption of the actions put in place by Member States in accordance with the expired Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92. Therefore, this Regulation should cover preventive measures that are not supported by Regulation (EC) No 1257/99 and not included in national or regional rural development programmes.</p><p>(12) In order to promote a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between forests and the environment, the scheme should also include monitoring of other important factors such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration, climate change, soils and the protective function of forests. The scheme should therefore comprise actions in order to provide for a broader range of objectives and a flexible implementation, while building on the achievements made pursuant to Regulations (EEC) No 3528/86 and (EEC) No 2158/92. It should provide for appropriate, cost-efficient monitoring of forests and environmental interactions.</p><p>(13) The Member States should implement the scheme through national programmes to be approved by the Commission following a procedure to be set up.</p><p>(14) The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, should ensure the coordination, monitoring and development of the scheme and report on it, in particular to the Standing Forestry Committee set up by Council Decision 89/367/EEC(12).</p><p>(15) The monitoring of forests and environmental interactions can only provide reliable and comparable information to protect forests in the Community if data are collected on the basis of harmonised methods. Such comparable information at Community level would contribute towards the establishment of a platform containing spatial data deriving from various sources of common environmental information systems. It is therefore appropriate to prepare manuals laying down the methods to be used for monitoring the condition of forests, the format of the data and rules for data handling.</p><p>(16) The Commission should use the data collected under this scheme in relation to carbon sequestration, climate change and impact on biodiversity in order to contribute to the reporting commitments under the relevant conventions and protocols, consistently with their provisions. If problems of inconsistency arise, the Commission should take any possible action with a view to reaching a positive solution.</p><p>(17) The Commission and the Member States should cooperate with other international bodies in the field of forest monitoring at an international or pan-European level, and, in particular, the international cooperative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests (hereinafter referred to as &quot;ICP Forests&quot;), in order to promote conservation and protection of forests for the benefit of sustainable development.</p><p>(18) This Regulation lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(13), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.</p><p>(19) It is appropriate to determine the volume of the Community contribution to activities financed under the scheme.</p><p>(20) In order to ensure the continuity of monitoring activities there is a need exceptionally to allow expenditure incurred by a Member State to be eligible for co-financing if it relates to actions that were launched after 1 January 2003 and before the entry into force of this Regulation, provided that these actions have not been completed when the Commission approves the related national programme.</p><p>(21) Member States should designate the authorities and agencies responsible for the handling and forwarding of data and for the administration of the Community contribution.</p><p>(22) Member States should also draw up reports on various monitoring activities, which should be submitted to the Commission.</p><p>(23) The data should be disseminated taking into account the UN/ECE 1998 Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters (Aarhus Convention) and relevant Community provisions on access to environmental information.</p><p>(24) The measures of general scope necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(14).</p><p>(25) The Standing Forestry Committee should assist the Commission by use of the regulatory procedure in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 2(b) of that Decision.</p><p>(26) It is important to keep the scheme under review and assess its effectiveness, in order to identify needs to be addressed. The Commission should report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the scheme, in particular in view of its continuation beyond the implementation period fixed in this Regulation.</p><p>(27) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the monitoring of forests, their condition and environment interactions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p><p>(28) The Europe Agreements between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, of the other part, provide for participation of these countries in Community programmes, in particular in the field of the environment. The scheme should also be open to participation by other European countries.</p><p>(29) In the light of the expiry of Regulations (EEC) No 3528/86 and (EEC) No 2158/92 and in order to avoid any overlap or discontinuity it is appropriate for this Regulation to apply from 1 January 2003,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p><p></p><p>SECTION 1 Objectives, content and definitions</p><p>Article 1</p><p>1. A Community scheme for broad-based, harmonised and comprehensive, long-term monitoring of the condition of forests, (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the scheme&quot;) is hereby established to:</p><p>(a) continue and further develop:</p><p>- monitoring of air pollution and air pollution effects and of other agents and factors that have an impact on forests, such as biotic and abiotic factors and factors of anthropogenic origin,</p><p>- monitoring of forest fires and their causes and effects,</p><p>- forest fire prevention;</p><p>(b) assess the requirements for and develop the monitoring of soils, carbon sequestration, climate change effects and biodiversity, as well as protective functions of forests;</p><p>(c) continuously evaluate the efficiency of the monitoring activities in the assessment of the condition of forests and the further development of monitoring activity.</p><p>The scheme shall provide reliable and comparable data and information on the condition of and harmful influences on forests at Community level. It shall also help to evaluate ongoing measures to promote conservation and protection of forests for the benefit of sustainable development, with particular emphasis on actions taken to reduce impacts negatively affecting forests. The scheme will take account of, and where appropriate link to, existing and planned national, European and global monitoring mechanisms and will be in line with relevant international agreements.</p><p>2. Where reference is made to forests in this Regulation, Member States may include other wooded land. Where reference is made to forests in the context of forest fires in this Regulation, Member States may in addition include other land.</p><p>3. In France, the scheme shall not be applicable to the overseas departments.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>1. The scheme shall provide for actions designed to:</p><p>(a) promote harmonised collection, handling and assessment of data;</p><p>(b) improve data evaluation and promote integrated data evaluation at Community level;</p><p>(c) improve the quality of data and information gathered under the scheme;</p><p>(d) further develop the monitoring activity of the scheme;</p><p>(e) enhance the understanding of forests and, in particular, the impact of natural and anthropogenic stresses;</p><p>(f) study the dynamics of forest fires and their causes and impacts on forests;</p><p>(g) develop indicators as well as methodologies for risk assessment concerning multiple stresses on forests over time and space.</p><p>2. The actions set out in paragraph 1 shall be complementary to Community research programmes.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:</p><p>(a) &quot;forest&quot; means land with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10 % and area of more than 0,5 ha. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 m at maturity in situ. It may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground, or of open forest formations with a continuous vegetation cover in which tree crown cover exceeds 10 %. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes which have yet to reach a crown density of 10 % or tree height of 5 m are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest. The definition of &quot;forest&quot; includes: forest nurseries and seed orchards that constitute an integral part of the forest; forest roads, cleared tracts, firebreaks and other small open areas within the forest; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of special environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest; windbreaks and shelterbelts of trees with an area of more than 0,5 ha and a width of more than 20 m. Rubberwood plantations and cork oak stands are included. However, the definition of &quot;forest&quot; excludes: land predominantly used for agricultural practices;</p><p>(b) &quot;other wooded land&quot; means land either with a tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 5 to 10 % of trees able to reach a height of 5 m at maturity in situ, or a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10 % of trees not able to reach a height of 5 m at maturity in situ (e.g. dwarf or stunted trees) and shrub or bush cover. The definition of &quot;other wooded land&quot; excludes: areas having the tree, shrub or bush cover specified above but of less than 0,5 ha and width of 20 m, which are classed under &quot;other land&quot;; land predominantly used for agricultural practices;</p><p>(c) &quot;other land&quot; means land not classified as forest or other wooded land as defined in this Regulation, but which nonetheless has been included in forest fire statistics under national law. Such land may include heathland, waste land or agricultural land adjoining or enclosed by forest land;</p><p>(d) &quot;forest fire&quot; means fire which breaks out and spreads on forest and other wooded land or which breaks out on other land and spreads to forest and other wooded land. The definition of &quot;forest fire&quot; excludes: prescribed or controlled burning, usually with the aim of reducing or eliminating the quantity of accumulated fuel on the ground;</p><p>(e) &quot;geo-referenced&quot; means a reference to a specific geographic area within which data or other information is gathered. The area referred to may be larger than the area or point from which the data/information is gathered, for example in order to ensure anonymity as regards the source of gathered data/information.</p><p></p><p>SECTION 2 Monitoring and tools to improve and develop the scheme</p><p>Article 4</p><p>1. Building on the achievements of Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86, the scheme shall:</p><p>(a) continue and further develop the systematic network of observation points in order to conduct periodic inventories in order to gather representative information on the condition of forests;</p><p>(b) continue and further develop the network of observation plots, on which intensive and continuous monitoring of forests is carried out.</p><p>2. Detailed rules for the implementation of paragraph 1 shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2).</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>1. Building on the achievements of Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92, the scheme shall continue and further develop the information system in order to collect comparable information on forest fires at Community level.</p><p>2. The scheme shall allow Member States to conduct studies on the identification of the causes and dynamics of forest fires, as well as on their impacts on forests. Those studies shall complement activities and measures relating to forest fires undertaken in accordance with Decision 1999/847/EC, Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 and Regulation (EEC) No 1615/89.</p><p>In addition and up to 31 December 2005, awareness-raising campaigns and special training for agents involved in fire prevention interventions shall be financed separately in accordance with Article 13(1), unless such measures are included in the rural development programmes.</p><p>3. Forest fire prevention measures which were eligible under Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 shall be financed in accordance with Articles 12(2)b and 13(1), provided that they are not supported by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 and that they are not included in the national/regional rural development programmes.</p><p>4. Member States may, at their request, participate in the measures and activities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.</p><p>5. Detailed rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 17(2).</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>1.
