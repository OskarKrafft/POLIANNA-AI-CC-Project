However, some medicinal products for human use are authorised subject to additional monitoring. This includes all medicinal products for human use with a new active substance and biological medicinal products, including biosimilars, which are priorities for pharmacovigilance. Competent authorities may also require additional monitoring for specific medicinal products for human use that are subject to the obligation to conduct a post-authorisation safety study or to conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product that will be specified in the risk management plan. Risk management plans are normally required for new active substances, biosimilars, medicinal products for paediatric use and for medicinal products for human use involving a significant change in the marketing authorisation, including a new manufacturing process of a biotechnologically-derived medicinal product. Medicinal products for human use subject to additional monitoring should be identified as such by a black symbol, which will be selected by the Commission on the basis of a recommendation by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, and an appropriate standardised explanatory sentence in the summary of product characteristics and in the package leaflet. The Agency should keep an up-to-date, publicly available list of such medicinal products.</p>
