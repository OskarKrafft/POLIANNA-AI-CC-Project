A number of major developments in the European Neighbourhood prompted a comprehensive strategic review of the ENP in 2011. The review provides, inter alia, for greater support to partners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms in line with the incentive-based approach (‘more for more’) and the principle of ‘mutual accountability’, partnership with societies and a more differentiated and tailor-made approach towards the individual partner countries. This Regulation should establish clear links between the ENP framework and the support to be provided under this Regulation.</p>

Those initiatives are all strategically important and offer equally meaningful political frameworks for deepening relations with and among partner countries, based on the principles of mutual accountability, shared ownership and responsibility. This Regulation should also support the implementation of regional cooperation throughout the European Neighbourhood, inter alia in the framework of the Northern Dimension policy or the Black Sea Synergy, as well as, primarily in the case of cross-border cooperation, the external aspects of relevant macro-regional strategies.</p>

The European Commission will not oppose the adoption of the text as agreed by the co-legislators. Nevertheless, the European Commission recalls that the question of delimitation between Articles 290 and 291 TFEU is currently under examination by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the ‘biocides’ case.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The European Parliament considers that any suspension of assistance under these instruments would modify the overall financial scheme agreed under the ordinary legislative procedure.
