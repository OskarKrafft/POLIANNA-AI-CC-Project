            <p class="oj-normal">As regards Directive 2004/18/EC, the Commission should be empowered in particular to make technical adjustments to certain provisions of the Directive and its Annexes, in line with technical progress or developments in Member States, and to revise the thresholds for application of the arrangements. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2004/18/EC, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">On grounds of efficiency and because of the time-limits imposed by the procedures laid down for calculation and publication, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the revision of certain thresholds.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to have recourse to the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of amendments of a purely technical nature.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Accordingly, Directive 2004/18/EC is hereby amended as follows:</p>

Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 93/74/EEC, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span>, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes are playing an increasing role in the diet of pet animals and are also used in the rearing of productive livestock. The composition and preparation of such feedingstuffs must be specially designed to meet the particular nutritional needs of categories of pets or productive livestock whose process of assimilation, absorption or metabolism could briefly be impaired or is temporarily or irreversibly impaired. Users of such feedingstuffs therefore need to be provided immediately with accurate and meaningful information so that they can make appropriate choices. When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to have recourse to the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of general provisions regarding the application of the indications contained in the list of intended uses and for the adoption of amendments, in line with developments in scientific and technical knowledge, to the list of intended uses and the general provisions regarding the application of the indications contained in the list of intended uses.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">As regards Directive 2002/98/EC, the Commission should be empowered in particular to adapt the technical requirements set out in Annexes I to IV to technical and scientific progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2002/98/EC, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span>, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In the event that scientific and technical developments indicate that additional information should be provided to or obtained from donors, in order, for instance, to exclude donors presenting a health risk to others, an adaptation should be made without delay. Similarly, if scientific progress suggests new eligibility criteria concerning the suitability of blood and plasma donors, new deferral criteria should be added to the list immediately. When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to have recourse to the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adaptation to scientific and technical progress of the technical requirements concerning information to be provided to or obtained from donors, as well as requirements related to the suitability of blood and plasma donors, set out in Annexes I to IV.</p>

Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span>, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to have recourse to the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of specific measures regarding the modification, suspension or revocation of Community authorisations.</p>
