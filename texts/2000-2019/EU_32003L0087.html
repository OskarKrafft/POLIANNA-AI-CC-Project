In its Conclusions of 8 March 2001, the Council recognised the particular importance of the European Climate Change Programme and of work based on the Green Paper, and underlined the urgent need for concrete action at Community level.</p>

The use of the mechanisms shall be supplemental to domestic action, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Kyoto Protocol and Marrakesh Accords.</p>

      <p id="d1e41-44-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions</p>
      <p class="normal">Emissions shall be monitored either by calculation or on the basis of measurement.</p>
      <p id="d1e48-44-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Calculation</p>
      <p class="normal">Calculations of emissions shall be performed using the formula:</p>
      <p class="normal">Activity data × Emission factor × Oxidation factor</p>
      <p class="normal">Activity data (fuel used, production rate etc.) shall be monitored on the basis of supply data or measurement.</p>
      <p class="normal">Accepted emission factors shall be used. Activity-specific emission factors are acceptable for all fuels. Default factors are acceptable for all fuels except non-commercial ones (waste fuels such as tyres and industrial process gases). Seam-specific defaults for coal, and EU-specific or producer country-specific defaults for natural gas shall be further elaborated. IPCC default values are acceptable for refinery products. The emission factor for biomass shall be zero.</p>
      <p class="normal">If the emission factor does not take account of the fact that some of the carbon is not oxidised, then an additional oxidation factor shall be used. If activity-specific emission factors have been calculated and already take oxidation into account, then an oxidation factor need not be applied.</p>
      <p class="normal">Default oxidation factors developed pursuant to Directive 96/61/EC shall be used, unless the operator can demonstrate that activity-specific factors are more accurate.</p>
      <p class="normal">A separate calculation shall be made for each activity, installation and for each fuel.</p>
      <p id="d1e67-44-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Measurement</p>
      <p class="normal">Measurement of emissions shall use standardised or accepted methods, and shall be corroborated by a supporting calculation of emissions.</p>
      <p id="d1e74-44-1" class="ti-grseq-1">Monitoring of emissions of other greenhouse gases</p>
      <p class="normal">Standardised or accepted methods shall be used, developed by the Commission in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 23(2).</p>
