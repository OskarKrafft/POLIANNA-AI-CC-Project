Usually, such species do not present a significant health risk for humans or other animals and therefore only a few animal health rules, if any, apply. In order to avoid unnecessary administrative burdens and costs, this Regulation should adhere to the approach adopted in the past, namely to provide the legal framework enabling detailed animal health rules to be laid down for movements of such animals and their products if the risks involved so require.</p>

The keeping of such pet animals for purely private purposes, including ornamental aquatic animals in households, both indoors and outdoors, generally poses a lower health risk compared to other ways of keeping or moving animals on a broader scale, such as those common in agriculture, aquaculture, animal shelters and the transport of animals more generally. Therefore, it is not appropriate that the general requirements concerning registration, record keeping and movements within the Union should apply to such pet animals, as this would represent an unjustified administrative burden and cost. Registration and record keeping requirements should therefore not apply to pet keepers. In addition, specific rules should apply to non–commercial movements of pet animals within the Union.</p>

Action No 5 advocated in the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ‘Action plan against the rising threats from antimicrobial resistance’ emphasises the preventive role to be played by this Regulation and the consequent expected reduction of the use of antibiotics in animals. This resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials to which they were previously responsive complicates the treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals and may thus pose a threat to human or animal health. As a result, microorganisms that have developed resistance to antimicrobials should be treated as if they were transmissible diseases, and thus covered by the scope of this Regulation. This will enable action to be taken against antimicrobial-resistant organisms where appropriate and necessary.</p>

Furthermore, diseases and species that are important today may be marginalised in the future. Therefore the scope of this Regulation should be broad and the rules laid down should be focused on diseases with high public relevance. The OIE has, with the support of the European Commission, produced a study on the ‘Listing and categorisation of priority animal diseases, including those transmissible to humans’ and a tool for such an exercise, which aims to develop a system of disease prioritisation and categorisation. That tool is an example of a systematic approach to the collection and assessment of information about animal diseases.</p>

The role of biosecurity is also recognised in the impact assessment for the adoption of this Regulation, in which possible impacts are specifically assessed. The biosecurity measures adopted should be sufficiently flexible, suit the type of production and the species or categories of animals involved and take account of the local circumstances and technical developments. Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down minimum requirements necessary for the uniform application of biosecurity measures in the Member States. Nevertheless, it should always remain within the power of operators, Member States or the Commission to promote prevention of transmissible diseases through higher biosecurity standards by developing their own guides to good practice. While biosecurity may require some upfront investment, the resulting reduction in animal disease should be a positive incentive for operators.</p>

In order to ensure a flexible approach and to address the specificities of different listed diseases and the availability of effective treatments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the restrictions on, prohibitions of or obligations to use certain veterinary medicinal products within the framework of the control of certain listed diseases. In urgent cases and in order to address emerging risks with possibly devastating implications for animal or public health, the economy, society or the environment, it should be possible for the measures in this regard to be adopted by means of the urgency procedure.</p>

Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to achieve a harmonised approach to the granting of such exemptions. Such a harmonised approach is particularly necessary in order to prevent certain types of establishments from being excluded from the registration obligation. This is particularly relevant not only as regards those establishments which pose a more than insignificant risk to animal health but also as regards establishments which pose a more than insignificant risk to public health. An example of such risk is the keeping of animals that live in close contact with, or proximity to, humans, such as the breeding of dogs at a level involving a certain continuity of activities and a certain degree of organisation with the primary aim of their being sold for the purpose of becoming pet animals in households.</p>

For example, germinal products establishments and assembly operations should meet certain conditions and should be approved in order to comply with international standards, thereby enabling the Union to provide animal health guarantees to third countries when trading. Such conditions should also involve requirements for specific training or professional qualifications for certain very specific establishments or operations (e.g. for embryo collection teams), or even the obligation for specific supervision by the competent authority.

                           <p class="oj-normal">The legal framework currently laid down in Union animal health legislation, for the movement of terrestrial animals and products lays down harmonised rules primarily for such movements between Member States, while leaving it up to the Member States to determine the necessary movement requirements within their territory. A comparison between the current situation and an option whereby rules for movements within Member States would also be harmonised at Union level was set out at length in the impact assessment for the adoption of this Regulation. It has been concluded that the current approach should be maintained, as complete harmonisation of all movements would be very complex and the benefits in terms of the facilitation of movements between Member States do not outweigh the negative impact this could have on the ability to control diseases.</p>

The status of confined establishments, for which operators may apply on a voluntary basis, was first introduced in Directive 92/65/EEC, which lays down rules and requirements for approval and movement requirements for approved bodies, institutes and centres. The system thereby established enables those establishments to exchange animals amongst themselves with fewer movement requirements, at the same time providing health guarantees within the circuit of confined establishments. Consequently, it has been broadly accepted by the operators and used as a voluntary option. It is therefore appropriate in this Regulation to preserve the concept of confined establishments and also to lay down rules for movement between those establishments.</p>

As movements of live wild aquatic animals with an unknown or confirmed disease positive health status and intended for human consumption may also pose a risk of spreading listed or emerging diseases, the same system of rules should also apply to them.

Such adequate and efficient official control measures should also be preserved in the future. As part of the ‘Smarter rules for safer food’ package of proposals, this Regulation does not envisage provisions on official controls since those rules should be provided for in the framework of the proposed horizontal legislation on official controls. However, even if the proposed new horizontal rules on official controls were not to enter into force at the same time as this Regulation, the existing horizontal rules on official controls would allow the Commission to ensure an equivalent level of control.</p>
