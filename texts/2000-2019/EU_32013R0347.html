The European Council of 4 February 2011 recalled the importance of promoting a regulatory framework attractive to investment in networks, with tariffs set at levels consistent with financing needs and the appropriate cost allocation for cross-border investments, while enhancing competition and competitiveness and taking account of the impact on consumers. When deciding on cross-border cost allocation, national regulatory authorities should ensure that its impact on national tariffs does not represent a disproportionate burden for consumers. The national regulatory authorities should also avoid the risks of double support for projects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only insofar as they are designed to cover the costs concerned and as much as possible related to the projects. When an investment request takes into account benefits beyond the borders of the Member States concerned, the national regulatory authorities should consult the TSOs concerned on the project-specific cost-benefit analysis.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The existing internal energy market law requires that tariffs for access to gas and electricity networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. When applying the internal energy market law, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. This applies in particular to innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and to gas transmission infrastructure offering advanced capacity or additional flexibility to the market to allow for short-term trading or back-up supply in case of supply disruptions.</p>

The European Council of 4 February 2011 recognised that some energy infrastructure projects may require limited public finance to leverage private funding. In the light of the economic and financial crisis and budgetary constraints, targeted support, through grants and financial instruments, should be developed under the next multiannual financial framework, which will attract new investors into the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas, while keeping the budgetary contribution of the Union to a minimum. The relevant measures should draw on the experience gained during the pilot phase following the introduction of project bonds to finance infrastructure projects.</p>

This will ensure that tailor-made support can be provided to those projects of common interest which are not viable under the existing regulatory framework and market conditions. It is important to avoid any distortion of competition, in particular between projects contributing to the achievement of the same Union priority corridor. Such financial assistance should ensure the necessary synergies with the Structural Funds, which will finance smart energy distribution networks of local or regional importance. A three-step logic applies to investments in projects of common interest. First, the market should have the priority to invest. Second, if investments are not made by the market, regulatory solutions should be explored, if necessary the relevant regulatory framework should be adjusted, and the correct application of the relevant regulatory framework should be ensured. Third, where the first two steps are not sufficient to deliver the necessary investments in projects of common interest, Union financial assistance could be granted if the project of common interest fulfils the applicable eligibility criteria.</p>
