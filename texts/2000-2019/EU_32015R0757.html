This reduction of transport costs should facilitate international trade. Furthermore, a robust MRV system is a prerequisite for any market-based measure, efficiency standard or other measure, whether applied at Union level or globally. It also provides reliable data to set precise emission reduction targets and to assess the progress of maritime transport's contribution towards achieving a low carbon economy. Given the international nature of shipping, the preferred and most effective method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in international maritime transport would be by global agreement.</p>

A threshold of 5 000 gross tonnage (GT) has been selected after detailed objective analysis of sizes and emissions of ships going to and coming from Union ports. Ships above 5 000 GT account for around 55 % of the number of ships calling into Union ports and represent around 90 % of the related emissions. This non-discriminatory threshold would ensure that that the most relevant emitters are covered. A lower threshold would result in a higher administrative burden while a higher threshold would limit the coverage of emissions and thus the environmental effectiveness of the MRV system.</p>
