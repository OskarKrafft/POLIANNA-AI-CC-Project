Efforts to limit international maritime emissions through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) are under way and should be encouraged. The IMO has set up a process to adopt in 2018 an initial emission reduction strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping. The adoption of an ambitious emission reduction objective as part of this initial strategy has become a matter of urgency and is important for ensuring that international shipping contributes its fair share to the efforts needed to achieve the objective of well below 2 °C agreed under the Paris Agreement. The Commission should keep this under regular review, and should report at least once a year to the European Parliament and to the Council on the progress achieved in the IMO towards an ambitious emission reduction objective, and on accompanying measures to ensure that the sector duly contributes to the efforts needed to achieve the objectives agreed under the Paris Agreement. Action from the IMO or the Union should start from 2023, including preparatory work on adoption and implementation and due consideration being given by all stakeholders.</p>

The Commission's Impact Assessment specifies that the share of allowances to be auctioned is 57 % over the period from 2013 to 2020. In principle, that share should remain 57 %. It is made up of allowances auctioned on behalf of Member States, including allowances set aside for new entrants but not allocated, allowances for modernising electricity generation in some Member States and allowances which are to be auctioned at a later point in time because of their placement in the market stability reserve established by Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_2018076EN.01000301-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_2018076EN.01000301-E0007"

In the event that demand for free allowances triggers the need to apply a uniform cross-sectoral correction factor before 2030, the share of allowances to be auctioned over the ten year period beginning on 1 January 2021 should be reduced by up to 3 % of the total quantity of allowances. For the purposes of solidarity, growth and interconnections, 10 % of the allowances to be auctioned by the Member States should be distributed among those Member States whose gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at market prices did not exceed 90 % of the Union average in 2013, and the rest of the allowances should be distributed among all Member States on the basis of verified emissions. The derogation for certain Member States with an average level of income per capita more than 20 % higher than the Union average in relation to that distribution in the period from 2013 to 2020 should expire.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To preserve the environmental benefit of emission reductions in the Union while actions by third countries do not provide comparable incentives to industry to reduce emissions, transitional free allocation should continue to installations in sectors and subsectors at genuine risk of carbon leakage. Experience gathered during the operation of the EU ETS has confirmed that sectors and subsectors are at risk of carbon leakage to varying degrees, and that free allocation has prevented carbon leakage. While some sectors and subsectors can be deemed to be at a higher risk of carbon leakage, others are able to pass on a considerable share of the costs of allowances to cover their emissions in product prices without losing market share, and only bear the remaining part of the costs so that they are at a low risk of carbon leakage. The Commission should determine and differentiate the relevant sectors based on their trade intensity and their emissions intensity to better identify sectors at genuine risk of carbon leakage.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">While the assessment of sectors and subsectors should take place at a 4-digit level (NACE-4 code), specific circumstances should also be anticipated in which it may be appropriate to have the possibility of requesting an assessment at a 6-digit or an 8-digit level (Prodcom). Such possibility should exist where sectors and subsectors have previously been considered to be exposed to carbon leakage at a 6-digit or an 8-digit level (Prodcom), given that certain NACE codes, in particular those ending with .99, encompass heterogeneous activities ‘not elsewhere classified’ (‘n.e.c.’). Where a sector or subsector is subject to the refineries benchmark and another product benchmark, this circumstance should be taken into account so that, where relevant, a qualitative analysis of the risk of carbon leakage can be done to ensure a level playing field for products produced both in refineries and in chemical plants. Where, based on the criteria of trade intensity and emissions intensity, a threshold determined by taking into account the respective possibility for sectors and subsectors concerned to pass on costs in product prices is exceeded, the sector or subsector should be deemed at risk of carbon leakage. Other sectors and subsectors should be considered to be at low risk or no risk of carbon leakage. Taking into account the possibilities for sectors and subsectors outside of electricity generation to pass on costs through product prices should also reduce windfall profits. Unless otherwise decided in a review pursuant to Article 30 of Directive 2003/87/EC, free allocations to sectors and subsectors considered to be at low risk or no risk of carbon leakage, except district heating, should decrease by equal amounts after 2026 so as to reach a level of no free allocation in 2030.</p>

In order to reflect technological progress in the sectors concerned and adjust the benchmark values to the relevant period of allocation, provision should be made for the benchmark values for free allocations to installations, determined on the basis of data from the years 2007 and 2008, to be updated in line with observed improvement. For reasons of predictability, this should be done through applying a factor that represents the best assessment of progress across sectors, which should then take into account robust, objective and verified data from installations, considering the average performance of the 10 % most efficient installations, so that benchmark values reflect the actual rate of improvement. Where the data shows an annual reduction of less than 0,2 % or more than 1,6 % of the 2007-2008 value over the relevant period, the related benchmark value should be adjusted with rates other than the actual rates of improvement to preserve emission reduction incentives and properly reward innovation. For the period from 2021 to 2025, those benchmark values should be adjusted in respect of each year between 2008 and the middle of the period from 2021 to 2025 with either 0,2 % or 1,6 %, leading to an improvement of 3 % or 24 % respectively compared to the value applicable in the period from 2013 to 2020. For the period from 2026 to 2030, those benchmark values should be adjusted in the same way, leading to an improvement of 4 % or 32 % respectively compared to the value applicable in the period from 2013 to 2020. To ensure a level playing field for the production of aromatics, hydrogen and syngas in refineries and chemical plants, the benchmark values for aromatics, hydrogen and syngas should continue to be aligned to the refineries benchmarks.</p>

To enhance the transparency in relation to the extent to which such compensation is provided, Member States should regularly report to the public on the measures they have in place and on the beneficiaries of the compensation, while ensuring that the confidential nature of certain information and related data protection concerns are duly taken into account. Where a Member State uses a significant amount of its auction revenues for compensating indirect costs, there is an increased interest in making public the reasons for this choice. When reviewing its State aid guidelines on compensation for indirect emission costs, the Commission should consider <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span> the usefulness of upper limits on the compensation granted by Member States. The review of Directive 2003/87/EC should consider the extent to which those financial measures have been effective in avoiding significant risks of carbon leakage due to indirect costs, and consider the possibility of further harmonisation of the measures, including a harmonised mechanism. Public sector climate finance will continue to play an important role in mobilising resources after 2020.</p>

The amount of climate finance to be mobilised will also depend on the ambition and quality of the Nationally Determined Contributions, subsequent investment plans and national adaptation planning processes. Regarding the potential social impacts of policies and investments required, Member States should also use auction revenues to contribute to a just transition to a low-carbon economy by promoting skill formation and reallocation of labour in social dialogue with the communities and regions affected by the transition of jobs.</p>

Furthermore, as a long-term measure to improve the functioning of the EU ETS, unless otherwise decided in the first review in accordance with Article 3 of Decision (EU) 2015/1814, from 2023 allowances held in the reserve above the total number of allowances auctioned during the previous year should no longer be valid.
