Such a person must likewise inform the competent authorities of the home Member State if he/she proposes to increase his/her qualifying holding so that the proportion of the voting rights or of the capital held by him/her would reach or exceed 20 %, 33 % or 50 % or so that the assurance undertaking would become his/her subsidiary.</p>
   <p class="normal">The competent authorities of the home Member State shall have a maximum of three months from the date of the notification provided for in the first subparagraph to oppose such a plan if, in view of the need to ensure sound and prudent management of the assurance undertaking, they are not satisfied as to the qualifications of the person referred to in the first subparagraph. If they do not oppose the plan in question they may fix a maximum period for its implementation.</p>
   <p class="normal">2.   Member States shall require any natural or legal person who proposes to dispose, directly or indirectly, of a qualifying holding in an assurance undertaking first to inform the competent authorities of the home Member State, indicating the size of his/her intended holding. Such a person must likewise inform the competent authorities if he/she proposes to reduce his/her qualifying holding so that the proportion of the voting rights or of the capital held by him/her would fall below 20 %, 33 % or 50 % or so that the assurance undertaking would cease to be his/her subsidiary.</p>
   <p class="normal">3.   On becoming aware of them, assurance undertakings shall inform the competent authorities of their home Member States of any acquisitions or disposals of holdings in their capital that cause holdings to exceed or fall below one of the thresholds referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.</p>
   <p class="normal">They shall also, at least once a year, inform them of the names of shareholders and members possessing qualifying holdings and the sizes of such holdings as shown, for example, by the information received at the annual general meetings of shareholders and members or as a result of compliance with the regulations relating to companies listed on stock exchanges.</p>
   <p class="normal">4.   Member States shall require that, if the influence exercised by the persons referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to operate to the detriment of the prudent and sound management of the assurance undertaking, the competent authorities of the home Member State shall take appropriate measures to put an end to that situation. Such measures may consist, for example, in injunctions, sanctions against directors and managers, or the suspension of the exercise of the voting rights attaching to the shares held by the shareholders or members in question.</p>
   <p class="normal">Similar measures shall apply to natural or legal persons failing to comply with the obligation to provide prior information, as laid down in paragraph 1. If a holding is acquired despite the opposition of the competent authorities, the Member States shall, regardless of any other sanctions to be adopted, provide either for exercise of the corresponding voting rights to be suspended, or for the nullity of votes cast or for the possibility of their annulment.</p>
