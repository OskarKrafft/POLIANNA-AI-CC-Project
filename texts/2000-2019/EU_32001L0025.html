<p>Directive 2001/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 4 April 2001</p><p>on the minimum level of training of seafarers</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p><p>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1),</p><p>Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) Council Directive 94/58/EC of 22 November 1994 on the minimum level of training of seafarers(3) has been substancially amended(4). In the interests of clarity and rationality, it should therefore be consolidated.</p><p>(2) Actions to be taken at Community level in the field of maritime safety and pollution prevention at sea should be in line with internationally agreed rules and standards.</p><p>(3) In its conclusions of 25 January 1993 on maritime safety and pollution prevention in the Community, the Council noted the importance of the human element in the safe operation of ships.</p><p>(4) In its resolution of 8 June 1993 on a common policy on safe seas(5), the Council set the objective of removing substandard crews and gave priority to Community action aiming at enhancing training and education by developing common standards for minimum training levels of key personnel, including the question of a common language on board Community vessels.</p><p>(5) In its resolution of 24 March 1997(6) on a new strategy to increase the competitiveness of Community shipping the Council sought to promote the employment of Community seafarers and shore-based personnel. To that end the Council agreed that action should be undertaken to help Community shipping to continue striving for high quality and improve its competitiveness by ensuring the continued high-quality training of Community seafarers of all ranks and of shore-based personnel.</p><p>(6) The standards of training for the award of vocational competency certificates to seafarers vary from one Member State to another. Such a diversity of national laws in the area of training covered by this Directive does not ensure the consistent level of training required in the interests of maritime safety.</p><p>(7) Council Directives 89/48/EEC(7) and 92/51/EEC(8) on the general system for the recognition of professional education and training apply to maritime occupations covered by this Directive. They will help promote compliance with the obligations laid down in the Treaty abolishing obstacles to the free movement of persons and services between Member States.</p><p>(8) The mutual recognition of diplomas and certificates provided for under the general system Directives does not always ensure a standardised level of training for all seafarers serving on board vessels flying the flag of a Member State. This is, however, vital from the viewpoint of maritime safety.</p><p>(9) It is therefore essential to define a minimum level of training for seafarers in the Community. It is appropriate that the action in this field should be based on the standards of training already agreed at international level, namely the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW Convention), as revised in 1995; all Member States are Parties to that Convention.</p><p>(10) Member States may establish standards higher than the minimum standards laid down in the STCW Convention and this Directive.</p><p>(11) The Regulations of the STCW Convention set out in Annex I to this Directive should be supplemented by the mandatory provisions contained in Part A of the STCW Code. Part B of the STCW Code contains recommended guidance intended to assist Parties to the STCW Convention and those involved in implementing, applying or enforcing its measures to give the Convention full and complete effect in uniform manner.</p><p>(12) For the enhancement of maritime safety and pollution prevention at sea provisions on minimum rest periods for watchkeeping personnel should be established in this Directive in accordance with the STCW Convention. Those provisions should be applied without prejudice to the provisions of Council Directive 1999/63/EC of 21 June 1999 concerning the Agreement on the organisation of working time of seafarers concluded by the European Community Shipowners&#039; Association (ECSA) and the Federation of Transport Workers&#039;s Unions in the European Union (FST)(9).</p><p>(13) In order to enhance maritime safety and prevent loss of human life and maritime pollution, communication among crew members on board ships sailing in Community waters should be improved.</p><p>(14) Personnel on board passenger ships nominated to assist passengers in emergency situations should be able to communicate with the passengers.</p><p>(15) Crews serving on board tankers carrying noxious or polluting cargo should be capable of coping efficiently with accident prevention and emergency situations. It is paramount that a proper communication link between the master, officers and ratings is esablished, covering the requirements provided for in Article 17.</p><p>(16) Measures should be taken to ensure that seafarers holding certificates issued by third countries have a level of competence commensurate with that required by the STCW Convention.</p><p>(17) In order to attain this objective, common criteria should be defined for the recognition of foreign certificates in the Community. The establishment of common criteria for the Member States&#039; recognition of certificates issued by third countries should be based on the training and certification requirements as agreed in the framework of the STCW Convention.</p><p>(18) In the interests of safety at sea, Member States should recognise qualifications proving the required level of training only where these are issued by or on behalf of Parties to the STCW Convention which have been identified by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) as having been shown to have given, and still to be giving, full effect to the standards set out in that Convention. To bridge the time gap until the MSC has been albe to carry out such identification, a procedure for the preliminary recognition of certificates is needed.</p><p>(19) Where appropriate, maritime institutes, training programmes and courses should be inspected. Criteria for such inspection should therefore be established.</p><p>(20) A committee should be established to assist the Commission in carrying out the tasks related to the exercise of the recognition of certificates issued by training institutes or administrations of third countries.</p><p>(21) Member States, as port authorities, are required to enhance safety and prevention of pollution in Community waters through priority inspection of vessels flying the flag of a third country which has not ratified the STCW Convention, thereby ensuring no more favourable treatment to vessels flying the flag of a third State.</p><p>(22) It is appropriate to include in this Directive provisions on port State control, pending the amendment of Council Directive 95/21/EC of 19 June 1995 concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control)(10) in order to transfer to that Directive the provisions on port State control which are included in Articles 17(f), 19, 20 and 21 of this Directive.</p><p>(23) It is necessary to provide for procedures for adapting this Directive to changes in international conventions and codes.</p><p>(24) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(11).</p><p>(25) The Council should review Annex II in the light of the experience gained in applying this Directive, acting on a proposal to be submitted by the Commission within five years of 25 May 2003.</p><p>(26) Until 1 February 2002 Member States should be allowed to accept on their ships seafarers holding certificates issued in accordance with the provisions which applied before 1 February 1997, the date of entry into force of the revised STCW Convention, provided that those seafarers began their service or training before 1 August 1998.</p><p>(27) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Members States concerning the time-limits for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p><p></p><p>Article 1</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Directive:</p><p>1. &quot;master&quot; shall mean the person having command of a ship;</p><p>2. &quot;officer&quot; shall mean a member of the crew, other than the master, designated as such by national law or regulations or, in the absence of such designation, by collective agreement or custom;</p><p>3. &quot;deck officer&quot; shall mean an officer qualified in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Annex I;</p><p>4. &quot;chief mate&quot; shall mean the officer next in rank to the master upon whom the command of the ship will fall in the event of the incapacity of the master;</p><p>5. &quot;engineer officer&quot; shall mean an officer qualified in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III of Annex I;</p><p>6. &quot;chief engineer officer&quot; shall mean the senior engineer officer responsible for the mechanical propulsion and the operation and maintenance of the mechanical and electrical installations of the ship;</p><p>7. &quot;second engineer officer&quot; shall mean the engineer officer next in rank to the chief engineer officer upon whom the responsibility for the mechanical propulsion and the operation and maintenance of the mechanical and electrical installations of the ship will fall in the event of the incapacity of the chief engineer officer;</p><p>8. &quot;assistant engineer officer&quot; shall mean a person under training to become an engineer officer and designated as such by national law or regulations;</p><p>9. &quot;radio operator&quot; shall mean a person holding an appropriate certificate issued or recognised by the competent authorities under the provisions of the Radio Regulations, as defined in point 18;</p><p>10. &quot;rating&quot; shall mean a member of the ship&#039;s crew other than the master or an officer;</p><p>11. &quot;seagoing ship&quot; shall mean a ship other than those which navigate exclusively in inland waters or in waters within, or closely adjacent to, sheltered waters or areas where port regulations apply;</p><p>12. &quot;ship flying the flag of a Member State&quot; shall mean a ship registered in and flying the flag of a Member State in accordance with its legislation.

When defining near-coastal voyages Member States shall not impose training, experience or certification requirements on seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly the flag of another Member State or another Party to the STCW Convention and engaged on such voyages in a manner resulting in more stringent requirements for such seafarers than for seafarers serving on board ships entitled fo fly its own flag. In no case shall a Member State impose requirements in respect of seafarers serving on board ships flying the flag of another Member State or of another Party to the STCW Convention in excess of those of this Directive in respect of ships not engaged on near-coastal voyages.</p><p>2. With respect to ships entitled to fly the flag of a Member State regularly engaged on near-coastal voyages off the coast of another Member State or of another Party to the STCW Convention, the Member State the flag of which a ship is entitled fo fly shall prescribe training, experience and certification requirements for seafarers serving on such ships at least equal to those of the Member State or the Party to the STCW Convention off the coast of which the ship is engaged, provided that they do not exceed the requirements of this Directive in respect of ships not engaged on near-coastal voyages. Seafarers serving on a ship which extends its voyage beyond what is defined as a near-coastal voyage by a Member State and enters waters not covered by that definition shall fulfil the appropriate requirements of this Directive.</p><p>3. A Member State may afford a ship which is entitled to fly its flag the benefits of the near-coastal voyage provisions of this Directive when it is regularly engaged off the coast of a non-Party to the STCW Convention on near-coastal voyages as defined by that Member State.</p><p>4. Upon deciding on the definition of near-coastal voyages and the conditions of education and training required thereof in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, Member States shall communicate to the Commission the details of the provisions they have adopted.</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>Penalties or disciplinary measures</p><p>1. Member States shall establish processes and procedures for the impartial investigation of any reported incompetence, act or omission, that may pose a direct threat to safety of life or property at sea or to the marine environment, on the part of the holders of certificates or endorsements issued by that Member State in connection with their performance of duties relating to their certificates and for the withdrawal, suspension and cancellation of such certificates for such cause and for the prevention of fraud.</p><p>2. Each Member State shall prescribe penalties or disciplinary measures for cases in which the provisions of this national legislation giving effect to this Directive are not complied with in respect of ships entitled to fly its flag or of seafarers duly certificated by it.</p><p>3. In particular, such penalties or disciplinary measures shall be prescribed and enforced in cases in which:</p><p>(a) a company or a master has engaged a person not holding a certificate as required by this Directive;</p><p>(b) a master has allowed any function or service in any capacity which under this Directive must be performed by a person holding an appropriate certificate to be performed by a person not holding the required certificate, a valid dispensation or having the documentary proof required by Article 18(4); or</p><p>(c) a person has obtained by fraud or forged documents an engagement to perform any function or serve in any capacity which under this Directive must be performed or filled by a person holding a certificate or dispensation.</p><p>4. Member States within the jurisdiction of which any company which or any person who is believed on clear grounds to have been responsible for or to have knowledge of any apparent non-compliance with this Directive specified in paragraph 3 is located shall extend cooperation to any Member State or other Party to the STCW Convention which advises them of its intention to initiate proceedings under its jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>Quality standards</p><p>1. Each Member State shall ensure that:</p><p>(a) all training, assessment of competence, certification, endorsement and revalidation activities carried out by non-governmental agencies or entities under its authority are continuously monitored through a quality standards system to ensure the achievement of defined objectives, including those concerning the qualifications and experience of instructors and accessors;</p><p>(b) where governmental agencies or entities perform such activities, there is a quality-standards system;</p><p>(c) the education and training objectives and related standards of competence to be achieved are clearly defined and identify the levels of knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to the examinations and assessments required under the STCW Convention. The objectives and related quality standards may be specified separately for different courses and training programmes and shall cover the administration of the certification system;</p><p>(d) the fields of application of the quality standards cover the administration of the certification systems, all training courses and programmes, examinations and assessments carried out by or under the authority of each Member State and the qualifications and experience required of instructors and assessors, having regard to the policies, systems, controls and internal quality-assurance reviews established to ensure achievement of the defined objectives.</p><p>2. Member States shall also ensure that independent evaluations of the knowledge, understanding, skills and competence acquisition and assessment activities, and of the administration of the certification system, are conducted at intervals of not more than five years by qualified persons who are not themselves involved in the activities concerned in order to verify that:</p><p>(a) all internal management control and monitoring measures and follow-up actions comply with planned arrangements and documental procedures and are effective in ensuring achievement of the defined objectives;</p><p>(b) the results of each independent evaluation are documented and brought to the attention of those responsible for the area evaluated;</p><p>(c) timely action is taken to correct deficiencies.</p><p>3. A report relating to each evaluation carried out pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be communicated by the Member State concerned to the Commission within six months of the date of the evaluation.</p><p></p><p>Article 10</p><p>Medical standards - Issue and registration of certificates</p><p>1. Member States shall establish standards of medical fitness for seafarers, particularly regarding eyesight and hearing.</p><p>2. Member States shall ensure that certificates are issued only to candidates who comply with the requirements of this Article.</p><p>3. Each candidate for certification shall provide satisfactory proof:</p><p>(a) of his identity;</p><p>(b) that his age is not less than that prescribed in the Regulations in Annex I relevant to the certificate applied for;</p><p>(c) that he meets the standards of medical fitness, particularly regarding eyesight and hearing, established by the Member State and holds a valid document attesting to his medical fitness, issued by a duly qualified medicial practitioner recognised by the competent authority of the Member State;</p><p>(d) of having completed the seagoing service and any related compulsory training prescribed in the Regulations in Annex I for the certificate applied for;</p><p>(e) that he meets the standards of competence prescribed in the Regulations in Annex I for the capacities, functions and levels that are to be identified in the endorsement to the certificate.</p><p>4. Each Member State shall undertake:</p><p>(a) to maintain a register or registers of all certificates and endorsements for masters and officers and, as appropriate, ratings, which are issued, have expired or have been revalidated, suspended, cancelled or reported lost or destroyed and of dispensations issued;</p><p>(b) to make available information on the status of such certificates, endorsements and dispensations to other Member States or other Parties to the STCW Convention and companies which request verification of the authenticity and validity of certificates produced to them by seafarers seeking recognition of their certificates or employment on board ship.</p><p></p><p>Article 11</p><p>Revalidation of certificates</p><p>1. Every master, officer and radio operator holding a certificate issued or recognised under any chapter of Annex I other than Chapter VI who is serving at sea or intends to return to sea after a period ashore shall, in order to continue to qualify for seagoing service, be required at intervals not exceeding five years;</p><p>(a) to meet the standards of medical fitness prescribed by Article 10; and</p><p>(b) to establish continued professional competence in accordance with section A-I/11 of the STCW Code.</p><p>2. Every master, officer and radio operator shall, for continuing seagoing service on board ships for which special training requirements have been internationally agreed upon, successfully complete approved relevant training.</p><p>3. Each Member State shall compare the standards of competence which is required of candidates for certificates issued before 1 February 2002 with those specified for the appropriate certificate in Part A of the STCW Code, and shall determine the need to require the holders of such certificates to undergo appropriate refresher and updating training or assessment.</p><p>Refresher and updating courses shall be approved and include changes in relevant national and international regulations concerning the safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment and take account of any updating of the standard of competency concerned.</p><p>4. Each Member State shall, in consultation with those concerned, formulate or promote the formulation of a structure of refresher and updating courses as provided for in section A-I/11 of the STCW Code.</p><p>5. For the purpose of updating the knowledge of masters, officers and radio operators, each Member State shall ensure that the texts of recent changes in national and international regulations concerning the safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment are made available to ships entitled to fly its flag.</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Use of simulators</p><p>1. The performance standards and other provisions set out in section A-I/12 of the STCW code and such other requirements as are prescribed in Part A of the STCW Code for any certificate concerned shall be complied with in respect of:</p><p>(a) all mandatory simulator-based training;</p><p>(b) any assessment of competence required by Part A of the STCW Code which is carried out by means of a simulator</p><p>(c) any demonstration, by means of a simulator, of continued proficiency required by Part A of the STCW Code.</p><p>2. Simulators installed or brought into use before 1 February 2002 may be exempted from full compliance with the performance standards referred to in paragraph 1 at the discretion of each member State.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>Responsibilities of companies</p><p>1.
