A new cab profile could also incorporate energy absorption structures in the event of a collision. Furthermore, the potential gain in the volume of the cab should improve the driver's safety and comfort. Once improved safety requirements for longer cabs have been developed, consideration can be given to whether it is appropriate to apply them to vehicles which do not benefit from the length extension.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Since the adoption of Directive 96/53/EC, the average weight of bus passengers and their luggage has increased substantially. Given the weight limits imposed by that Directive, this has resulted in a gradual reduction in the number of passengers carried. Moreover, the equipment needed to meet the current technical requirements, such as Euro VI, adds to the weight of the vehicles carrying them. The need to promote public transport over private transport in the interests of better energy efficiency means that the previous number of bus passengers must be re-established, taking into account the increase in their weight and that of their luggage. That can be done by increasing the authorised weight for buses with two axles, within limits that none the less ensure that road infrastructure is not damaged as a result of faster erosion.</p>
