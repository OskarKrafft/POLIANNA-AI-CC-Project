It established the Gas Coordination Group which has been useful to exchange information and define common actions between Member States, the Commission, the gas industry and consumers. The Network of Energy Security Correspondents endorsed by the European Council in December 2006 has improved the capacity to collect information and has provided early warning of potential threats to the security of energy supply. The new internal energy market legislation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in July 2009 constitutes an important step to complete the internal energy market and has an explicit objective to enhance the Union’s security of energy supply.</p>

Where the security of supply of a Member State is threatened, there is a clear risk that measures developed unilaterally by that Member State may jeopardise the proper functioning of the internal gas market and the supply of gas to customers. Recent experience has demonstrated the reality of that risk. In order to allow the internal gas market to function even in the face of a shortage of supply, it is necessary to provide for solidarity and coordination in the response to supply crises, both concerning preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply.</p>

In this context particular attention should be given to priority infrastructure actions as identified in the Commission communication of 13 November 2008 entitled ‘Second Strategic Energy Review — An EU energy security and solidarity action plan’, e.g. the southern gas corridor (Nabucco and Interconnector Turkey Greece Italy), a diversified and adequate LNG supply for Europe, effective interconnection of the Baltic region, the Mediterranean Energy Ring and adequate north-south gas interconnections within central and south-east Europe.</p>

Common minimum criteria on security of gas supply should ensure a level playing field for security of gas supply while taking into account national or regional specificities and should create significant incentives to build the necessary infrastructure and to improve the level of preparedness in case of crisis. Demand-side measures such as fuel switching may have a valuable role to play in ensuring energy security where they can be applied quickly and reduce demand appreciably to react to a supply disruption. The efficient use of energy should be further promoted, in particular where demand-side measures are needed. The environmental impact of the proposed demand and supply-side measures should be taken into due account and preference should be given as far as possible to measures with the least impact on the environment while taking into account security of supply aspects.</p>

Such security of supply standards should be stable, so as to provide the necessary legal certainty, should be clearly defined, and should not impose unreasonable and disproportionate burdens on natural gas undertakings, including new entrants and small undertakings, or on end users. Those standards should also guarantee equality of access for natural gas undertakings of the Union to national customers. Measures necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the supply standard may include additional storage capacities and volumes, linepack, supply contracts, interruptible contracts or any other measures that have a similar effect, as well as the necessary technical measures to ensure the safety of gas supply.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">In accordance with Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and as underlined in Article 6 of Directive 2009/73/EC and Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 715/2009, regional cooperation reflects the spirit of solidarity and is also an underlying concept of this Regulation. Regional cooperation is required in particular for the establishment of the risk assessment (Article 9), the Preventive Action Plans and the Emergency Plans (Articles 4, 5 and 10), the infrastructure and supply standards (Articles 6 and 8) and the provisions for Union and regional emergency responses (Article 11).</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The regional cooperation under this Regulation builds on existing regional cooperation involving natural gas undertakings, Member States and national regulatory authorities to enhance, among other objectives, the security of supply and the integration of the internal energy market, such as the three regional gas markets under the Gas Regional Initiative, the Gas Platform, the High Level Group of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan, and the Security of Supply Coordination Group of the Energy Community. However, the specific security of supply requirements are likely to foster new cooperation frameworks, and existing areas of cooperation will have to be adapted in order to guarantee the best efficiency.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">In the light of the increasingly interconnected and interdependent markets and the completion of the internal gas market, cooperation between the following Member States, as an example and among others, including between parts of neighbouring Member States, can enhance their individual and collective security of gas supply:</p>
