The CFP seeks to achieve an exploitation of living marine biological resources that restores fish stocks to and maintains them above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, by 2015, where possible, and at the latest by 2020. The CFP should implement the precautionary and eco-system approaches to fisheries management. Consequently, the EMFF should contribute to the protection of the marine environment as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc12-L_2014149EN.01000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_2014149EN.01000101-E0012"

The programming exercise should cover the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. When preparing the single operational programme, Member States should ensure that the content and volume of their operational programmes reflect the aim of simplification. Each programme should identify a strategy for meeting targets in relation to the Union priorities under the EMFF and a selection of measures. Programming should comply with those Union priorities, while adapting to national contexts, and should complement other Union policies, in particular the rural development policy and the cohesion policy.</p>
