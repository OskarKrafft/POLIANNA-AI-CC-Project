      <p class="normal">1.   Transmission system operators shall receive compensation for costs incurred as a result of hosting cross-border flows of electricity on their networks.</p>
      <p class="normal">2.   The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be paid by the operators of national transmission systems from which cross-border flows originate and the systems where those flows end.</p>

      <p class="normal">The first period of time for which compensation payments shall be made shall be determined in the guidelines referred to in Article 8.</p>
      <p class="normal">4.   Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13(2), the Commission shall decide on the amounts of compensation payments payable.</p>

      <p class="normal">2.   Transaction curtailment procedures shall only be used in emergency situations where the transmission system operator must act in an expeditious manner and redispatching or countertrading is not possible. Any such procedure shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
