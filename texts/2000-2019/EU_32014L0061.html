Scaling up those measures across the Union could significantly contribute to the establishment of a digital single market. Moreover differences in regulatory requirements sometimes prevent cooperation across utilities and may raise barriers to entry for new network operators and new business opportunities, hindering the development of an internal market for use and deployment of physical infrastructures for high-speed electronic communications networks. Finally, the initiatives at Member State level do not always seem to be holistic, whereas it is essential to take action across the whole roll-out process, and across sectors, in order to achieve a coherent and significant impact.</p>

Therefore, a physical infrastructure that is intended to only host other elements of a network without becoming itself an active network element, such as in the case of dark fibre, can in principle be used to accommodate electronic communications cables, equipment or any other element of electronic communications networks, regardless of its actual use or its ownership, in the absence of any security concerns or prejudice to the future business interests of the owner of the infrastructure. The physical infrastructure of public communications networks can in principle also be used to accommodate elements of other networks, and therefore Member States may choose to apply the principle of reciprocity in appropriate cases, and allow public communications network operators to offer access to their networks for the deployment of other networks. Without prejudice to the pursuit of the specific general interest linked to the provision of the main service, synergies across network operators should be encouraged in order to contribute to achieving the targets of the Digital Agenda at the same time.</p>

Such general rules should therefore be abolished.

Similarly, in specific circumstances, sharing the infrastructure may jeopardise safety or public health, network integrity and security, including that of critical infrastructure, or may endanger the provision of services that are primarily provided over the same infrastructure. Moreover, when the network operator already provides wholesale physical network infrastructure access that would meet the needs of the access seeker, access to the underlying physical infrastructure may have an adverse economic impact on its business model and incentives to invest while possibly entailing an inefficient duplication of network elements. At the same time in the case of physical infrastructure access obligations imposed pursuant to the Union regulatory framework for electronic communications, such as those on undertakings having significant market power, this would be already covered by specific regulatory obligations that should not be affected by this Directive.</p>

When determining prices for granting access, the dispute settlement body should ensure that the access provider has a fair opportunity to recover its costs incurred in providing access to its physical infrastructure, taking into account specific national conditions and any tariff structures put in place to provide a fair opportunity for cost recovery taking into account any previous imposition of remedies by a national regulatory authority. In so doing, the dispute settlement body should also take into account the impact of the requested access on the business plan of the access provider, including the investments made by the access provider to whom the access is requested, in particular investments made in the physical infrastructure to which the access is requested. In the specific case of access to physical infrastructures of public communications network providers, the investments made in such infrastructure may directly contribute to the objectives of the Digital Agenda and downstream competition may be influenced by free-riding. Hence, any access obligation should fully take into account the economic viability of those investments based on their risk profile, any time schedule for the return on investment, any impact of access on downstream competition and consequently on prices and return on investment, any depreciation of the network assets at the time of the access request, any business case underpinning the investment, in particular in the physical infrastructures used for the provision of high-speed electronic communications services, and any possibility previously offered to the access seeker to co-deploy.</p>

The existence of high-speed electronic communications networks up to the end-user should be facilitated while ensuring at the same time technological neutrality, in particular by high-speed-ready in-building physical infrastructure. Given that providing for mini-ducts during the construction of a building has only a limited incremental cost while retrofitting buildings with high-speed infrastructure may represent a significant part of the cost of high-speed network deployment, all new buildings or buildings subject to major renovation should be equipped with physical infrastructure, allowing the connection of end-users with high-speed networks. In order to roll out high-speed electronic communications networks, new multi-dwelling buildings and multi-dwelling buildings subject to major renovation should be equipped with an access point, by which the provider may access the in-building infrastructure. Moreover, building developers should foresee that empty ducts are provided from every dwelling to the access point, located in or outside the multi-dwelling building. There may be cases such as new single dwellings or categories of major renovation works in isolated areas where the prospect of high-speed connection is considered, on objective grounds, too remote to justify equipping a building with high-speed-ready in-building physical infrastructure or an access point or where so equipping the building would be disproportionate for other economic, urban heritage conservation or environmental reasons, such as for specific categories of monuments.</p>

Once the network is terminated at the access point, the connection of an additional customer is possible at a significantly lower cost, in particular by means of access to a high-speed-ready vertical segment inside the building, where it already exists. That objective is equally fulfilled when the building itself is already equipped with a high-speed electronic communications network to which access is provided to any public communications network provider who has an active subscriber in the building on transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory terms and conditions. That may in particular be the case in Member States which have taken measures on the basis of Article 12 of Directive 2002/21/EC.</p>
