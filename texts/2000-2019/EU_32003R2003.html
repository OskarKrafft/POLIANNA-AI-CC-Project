<p>Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council</p><p>of 13 October 2003</p><p>relating to fertilisers</p><p></p><p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p><p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p><p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p><p>Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p><p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p><p>Whereas:</p><p>(1) Council Directive 76/116/EEC of 18 December 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fertilisers(4), Council Directive 80/876/EEC of 15 July 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to straight ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content(5), Commission Directive 87/94/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to procedures for the control of characteristics of, limits for and resistance to detonation of straight ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content(6), and Commission Directive 77/535/EEC of 22 June 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to methods of sampling and analysis for fertilisers(7), have been substantially amended several times. In accordance with the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council &quot;Simpler legislation for the internal market&quot; (SLIM) and the Action Plan for the Single Market those Directives should be repealed and replaced by a single legal instrument, in the interests of clarity.</p><p>(2) The Community legislation on fertilisers is very technical in its content. A Regulation is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument, as it imposes directly on manufacturers precise requirements to be applied at the same time and in the same manner throughout the Community.</p><p>(3) In each Member State fertilisers must display certain technical characteristics laid down by mandatory provisions. These provisions, concerning more particularly the composition and definition types of fertilisers, the designations of these types, their identification and their packaging, differ from one Member State to another. By their disparity they hinder trade within the Community and should therefore be harmonised.</p><p>(4) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely to ensure the internal market in fertilisers, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States if there are no common technical criteria and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.</p><p>(5) It is necessary to determine at Community level the designation, definition and composition of certain fertilisers (EC fertilisers).</p><p>(6) Community rules on the identification, traceability and labelling of EC fertilisers and on the closure of the packages should also be laid down.</p><p>(7) A procedure should be established at Community level to be followed in cases where a Member State deems it necessary to restrict the placing on the market of EC fertilisers.</p><p>(8) The production of fertilisers is subject to varying degrees of fluctuation due to manufacturing techniques or basic materials. Sampling and analytical procedures may also contain variations. It is therefore necessary to authorise tolerances on the declared nutrient contents. In the interest of the agricultural user, it is advisable to keep these tolerances within narrow limits.</p><p>(9) Official controls on the compliance of EC fertilisers with requirements of this Regulation concerning quality and composition should be carried out by laboratories that are approved by the Member States and notified to the Commission.</p><p>(10) Ammonium nitrate is the essential ingredient of a variety of products, some of which are intended for use as fertilisers and others as explosives. It is necessary, having regard to the particular nature of ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content and to the consequent requirements regarding public safety, health and protection of workers, to lay down additional Community rules for EC fertilisers of this type.</p><p>(11) Certain of those products could be hazardous and could in certain instances be used for purposes other than those for which they were intended. This could well endanger the security of persons and property. Manufacturers should therefore be obliged to take appropriate steps to avoid such use, and in particular to ensure the traceability of such fertilisers.</p><p>(12) In the interest of public safety, it is particularly important to determine at Community level the characteristics and properties distinguishing ammonium nitrate EC fertilisers of high nitrogen content from varieties of ammonium nitrate used in the manufacture of products used as explosives.</p><p>(13) Ammonium nitrate EC fertilisers of high nitrogen content should conform to certain characteristics to ensure that they are harmless. Manufacturers should ensure that all high nitrogen content ammonium nitrate fertilisers have passed a test of resistance to detonation before those fertilisers are placed on the market.</p><p>(14) It is necessary to establish rules on the methods of the closed thermal cycles even if these methods may not necessarily simulate all conditions arising during transport and storage.</p><p>(15) Fertilisers can be contaminated by substances that can potentially pose a risk to human and animal health and the environment. Further to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (SCTEE), the Commission intends to address the issue of unintentional cadmium content in mineral fertilisers and will, where appropriate, draw up a proposal for a Regulation, which it intends to present to the European Parliament and the Council. Where appropriate, a similar review will be undertaken for other contaminants.</p><p>(16) It is appropriate to establish a procedure, to be observed by any manufacturer or its representative that wishes to include a new type of fertiliser in Annex I in order to use the marking &quot;EC fertiliser&quot;.</p><p>(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8).</p><p>(18) Member States should lay down penalties in respect of infringements of the provisions of this Regulation. They may provide that a manufacturer which infringes Article 27 can be fined an amount equivalent to ten times the market value of the shipment that fails to comply.</p><p>(19) Directives 76/116/EEC, 77/535/EEC, 80/876/EEC and 87/94/EEC should be repealed,</p><p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p><p></p><p>TITLE I</p><p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><p>CHAPTER I</p><p>Scope and definitions</p><p>Article 1</p><p>Scope</p><p>This Regulation shall apply to products which are placed on the market as fertilisers designated &quot;EC fertiliser&quot;.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:</p><p>(a) &quot;Fertiliser&quot; means material, the main function of which is to provide nutrients for plants.</p><p>(b) &quot;Primary nutrient&quot; means the elements nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium only.</p><p>(c) &quot;Secondary nutrient&quot; means the elements calcium, magnesium, sodium and sulphur.</p><p>(d) &quot;Micro-nutrients&quot; means the elements boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc, essential for plant growth in quantities that are small compared with those of primary and secondary nutrients.</p><p>(e) &quot;Inorganic fertiliser&quot; means a fertiliser in which the declared nutrients are in the form of minerals obtained by extraction or by physical and/or chemical industrial processes.

Methods of checking compliance with the limits specified in Annexes III-1 and III-2</p><p>Method 1 Methods for the application of thermal cycles</p><p>1. Scope and field of application</p><p>This document defines the procedures for the application of thermal cycles prior to the execution of the oil retention test for straight ammonium nitrate fertilisers of high nitrogen content and of the test on the resistance to detonation for both, straight and compound ammonium nitrate fertiliser of high nitrogen content.</p><p>The methods of the closed thermal cycles as described in this section are regarded as simulating sufficiently the conditions to be taken into account within the scope of application of title II, chapter IV, however, these methods may not necessarily simulate all conditions arising during transport and storage;</p><p>2. Thermal cycles referred to in Annex III-1</p><p>2.1. Field of application</p><p>This procedure is for thermal cycling prior to determining the oil retention of the fertiliser.</p><p>2.2. Principle and definition</p><p>In an Erlenmeyer flask, heat the sample from ambient temperature to 50 °C and maintain at this temperature for a period of two hours (phase at 50 °C). Thereupon cool the sample until a temperature of 25 °C is achieved and maintain at that temperature for two hours (phase at 25 °C). The combination of the successive phases at 50 °C and 25 °C forms one thermal cycle. After being subjected to two thermal cycles, the test sample is held at a temperature of 20 ±3 °C for the determination of the oil retention value.</p><p>2.3. Apparatus</p><p>Normal laboratory apparatus, in particular:</p><p>- water baths thermostated at 25 (± 1) and 50 (± 1) °C respectively,</p><p>- Erlenmeyer flasks with an individual capacity of 150 ml.</p><p>2.4. Procedure</p><p>Put each test sample of 70 (± 5) grams into an Erlenmeyer flask which is then sealed with a stopper.</p><p>Move each flask every two hours from the 50 °C bath to the 25 °C bath and vice versa.</p><p>Maintain the water in each bath at constant temperature and keep in motion by rapid stirring to ensure the water level comes above the level of the sample. Protect the stopper from condensation by a foam rubber cap.</p><p>3. Thermal cycles to be used for Annex III-2</p><p>3.1. Field of application</p><p>This procedure is for thermal cycling prior to the execution of the detonability test.</p><p>3.2. Principle and definition</p><p>In a watertight box heat the sample from ambient temperature to 50 °C and maintain at this temperature for a period of one hour (phase at 50 °C). Thereupon cool the sample until a temperature of 25 °C is achieved and maintain at that temperature for one hour (phase at 25 °C). The combination of the successive phases at 50 °C and 25 °C forms one thermal cycle. After being subjected to the required number of thermal cycles, the test sample is held at a temperature of 20 ±3 °C pending the execution of the detonability test.</p><p>3.3. Apparatus</p><p>- A water bath, thermostated in a temperature range of 20 to 51 °C with a minimum heating and cooling rate of 10 °C/h, or two water baths, one thermostated at a temperature of 20 °C, the other at 51 °C. The water in the bath(s) is continuously stirred; the volume of the bath should be large enough to guarantee ample circulation of the water.</p><p>- A stainless steel box, watertight all around and provided with a thermocouple in the centre. The outside width of the box is 45 (± 2) mm and the wall thickness is 1,5 mm (see Figure 1). The height and length of the box can be chosen to suit the dimensions of the water bath, e.g. length 600 mm, height 400 mm.</p><p>3.4. Procedure</p><p>Place a quantity of fertilisers sufficient for a single detonation into the box and close the cover. Place the box in the water bath. Heat the water to 51 °C and measure the temperature in the centre of the fertiliser. One hour after the temperature at the centre has reached 50 °C cool the water. One hour after the temperature at the centre has reached 25 °C heat the water to start the second cycle. In the case of two water baths, transfer the box to the other bath after each heating/cooling period.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>&gt;PIC FILE= &quot;L_2003304EN.005501.TIF&quot;&gt;</p><p>Method 2 Determination of oil retention</p><p>1.

Cover the beaker with a watch glass and leave to stand for one hour at 25 (± 2) °C.</p><p>6.3. Filter the entire contents of the beaker through the funnel (5.3) containing the test sieve (5.4). Allow the portion retained by the sieve to remain there for one hour so that most of the excess oil can drain away.</p><p>6.4. Lay two sheets of filter paper (5.5) (about 500 × 500 mm) on top of each other on a smooth surface; fold the four edges of both filter papers upwards to a width of about 40 mm to prevent the prills from rolling away. Place two layers of absorbent tissue (5.6) in the centre of the filter papers. Pour the entire contents of the sieve (5.4) over the absorbent tissues and spread the prills evenly with a soft, flat brush. After two minutes lift one side of the tissues to transfer the prills to the filter papers beneath and spread them evenly over these with the brush. Lay another sheet of filter paper, similarly with its edges turned upward, on the sample and roll the prills between the filter papers with circular movements while exerting a little pressure. Pause after every eight circular movements to lift the opposite edges of the filter papers and return to the centre the prills that have rolled to the periphery. Keep to the following procedure: make four complete circular movements, first clockwise and then anticlockwise. Then roll the prills back to the centre as described above. This procedure to be carried out three times (24 circular movements, edges lifted twice). Carefully insert a new sheet of filter paper between the bottom sheet and the one above it and allow the prills to roll onto the new sheet by lifting the edges of the upper sheet. Cover the prills with a new sheet of filter paper and repeat the same procedure as described above. Immediately after rolling, pour the prills into a tared dish and reweigh to the nearest 0,01 gram to determine the mass of the quantity of gas oil retained.</p><p>6.5. Repeating the rolling procedure and reweighing</p><p>If the quantity of gas oil retained in the portion is found to be greater than 2 grams, place the portion on a fresh set of filter papers and repeat the rolling procedure, lifting the corners in accordance with section 6.4 (two times eight circular movements, lifting once). Then reweigh the portion.</p><p>7. Expression of the results</p><p>7.1.

Procedure</p><p>5.1. Sample for analysis</p><p>Weigh approximately 10 grams of ammonium nitrate to the nearest 0,001 grams.</p><p>5.2. Removal of carbonates</p><p>Place the sample for analysis in the reaction flask B. Add 100 ml of H2SO4(3.2). The prills dissolve in about 10 minutes at ambient temperature. Assemble the apparatus as indicated in the diagram: connect one end of the absorption tube (A) to the nitrogen source (4.2) via a non-return flow device containing a pressure equivalent to 5 to 6 mm of mercury and the other end to the feed tube which enters the reaction flask. Place the Vigreux fractionating column (C&#039;) and the condenser (C) with cooling water supply in position. Adjust the nitrogen to provide a moderate flow through the solution, bring the solution to boiling point and heat for two minutes. At the end of this time there should be no more effervescence. If effervescence is seen, continue heating for 30 minutes. Allow solution to cool for at least 20 minutes with the nitrogen flowing through it.</p><p>Complete assembly of the apparatus as indicated in the diagram by connecting the condenser tube to the Drechsel bottle (D) and the bottle to the absorption vessels F1 and F2. The nitrogen must continue to pass through the solution during the assembly operation. Rapidly introduce 50 ml of barium hydroxide solution (3.4) into each of the absorption vessels (F1 and F2).</p><p>Bubble a stream of nitrogen through for about 10 minutes. The solution must remain clear in the absorbers. If this does not happen, the carbonate removal process must be repeated.</p><p>5.3. Oxidation and absorption</p><p>After withdrawing the nitrogen feed tube, rapidly introduce 20 grams of chromium trioxide (3.1) and 6 ml of silver nitrate solution (3.3) via the side arm of the reaction flask (B). Connect the apparatus to the suction pump and adjust the nitrogen flow so that a steady stream of gas bubbles passes through the sintered-glass absorbers F1 and F2.</p><p>Heat the reaction flask (B) until the liquid boils and keep it boiling for one and a half hours(1). It may be necessary to adjust the suction-regulating valve (G) to control the nitrogen flow since it is possible that the barium carbonate precipitated during the test may block the sintered-glass discs. The operation is satisfactory when the barium hydroxide solution in the absorber F2 remains clear. Otherwise repeat the test. Stop heating and dismantle the apparatus. Wash each of the distributors (3.10) both inside and outside to remove barium hydroxide and collect the washings in the corresponding absorber. Place the distributors one after the other in a 600-ml beaker which will subsequently be used for the determination.</p><p>Rapidly filter under vacuum firstly the contents of absorber F2 and then of absorber F1 using the sintered-glass crucible. Collect the precipitate by rinsing the absorbers with water (3.10) and wash the crucible with 50 ml of the same water. Place the crucible in the 600-ml beaker and add about 100 ml of boiled water (3.10). Introduce 50 ml of boiled water into each of the absorbers and pass nitrogen through the distributors for five minutes. Combine the water with that from the beaker. Repeat the operation once to ensure that the distributors are rinsed thoroughly.</p><p>5.4. Measurement of the carbonates originating from organic material</p><p>Add five drops of phenolphthalein (3.8) to the contents of the beaker. The solution becomes red in colour. Add hydrochloric acid (3.5) drop by drop until the pink colour just disappears. Stir the solution well in the crucible to check that the pink colour does not reappear. Add five drops of bromphenol blue (3.7) and titrate with hydrochloric acid (3.5) until the solution turns yellow. Add a further 10 ml of hydrochloric acid.</p><p>Heat the solution to boiling point and continue boiling for a maximum of one minute. Check carefully that no precipitate remains in the liquid.</p><p>Allow to cool and back titrate with the sodium hydroxide solution (3.6).</p><p>6.

Preparation of booster charge for insertion into steel tube</p><p>There are two methods of initiation of the explosive in the booster charge, depending on the availability of equipment.</p><p>4.4.1.1. Seven-point simultaneous initiation</p><p>The booster charge prepared for use is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>4.4.1.1.1. Drill holes in the wooden disc (4.3.10) parallel to the axis of the disc through the centre and through six points symmetrically distributed around a concentric circle 55 mm in diameter. The diameter of the holes must be 6 to 7 mm (see Section A-B in Figure 1), depending on the diameter of the detonating cord used (4.3.2).</p><p>4.4.1.1.2. Cut seven lengths of flexible detonating cord (4.3.2) each 400 mm long, avoiding any loss of explosive at each end by making a clean cut and immediately sealing the end with adhesive. Push each of the seven lengths through the seven holes in the wooden disc (4.3.10) until their ends project a few centimetres on the other side of the disc. Then insert a small dressmaking pin (4.3.12) transversally into the textile sleeve of each length of cord 5 to 6 mm from the end and apply adhesive around the outside of the lengths of cord in a band 2 cm wide adjacent to the pin. Finally, pull the long piece of each cord to bring the pin into contact with the wooden disc.</p><p>4.4.1.1.3. Shape the plastic explosive (4.3.1) to form a cylinder 92 to 96 mm in diameter, depending on the diameter of the cylinder (4.3.8). Stand this cylinder upright on a level surface and insert the shaped explosive. Then insert the wooden disc(4) carrying the seven lengths of detonating cord into the top of the cylinder and press it down onto the explosive. Adjust the height of the cylinder (64 to 67 mm) so that its top edge does not extend beyond the level of the wood. Finally, fix the cylinder to the wooden disc for instance with staples or small nails, around its entire circumference.</p><p>4.4.1.1.4. Group the free ends of the seven lengths of detonating cord around the circumference of the wooden rod (4.3.11) so that their ends are all level in a plane perpendicular to the rod. Secure them in a bundle around the rod by means of adhesive tape(5).</p><p>4.4.1.2. Central initiation by a compressed pellet</p><p>The booster charge prepared for use is shown in Figure 2.</p><p>4.4.1.2.1. Preparing a compressed pellet</p><p>Taking the necessary safety precautions, place 10 grams of a secondary explosive (4.3.3) in a mould with an inside diameter of 19 to 21 mm and compress to the correct shape and density.</p><p>(The ratio of diameter: height should be roughly 1:1).</p><p>In the centre of the bottom of the mould there is a peg, 12 mm in height and 7,0 to 7,3 mm in diameter (depending on the diameter of the detonator used), which forms a cylindrical recess in the compressed cartridge for subsequent insertion of the detonator.</p><p>4.4.1.2.2. Preparing the booster charge</p><p>Place the explosive (4.3.1) into the cylinder (4.3.8) standing upright on a level surface, then press it down with a wooden die to give the explosive a cylindrical shape with a central recess. Insert the compressed pellet into this recess. Cover the cylindrically shaped explosive containing the compressed pellet with a wooden disc (4.3.10) having a central hole 7,0 to 7,3 mm in diameter for insertion of a detonator. Fix the wooden disc and the cylinder together with a cross of adhesive tape. Ensure that the hole drilled in the disc and the recess in the compressed pellet are coaxial by inserting the wooden rod (4.3.11).</p><p>4.4.2. Preparing steel tubes for the detonation tests</p><p>At one end of the steel tube (4.3.4), drill two diametrically opposed holes 4 mm in diameter perpendicularly through the side wall at a distance of 4 mm from the edge.</p><p>Butt weld the bottom plate (4.3.5) to the opposite end of the tube, completely filling the right angle between the bottom place and the wall of the tube with weld metal around the entire circumference of the tube.</p><p>4.4.3. Filling and charging the steel tube</p><p>See Figures 1 and 2.</p><p>4.4.3.1. The test sample, the steel tube and the booster charge must be conditioned to temperatures of 20 (± 5) °C. 16 to 18 kg of the test sample are needed for two detonation tests.</p><p>4.4.3.2. Place the tube upright with its square bottom place resting on a firm, flat surface, preferably concrete. Fill the tube to about one-third of its height with the test sample and drop it 10 cm vertically onto the floor five times to compact the prills or granules as densely as possible in the tube. To accelerate compaction, vibrate the tube by striking the side wall with a 750 to 1000-gram hammer between drops for a total of 10 times.</p><p>Repeat this charging method with another portion of the test sample. Finally, a further addition shall be made such that, after compaction by raising and dropping the tube 10 times and a total of 20 intermittent hammer blows, the charge fills the tube to a distance of 70 mm from its orifice.</p><p>The filling height of the sample must be adjusted in the steel tube so that the booster charge (4.4.1.1 or 4.4.1.2) to be inserted later will be in close contact with the sample over its entire surface.</p><p>4.4.3.3. Insert the booster charge into the tube so that it is in contact with the sample; the top surface of the wooden disc must be 6 mm below the end of the tube. Ensure essential close contact between explosive and test sample by adding or removing small quantities of sample. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, split pins should be inserted through the holes near the open end of the tube and their legs opened flat against the tube.</p><p>4.4.4. Positioning of the steel tube and lead cylinders (see figure 3)</p><p>4.4.4.1. Number the bases of the lead cylinders (4.3.6) 1 to 6. Make six marks 150 mm apart on the centre line of a steel block (4.3.7) lying on a horizontal base, with the first mark at least 75 mm from the edge of the block. Place a lead cylinder upright on each of these marks, with the base of each cylinder centred on its mark.</p><p>4.4.4.2. Lay the steel tube prepared according to 4.4.3 horizontally on the lead cylinders so that the axis of the tube is parallel to the centre line of the steel block and the welded end of the tube extends 50 mm beyond lead cylinder No 6. To prevent the tube from rolling, insert small wooden wedges between the tops of the lead cylinders and the tube wall (one on each side) or place a cross of wood between the tube and the steel block.</p><p>Note:</p><p>Make sure that the tube is in contact with all six lead cylinders; a slight curvature of the tube surface can be compensated for by rotating the tube about its longitudinal axis; if any of the lead cylinders is too tall, tap the cylinder in question carefully with a hammer until it is the required height.</p><p>4.4.5. Preparation for detonation</p><p>4.4.5.1. Set up the apparatus according to the 4.4.4 in a bunker or suitably prepared underground site (e.g. mine or tunnel). Ensure that the temperature of the steel tube is kept at 20 (± 5) °C before detonation.</p><p>Note:</p><p>Should such firing sites not be available, the work can, if necessary, be done in a concrete-lined pit covered over with wooden beams. Detonation can cause steel fragments to be projected with high kinetic energy, therefore, firing must be carried out at a suitable distance from dwellings or thoroughfares.</p><p>4.4.5.2. If the booster charge with seven-point initiation is used, ensure that the detonation cords are stretched out as described in the footnote to 4.4.1.1.4 and arranged as horizontally as possible.</p><p>4.4.5.3. Finally, remove the wooden rod and replace with the detonator. Do not carry out firing until the danger zone has been evacuated and the test personnel have taken cover.</p><p>4.4.5.4. Detonate the explosive.</p><p>4.4.6. Allow sufficient time for the fumes (gaseous and sometimes toxic decomposition products such as nitrous gases) to disperse, then collect the lead cylinders and measure their heights with a Vernier caliper</p><p>Record for each of the marked lead cylinders, the degree of crushing expressed as a percentage of the original height of 100 mm. If the cylinders are crushed obliquely, record the highest and the lowest values and calculate the average.</p><p>4.4.7. A probe for continuous measurement of the detonation velocity can be used; the probe should be inserted longitudinally to the axis of the tube or along its side wall</p><p>4.4.8. Two detonation tests per sample are to be carried out</p><p>4.5. Test report</p><p>Values for the following parameters are to be given in the test report for each of the detonation tests:</p><p>- the values actually measures for the outside diameter of the steel tube and for the wall thickness,</p><p>- the Brinell hardness of the steel tube,</p><p>- the temperature of the tube and the sample shortly before firing,</p><p>- the packing density (kg/m3) of the sample in the steel tube,</p><p>- the height of each lead cylinder after firing, specifying the corresponding cylinder number,</p><p>- method of initiation employed for the booster charge.</p><p>4.5.1. Evaluation of test results</p><p>If, in each firing, the crushing of at least one lead cylinder is less than 5 %, the test shall be considered conclusive and the sample in conformity with the requirements of Annex III.2.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>&gt;PIC FILE= &quot;L_2003304EN.007001.TIF&quot;&gt;</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>&gt;PIC FILE= &quot;L_2003304EN.007101.TIF&quot;&gt;</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>&gt;PIC FILE= &quot;L_2003304EN.007201.TIF&quot;&gt;</p><p></p><p>(1) A reaction time of one and a half hours, is sufficient in the case of most of the organic substances in the presence of silver nitrate catalyst.</p><p>(2) Commercially available standard copper solution may be used.</p><p>(3) Whatman 541 or equivalent.</p><p>(4) The diameter of the disc must always correspond to the inside diameter of the cylinder.</p><p>(5) NB:</p><p>When the six peripheral lengths of cord are taut after assembly, the central cord must remain slightly slack.</p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX IV</p><p></p><p>METHODS OF SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS</p><p>A. METHOD OF SAMPLING FOR THE CONTROL OF FERTILISERS</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Correct sampling is a difficult operation which requires the greatest of care. The need to obtain a sufficiently representative sample for the official testing of fertilisers cannot, therefore, be stressed too much.</p><p>The sampling method described below must be applied with strict accuracy by specialists with experience of the conventional sampling procedure.</p><p>1.

Instructions for taking, preparing and packaging the samples</p><p>6.1. General</p><p>The samples must be taken and prepared as quickly as possible bearing in mind the precautions necessary to ensure that they remain representative of the fertiliser sampled. Instruments and also surfaces and containers intended to receive samples must be clean and dry.</p><p>In the case of fluid fertilisers, if possible the sampled portion should be mixed prior to sampling.</p><p>6.2. Incremental samples</p><p>Incremental samples must be taken at random throughout the whole sampled portion and they must be of approximately equal sizes.</p><p>6.2.1. Loose solid fertilisers or fluid fertilisers in containers exceeding 100 kg</p><p>An imaginary division shall be made of the sampled portion into a number of approximately equal parts. A number of parts corresponding to the number of incremental samples required in accordance with 5.2 shall be selected at random and at least one sample taken from each of these parts. Where it is not possible to comply with the requirements of 5.1 when sampling bulk fertilisers or fluid fertilisers in containers exceeding 100 kg the sampling should be carried out when the sampled portion is being moved (loading or unloading). In this case samples shall be taken from the randomly selected notional parts as defined above while these are being moved.</p><p>6.2.2. Packaged solid fertilisers or fluid fertilisers in containers (= packages) each not exceeding 100 kg</p><p>Having selected the required number of packages for sampling as indicated in 5.2, part of the contents of each package shall be removed.

Destination of samples</p><p>For each sample portion at least one final sample shall be sent as quickly as possible to an authorised analytical laboratory or to the test institution, together with the information necessary for the analysis or the test.</p><p>B. METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF FERTILISERS</p><p>(See table of contents p. 2.)</p><p>General observations</p><p>Laboratory equipment</p><p>In the descriptions of the methods, general laboratory equipment has not been precisely defined, except that the sizes of flasks and pipettes are given. In all cases laboratory apparatus must be well cleaned, particularly when small quantities of elements are to be determined.</p><p>Control tests</p><p>Before analysis it is necessary to ensure that all apparatus functions well and that the analytical technique is carried out correctly, using where appropriate chemical compounds of known composition (e.g. ammonium sulphate, mono potassium phosphate, etc.). Nevertheless, the results from analysed fertilisers can indicate wrong chemical composition if the analytical technique is not rigorously followed. On the other hand, a certain number of determinations are empirical and are relative to products of complex chemical composition. It is recommended that where available, laboratories should make use of standard reference fertilisers of well defined composition.</p><p>General provisions relating to methods of analysing fertilisers</p><p>1. Reagents</p><p>Unless otherwise specified in the method of analysis, all of the reagents must be analysis-pur (a.p.). Where micro-nutrients are to be analysed the purity of the reagents must be checked by means of a blank test. Depending upon the result obtained, it might be necessary to conduct a further purification.</p><p>2. Water</p><p>Where dissolution, dilution, rinsing or washing operations referred to in the methods of analysis do not specify the nature of solvents or diluents the use of water is implied. Normally, the water will have to be demineralised or distilled. In these specific instances, as mentioned in the method of analysis, that water will have to be subjected to specific purification processes.</p><p>3. Laboratory equipment</p><p>In view of the equipment normally used in inspection laboratories, the apparatus described in the methods of analysis is restricted to special instruments and apparatus or to such demanded by any specific requirements. This equipment must be perfectly clean, above all where small quantities are to be determined. The laboratory will have to ensure the accuracy of any graduated glassware used by referring to appropriate metrological standards.</p><p>Method 1</p><p>Preparation of the sample for analysis</p><p>1. Scope</p><p>This document defines the procedure for the preparation of the sample for analysis, taken from the final sample.</p><p>2. Principle</p><p>The preparation of a final sample received at the laboratory is a series of operations, usually sieving, grinding and mixing, carried out in such a way that:</p><p>- on the one hand, the smallest amount weighed out laid down by the methods of analysis is representative of the laboratory sample,</p><p>- on the other hand, the fineness of the fertiliser cannot have been changed by the preparation to the extent that its solubility in the various extraction reagents is appreciably affected.</p><p>3. Apparatus</p><p>Sample divider (optional).</p><p>Sieves with apertus of 0,2 and 0,5 mm.</p><p>250-ml flasks, stoppered.</p><p>Porcelain pestle and mortar or grinder.</p><p>4. Choice of treatment to be used</p><p>Preliminary remark</p><p>If the product is suitable, only a representative part of the final sample need be kept.</p><p>4.1. Final samples which must not be ground</p><p>Calcium nitrate, calcium magnesium nitrate, sodium nitrate, Chile nitrate, calcium cyanamide, nitrogenous calcium cyanamide, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrates of over 30 % N, urea, basic slag, natural phosphate rendered partially soluble, precipitated dihydrated dicalcium phosphate, calcined phosphate, aluminium calcium phosphate, soft ground rock phosphate.</p><p>4.2. Final samples which must be divided and part of which must be ground</p><p>These are products in respect of which certain determinations are carried out without previous grinding (fineness of grinding for example) and other determinations after grinding. They include all compound fertilisers containing the following phosphate ingredients: basic slag, aluminium calcium phosphate, calcined phosphate, soft ground rock phosphate and natural phosphate rendered partially soluble. To that end, divide the final sample into two parts, which are as identical as possible, using a sample divider or by quartering.</p><p>4.3. Final samples in respect of which all determinations are carried out on a ground product</p><p>Only a representative part of the final sample need be ground. These are all the other fertilisers on the list which are not to be found under 4.1 and 4.2.</p><p>5. Method</p><p>The part of the final sample referred to under 4.2 and 4.3 is sieved rapidly through a sieve with apertures of 0,5 mm. The residue is ground roughly so as to obtain a product in which there is a minimum of fine particles, and it is then sieved. The grinding must be done in conditions such that the substance is not appreciably heated. The operation is repeated as many times as is necessary until there is no residue, and it must be effected as quickly as possible in order to prevent any gain or loss of constituents (water, ammonia). The whole ground and sieved product is placed in a clean flask which can be stoppered.</p><p>Before any weighing is carried out for the analysis, the whole sample must be thoroughly mixed.</p><p>6. Special cases</p><p>(a) Fertilisers comprising a blend of several categories of crystals</p><p>In this case, separation frequently occurs. It is therefore absolutely essential to crush and pass the sample through a sieve with apertures of 0,200 mm. For example: mixtures of ammonium phosphate and potassium nitrate. The grinding of the whole of the final sample is recommended in the case of these products.</p><p>(b) Residue which is difficult to grind and does not contain fertilising substances</p><p>Weigh the residue and take account of its mass when calculating the final result.</p><p>(c) Products which decompose on heating</p><p>Grinding must be carried out in such a way as to avoid any heating. It is preferable in this case to use a mortar for grinding. For example: compound fertilisers containing calcium cyanamide and urea.</p><p>(d) Products which are abnormally moist or made into a paste by grinding</p><p>To ensure homogeneity, a sieve is to be chosen which has the smallest apertures compatible with the destruction of lumps by hand or with the pestle. This may be the case of mixtures, certain ingredients of which contain water of crystallisation.</p><p>Methods 2</p><p>Nitrogen</p><p>Method 2.1</p><p>Determination of ammoniacal nitrogen</p><p>1. Scope</p><p>This document defines the procedure for the determination of the ammoniacal nitrogen.</p><p>2. Field of application</p><p>All nitrogenous fertilisers, including compound fertilisers, in which nitrogen is found exclusively either in the form of ammonium salts, or ammonium salts together with nitrates.</p><p>It is not applicable to fertilisers containing urea, cyanamide or other organic nitrogenous compounds.</p><p>3. Principle</p><p>Displacement of ammonia by means of an excess of sodium hydroxide; distillation; determining the yield of ammonia in a given volume of a standard sulphuric acid and titration of the excess acid by means of a standard solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide.</p><p>4. Reagents</p><p>Distilled or demineralised water, free from carbon dioxide and all nitrogenous compounds.</p><p>4.1. Diluted hydrochloric acid: one volume of HCl (d20 = 1,18 g/ml) plus one volume of water</p><p>&gt;TABLE&gt;</p><p>4.8. Sodium hydroxide, approximately 30 % NaOH (d20 = 1,33 g/ml), ammonia free</p><p>4.9. Indicator solutions</p><p>4.9.1. Mixed indicator</p><p>Solution A: Dissolve 1 g of methyl red in 37 ml of sodium hydroxide solution 0,1 mol/l and make up to one litre with water.</p><p>Solution B: Dissolve 1 g of methylene blue in water and make up to one litre.</p><p>Mix one volume of A with two volumes of B.</p><p>This indicator is violet in acid solution, grey in neutral solution and green in alkaline solution. Use 0,5 ml (10 drops) of this indicator solution.</p><p>4.9.2. Methyl red indicator solution</p><p>Dissolve 0,1 g of methyl red in 50 ml of 95 % ethanol. Make up to 100 ml with water and filter if necessary. This indicator may be used (four to five drops) instead of the preceding one.</p><p>4.10. Anti-bump granules of pumice stone, washed in hydrochloric acid and calcined</p><p>4.11. Ammonium sulphate for analysis</p><p>5. Apparatus</p><p>5.1. Distillation apparatus consisting of a round-bottomed flask of suitable capacity connected to a condenser by means of a splash head</p><p>Note 1</p><p>The different types of equipment approved and recommended for this determination are reproduced, showing all the features of construction, in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p><p>5.2. Pipettes of 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 200 ml</p><p>5.3. A 500-ml graduated flask</p><p>5.4. Rotary shaker (35 to 40 turns per minute)</p><p>6. Preparation of the sample</p><p>See Method 1.</p><p>7. Method of analysis</p><p>7.1. Preparation of the solution</p><p>Carry out a solubility test on the sample in water at room temperature and in the proportion of 2 % (W/V). Weigh to 0,001 g, according to the indications in Table 1, a quantity of 5 or 7 or 10 g of the prepared sample and place it in a 500-ml graduated flask. According to the result of the solubility test, proceed as follows:</p><p>(a) Products completely soluble in water</p><p>Add to the flask the quantity of water needed to dissolve the sample; shake, and when completely dissolved, make up the volume and mix thoroughly.</p><p>(b) Products not completely soluble in water</p><p>Add to the flask 50 ml of water and then 20 ml of hydrochloric acid (4.1). Shake. Leave undisturbed until the evolution of carbon dioxide has ceased. Add 400 ml of water and shake for half an hour with the rotary shaker (5.4). Make up the volume with water, mix and filter through a dry filter into a dry receptacle.</p><p>7.2. Analysis of the solution</p><p>According to the variant chosen, place in the receiving flask a measured quantity of standard sulphuric acid as indicated in Table 1. Add the appropriate quantity of the chosen indicator solution (4.9.1 or 4.9.2) and, if necessary, water in order to obtain a volume of at least 50 ml. The end of the extension tube of the condenser must be below the surface of the solution.</p><p>Transfer by precision pipette, according to the details given in the table, an aliquot portion(9) of the clear solution, into the distilling flask of the apparatus. Add water in order to obtain a total volume of about 350 ml, and several grains of pumice in order to control the boiling.</p><p>Assemble the distillation apparatus, and taking care to avoid any loss of ammonia, add to the contents of the distillation flask 10 ml of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution (4.8) or 20 ml of the reagent in the cases where one has used 20 ml hydrochloric acid (4.1) in order to dissolve the test sample. Gradually warm the flask, to avoid boiling vigorously. When boiling commences, distil at the rate of about 100 ml in 10 to 15 minutes; the total volume of distillate should be about 250 ml(10). When no more ammonia is likely to be evolved, lower the receiving flask so that the tip of the condenser extension is above the surface of the liquid.</p><p>Test the subsequent distillate by means of an appropriate reagent to ensure that all the ammonia is completely distilled.

The best arrangement consists of small mushroom-shaped pieces with an external diameter of 20 mm and six openings of 1 mm around the periphery.</p><p>5.3.

Add 10 to 15 g of potassium sulphate (4.1), the catalyst (4.27), and a few anti-bump granules (4.28). Then add 50 ml of dilute sulphuric acid (4.7), and mix thoroughly. First heat gently mixing from time to time, until foam no longer forms. Then heat so that the liquid boils regularly and keep it boiling for one hour after the solution has become clear, preventing any organic matter from sticking to the sides of the flask. Allow to cool. Carefully add about 350 ml of water, with mixing. Ensure that the dissolution is as complete as possible. Allow to cool and connect the flask to the distillation apparatus (5.1).</p><p>7.1.1.2. Distillation of ammonia</p><p>Transfer with a precision pipette, into the receiver of the apparatus, 50 ml of a standard solution of sulphuric acid 0,2 mol/l (4.8). Add the indicator (4.29.1 or 4.29.2). Ensure that the tip of the condenser is at least 1 cm below the level of the solution.</p><p>Taking the necessary precautions to avoid any loss of ammonia, carefully add to the distillation flasks enough of the concentrated sodium hydroxide solution (4.9) to make the liquid strongly alkaline (120 ml is generally sufficient; check by adding a few drops of phenolphthalein. At the end of the distillation the solution in the flask must still be clearly alkaline). Adjust the heating of the flask so as to distil 150 ml in half an hour. Test with indicator paper (4.30) that the distillation has been completed. If it has not, distil a further 50 ml and repeat the test until the supplementary distillate reacts neutrally to the indicator paper (4.30). Then lower the receiver, distil a few millilitres more and rinse the tip of the condenser. Titrate the excess of acid with a standard solution of potassium or sodium hydroxide 0,2 mol/l (4.10) until the indicator changes colour.</p><p>7.1.1.3.

Then continue heating for one hour after obtaining a clear solution, maintaining it at simmering point. Leave to cool. Cautiously take the contents of the flask up in a little water and add little by little 100 ml of water. Mix and transfer the contents of the flask into a 500-ml graduated flask.

Pipette, into the 300-ml Erlenmeyer, 50 ml of the standard sulphuric acid solution 0,1 mol/l (4.17) and enough distilled water for the level of the liquid to be approximately 5 cm above the opening of the delivery tube. Introduce, through the side neck of the reaction flask, distilled water so as to make up the volume to about 50 ml. Mix. To avoid foaming during aeration, add a few drops of octyl alcohol (4.18). Then make the solution alkaline by using 50 ml of saturated potassium carbonate solution (4.19) and immediately begin to expel the ammonia thus liberated from the cold suspension. The strong current of air necessary to that end (flow of approximately three litres per minute) is purified beforehand by passing it through washing flasks containing dilute sulphuric acid and dilute sodium hydroxide. Instead of using pressurised air, it is also possible to work in a vacuum (water pump) provided that the inflow tube is connected in a sufficiently airtight manner to the receptacle used to recover the ammonia. The elimination of the ammonia is generally complete after three hours. It is nevertheless wise to make sure of that by changing the receiving flask. When the operation is finished, separate the flask from the apparatus, rinse the tip of the tube and the sides of the flask with a little distilled water.

Ammoniacal nitrogen</p><p>7.5.1. Analysis</p><p>Pipette into the dry flask of the apparatus (5.2) a portion of filtrate (7.1) containing a maximum of 20 mg of ammoniacal N. Connect up the apparatus. Pipette into the 300-ml Erlenmeyer exactly 50 ml of titrated 0,1 mol/l sulphuric acid solution (4.14) and an amount of distilled water so that the level of the liquid is approximately 5 cm above the opening of the intake tube. Introduce through the side neck of the reaction flask, distilled water so as to bring the volume to approximately 50 ml. Shake. In order to avoid the formation of froth on the introduction of the gaseous flow, add several drops of octyl alcohol (4.15). Add 50 ml of saturated potassium carbonate solution (4.16), and immediately begin to expel the ammonia thus released from the cold suspension. The intense air flow required for this purpose (flow rate of approximately three litres per minute) is previously purified by passage through washing flasks containing dilute sulphuric acid and dilute sodium hydroxide. Instead of using air under pressure, a vacuum may be used (water suction pump) provided that the connections between the apparatus are air tight.</p><p>The elimination of ammonia is generally completed after three hours.</p><p>However, it is desirable to make certain of this by changing the Erlenmeyer.

Urea nitrogen</p><p>7.6.1. Urease method</p><p>Pipette into a 500-ml graduated flask a portion of filtrate (7.1) containing not more than 250 mg of urea nitrogen. To precipitate phosphates, add a suitable quantity of saturated barium hydroxide solution (4.18) until further addition does not cause the production of more precipitate. Eliminate excess barium ions (and any dissolved calcium ions) by means of 10 % sodium carbonate solution (4.19). Allow to settle and check whether precipitation is complete. Make up to the mark, homogenise, and filter through a folder filter. Pipette 50 ml of filtrate into the 300-ml Erlenmeyer of the apparatus (5.3). Acidify with 2 mol/l hydrochloric acid (4.20) to pH 3,0, measured by means of pH meter. Raise the pH to 5,4 by means of 0,1 mol/l sodium hydroxide (4.17). To avoid ammonia losses when hydrolysis by urease occurs, close the Erlenmeyer by means of a stopper attached to a dropping funnel and a small protective container holding exactly 2 ml of 0,1 mol/l hydrochloric acid solution (4.21). By way of the dropping funnel, introduce 20 ml of urease solution (4.22). Leave for one hour at 20 to 25 °C. Pipette 25 ml of the standard 0,1 mol/l hydrochloric acid solution (4.21) into the dropping funnel, allow to run into the solution, then rinse with a little water. Also transfer quantitatively the contents of the protective container to the solution held in the Erlenmeyer.

Add 10 ml of xanthydrol to the filtrate drop by drop (4.23), stirring continually with a glass rod. Leave it to settle until the precipitate appears, and at that juncture stir again for one to two minutes. Leave for one and a half hours. Filter on a glass filtration crucible, previously dried and weigh, using a slight reduction of pressure; wash three times with 5 ml of ethanol (4.28), without aiming to eliminate all the acetic acid.

Remarks</p><p>10.1. The stoichiometric EDTA-metal ratio in the complexometric analyses is always 1:1 whatever the valency of the metal and in spite of the fact that EDTA is quadrivalent. The EDTA titration solution and the standard solutions will therefore be molar and not normal</p><p>10.2. Complexometric indicators are often sensitive to air. The solution may lose colour during titration. In this case, one or two drops of indicator must be added. This is true particularly in the case of eriochrome black and calcon carbonic acid</p><p>10.3. The metal-indicator complexes are often relatively stable and it may take some time for the colour to change. The last drops of EDTA must therefore be added slowly and a drop of 0,05 mol/l solution of magnesium (4.1) or calcium (4.3) added to ensure that the colour change has not already taken place. This is particularly true in the case of the eriochrome-magnesium complex</p><p>10.4. The turning of the indicator must be observed not vertically, but horizontally across the solution and the beaker must be placed against a white background in a well-lit position. The turning of the indicator may also be observed easily by placing the beaker on frosted glass lit moderately from below (25 watt lamp)</p><p>10.5. This analysis requires a certain amount of experience. The task will involve, inter alia, observing the colour changes of standard solutions 4.1 and 4.3. It is recommended that the determinations be carried out by the same laboratory chemist</p><p>10.6. If an EDTA solution of guaranteed strength is used (Titrisol, Normex, for example) this may simplify the control of the equivalence of standard solutions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3</p><p>10.7. The solutions containing potassium cyanide must not be poured down the sink until the cyanide has been converted into a harmless compound, for example, by oxidization with sodium hypochlorite following alkalisation</p><p>Method 8.9</p><p>Determination of sulphates</p><p>1.
