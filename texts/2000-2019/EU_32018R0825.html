In addition, in investigations where it is not appropriate to impose provisional measures, it is desirable that parties are aware sufficiently in advance of such non-imposition. In order to limit the risk of a substantial rise in imports in the period of pre-disclosure, the Commission should register imports where possible. When providing for registration of imports during the period of pre-disclosure, it is necessary to consider that it requires a prospective analysis of the risks associated and the likelihood that these circumstances would undermine the remedial effects of the measures. Furthermore, the Commission should collect additional statistical information at the level of the Integrated Tariff of the European Union (TARIC) to ensure a proper factual basis of the analysis of the imports. Where registration is not possible, and a further substantial rise in imports takes place during the period of pre-disclosure, the Commission should reflect this additional injury in the injury margin.</p>

Such interference creates additional distortions of trade. As a result, the costs of raw materials do not reflect the operation of normal market forces of supply and demand for a given raw material. As a result, Union producers are not only harmed by dumping, but suffer from additional distortions of trade compared to third-country downstream producers which engage in such practices. In order to adequately protect trade, due regard should be had to such distortions when determining the level of duties to be imposed.</p>

Furthermore, the Commission should also initiate interim reviews in cases of changed circumstances in exporting countries relating to social and environmental standards. For instance, if a country under measures withdraws from multilateral environmental agreements, and protocols thereunder, to which the Union is a party, or from International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions listed in Annex Ia to the Regulations, the interim review investigation could result in the withdrawal of acceptance of the undertakings in force.

Nevertheless, if a substantial rise in imports has not occurred or if the Commission is able to address it, the period of pre-disclosure should be increased in order to ensure predictability for Union operators.
