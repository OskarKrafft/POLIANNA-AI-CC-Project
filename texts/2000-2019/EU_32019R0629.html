References for a preliminary ruling constitute the keystone of the judicial system of the Union and are dealt with expeditiously, and consequently a transfer to the General Court of jurisdiction to hear and determine questions referred for a preliminary ruling, in specific areas laid down by the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, is at present not necessary.</p>

In order to enable the Court of Justice to concentrate on the cases that require its full attention, it is necessary, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, to introduce, for appeals relating to such cases, a procedure whereby the Court of Justice allows an appeal to proceed, wholly or in part, only where it raises an issue that is significant with respect to the unity, consistency or development of Union law.</p>

The component of the request made by the Court of Justice on 26 March 2018 that relates to the partial transfer to the General Court of infringement proceedings should be examined at a later stage, after the report on the functioning of the General Court provided for in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/2422 has been drawn up, in December 2020. It is recalled that this report should focus in particular on the efficiency of the General Court and the necessity and effectiveness of the increase of the number of judges to 56, taking into account also the objective of ensuring gender balance within the General Court as mentioned in the preamble to Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2015/2422.</p>
