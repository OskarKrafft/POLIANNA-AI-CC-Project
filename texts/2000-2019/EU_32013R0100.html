While focusing on its priority tasks in the area of maritime safety, the Agency should receive a number of new core and ancillary tasks reflecting the development of maritime safety policy at Union and international level. Given the budget constraints facing the Union, considerable screening and redeployment efforts are necessary to guarantee cost and budget efficiency and to avoid any overlapping. Staffing needs for the new core and ancillary tasks should, as a matter of principle, be covered through internal redeployment by the Agency. At the same time, the Agency should receive, where appropriate, funding from other parts of the Union budget, in particular from the European Neighbourhood Policy instrument. The delivery of any new core and ancillary tasks by the Agency will be undertaken within the limits of the current Financial Perspective and the Agency’s budget without prejudice to the negotiations and decisions on the future multiannual financial framework. As this Regulation is not a financing decision, the Budgetary Authority should decide on resources for the Agency in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure.</p>

The visits should be conducted in the spirit of the principles referred to in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union and should be conducted in such a way so as to minimise the administrative burden upon the national maritime administrations.
