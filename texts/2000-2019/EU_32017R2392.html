At that Conference, an international agreement (‘the Paris Agreement’) was adopted to strengthen the global response to climate change. The Paris Agreement, inter alia, sets out a long-term goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1,5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement was approved on behalf of the Union by Council Decision (EU) 2016/1841 <a id="ntc3-L_2017350EN.01000701-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_2017350EN.01000701-E0003"

In order to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, all sectors will need to contribute and the Parties will prepare, communicate and maintain successive Nationally Determined Contributions (‘NDCs’). Action should therefore also be taken through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (‘ICAO’) to reduce emissions from international aviation.</p>

Member States have recommitted themselves to implementing the Single European Sky concept, taking account of the expected growth in the volume of air traffic in the coming years. In order to achieve progress with air traffic management, the implementation of Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking needs to be accelerated. Other measures such as the use of GNSS for satellite-based navigation, Joint Technology Initiatives such as Clean Sky I and Clean Sky II and Union research programs, such as Horizon 2020 and its successors, will also contribute to improving efficiency and to reducing aviation emissions.</p>

However, its concrete operationalisation will require action by the ICAO Parties at domestic level. Also, governance arrangements need to be developed by the ICAO, including a registry system. In that context, in order to promote momentum in the ICAO and to facilitate the operationalisation of the ICAO scheme, the current derogation from the EU ETS obligations for flights to and from third countries should be extended until 31 December 2023, subject to review, to allow the experience necessary for the implementation of the ICAO scheme to be gathered. As a result of the extension of the derogation, the amount of allowances to be auctioned and issued for free, including from the special reserve, should remain proportional to the reduction of the surrender obligation. From 1 January 2021 onwards, the number of allowances allocated to aircraft operators should be reduced annually in line with the linear reduction factor applicable to all other sectors in the EU ETS, subject to the review in view of the implementation of the ICAO scheme. The review will be prepared in full accordance with the better regulation guidelines, with adequate consultations with all stakeholders including Member States. Allowances not allocated from the special reserve should continue to be cancelled.</p>

Once there is clarity about the nature and content of the ICAO's instruments and in advance of the start of the ICAO's global market-based measure, the Commission should present a report in which it should consider how to implement those instruments in Union law through a revision of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Commission should further consider the rules applicable to intra-EEA flights, as appropriate. In so doing, the Commission in its report should reflect the need to ensure consistency with Union law, in particular to avoid any distortion of competition and to minimise any undue administrative burden for Member States and aircraft operators.The Commission should accompany its report with a proposal, where appropriate, to the European Parliament and to the Council consistent with ensuring the contribution of aviation to the Union's 2030 economy-wide greenhouse gas reduction commitment.</p>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that the total climate impact of aviation is currently two to four times higher than the effect of its past carbon dioxide emissions alone. Pending scientific progress, all impacts of aviation should be addressed to the extent possible. In Directive 2008/101/EC a Commission proposal on nitrogen oxides was envisaged in 2008. Despite the technical and political difficulties involved, the Commission should speed up its work in that regard. Research on the formation of condensation trails, also known as contrails, on their evolution into cirrus clouds, on the smaller direct effects of sulphate aerosols and soot, and on effective mitigation measures, including operational and technical measures, should also be promoted.</p>
