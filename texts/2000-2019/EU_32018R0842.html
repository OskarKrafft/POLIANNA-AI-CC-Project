Moderation of energy demand is one of the five dimensions of that Energy Union strategy. Improving energy efficiency can deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It can also benefit the environment and health, improve energy security, cut energy costs for households and companies, help alleviate energy poverty and lead to increased jobs and economy-wide economic activity. Measures which contribute to an increased uptake of energy-saving technologies in buildings, industry and transport could be a cost-effective way of helping Member States achieve their targets under this Regulation.</p>

Activities that fall under the scope of that Regulation should not be covered by this Regulation. However, while the environmental outcome under this Regulation in terms of the levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions that are made is affected by taking into account a quantity up to the sum of total net removals and total net emissions from afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland, managed grassland and, under certain conditions, managed forest land as well as, where made mandatory under Regulation (EU) 2018/841, managed wetland, as defined in that Regulation, a LULUCF flexibility for a maximum quantity of 280 million tonnes of CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> equivalent of those removals divided among Member States should be included in this Regulation as an additional possibility for Member States to meet their commitments when needed. That total amount and its division among Member States should acknowledge the lower mitigation potential of the agriculture and land use sector and an appropriate contribution of that sector to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration. In addition, voluntary deletions of annual emission allocations under this Regulation should allow for such amounts to be taken into account when assessing Member States’ compliance with requirements under Regulation (EU) 2018/841.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">On 30 November 2016, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union (‘governance proposal’), which requires Member States to draw up integrated national energy and climate plans in the context of strategic energy and climate policy planning for all five key dimensions of the Energy Union. According to the governance proposal, the national plans covering the period from 2021 to 2030 are to play a key role in Member States’ planning of their compliance with this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2018/841. To that end, Member States are to set out the policies and measures to meet the obligations under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2018/841, with an outlook to the long-term goal to achieve a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Those plans are also to set out an assessment of the impacts of the planned policies and measures to meet the objectives. According to the governance proposal, the Commission should be able to indicate in its recommendations on the draft national plans the appropriateness of the level of ambition and of the subsequent implementation of policies and measures. The possible use of the LULUCF flexibility to comply with this Regulation should be taken into account when compiling those plans.</p>

A safety reserve of that size would cover a significant part of the projected collective deficit of eligible Member States in the period from 2021 to 2030, without additional policies, while maintaining incentives for additional action. The safety reserve should be available to those Member States in 2032, under certain conditions and provided that its use does not undermine the achievement of the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of the Union of 30 % for the year 2030 in the sectors covered by this Regulation.</p>
