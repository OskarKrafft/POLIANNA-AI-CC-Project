Extensive reconstruction works will be required in many cities, towns and villages to repair damaged infrastructure and equipment. Immediate measures are needed to alleviate the social and economic consequences of those natural disasters. In addition, people are in immediate need of basic material assistance. Moreover, support for job maintenance is needed to help employees and self-employed people to retain their jobs for a limited period of time where they are not able to access their usual place of employment due to the occurrence of a natural disaster. In order to tackle the devastating effect of natural disasters on people’s health, access to healthcare including for people who are not in imminent socio-economic vulnerability should also be possible. Evidence suggests that the occurrence of natural disasters is likely to increase in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to create a temporary framework that provides for flexibility and financial support while preserving the long-term strategic nature of cohesion policy investments.</p>

The continuity and reinforcement of planned investments in disaster prevention and preparedness, as well as climate adaptation, should be ensured, in order to mitigate the impact of the increasingly frequent natural, including climate-induced, disasters. Reconstruction efforts should not come at the expense of investment in structural long term disaster prevention and preparedness. The application of climate proofing and the ‘do no significant harm’ principle should be ensured when investing in infrastructure to enhance the resilience of Union funded infrastructure in the face of future, more frequent and severe climate-induced disasters.</p>

At the same time, support to the selected operations should remain proportionate and present the best relationship between the amount of support and the objective of ensuring disaster resilience. Furthermore, if a Member State is eligible for support from the EUSF to finance essential emergency and recovery operations restoring infrastructure to its condition prior to the occurrence of the natural disaster, the support from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund may be used in a complementary manner with the EUSF to improve the functionality of the infrastructure affected in order to enhance its capacity, sustainability and resilience to withstand future natural disasters. The purpose of the support from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund is to increase resilience and risk preparedness.</p>
