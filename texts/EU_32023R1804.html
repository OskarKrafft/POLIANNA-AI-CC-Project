The Commission Communication of 9 December 2020 entitled ‘Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future’ points to the uneven development of recharging and refuelling infrastructure across the Union and the lack of interoperability and user friendliness. It notes that the absence of a clear common methodology for setting targets and adopting measures under the national policy frameworks required by Directive 2014/94/EU has led to a situation whereby the level of ambition in target setting and supporting policies differs greatly among Member States. Those differences have hindered the establishment of a comprehensive and complete network of alternative fuels infrastructure across the Union.</p>

The use of zero-emission powertrain technologies is at different stages of maturity in the different modes of transport and in the different Member States. In particular, in the road sector, a rapid uptake of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles is taking place. Hydrogen-powered vehicles are available on the market, as well. In addition, smaller hydrogen-powered vessels and battery electric vessels and hydrogen-powered trains are currently being deployed in different projects and in first commercial operations, with full commercial roll-out expected in the coming years. In contrast, the aviation and waterborne sectors continue to be dependent on liquid and gaseous fuels, as zero- and low-emission powertrain solutions are expected to enter the market only by approximately 2030 or even later, in particular for the aviation sector, with full commercialisation taking its time. The use of fossil gaseous or liquid fuels is only possible if it is clearly embedded into a clear decarbonisation pathway that is in line with the long-term objective of climate neutrality in the Union, requiring increasing blending with or replacement by renewable fuels such as bio-methane, advanced biofuels or renewable and low-carbon synthetic, paraffinic, gaseous and liquid fuels.</p>

Those fuels are especially important for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation and maritime transport sectors, in which electrification is expected to be slower. Those fuels are technically compatible with the current vehicle technology, with minor adaptations. Moreover, renewable methanol can, among other things, be used for inland navigation and short-sea shipping. Synthetic and paraffinic fuels have the potential to reduce the use of fossil fuel sources in the transport sector. All of those fuels can be distributed, stored and used with the existing infrastructure or, where necessary, with infrastructure of the same kind.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Liquefied methane is likely to continue to play a role in maritime transport, where no economically viable zero-emission powertrain technology is currently available. However, liquefied methane from fossil sources should be phased out in maritime transport as soon as possible and substituted by more sustainable alternatives. The Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy points to zero-emission seagoing ships becoming market ready by 2030 and projects for such ships are already underway. Fleet conversion is expected to take place gradually due to the long lifetime of seagoing ships. In contrast with the situation in maritime transport, in inland waterway transport, with normally smaller vessels and shorter distances, zero-emission powertrain technologies, such as for hydrogen and electricity, are becoming mature technologies and are therefore expected to enter the market more quickly. However, those zero-emission powertrain technologies could play an important role for maritime transport in terms of creating scale regarding zero-emission propulsion solutions. Liquefied methane is expected to no longer play a significant role in that sector. Transport fuels such as liquefied methane need increasingly to be decarbonised by blending or by being substituted with, for example, liquefied biomethane or renewable and low-carbon synthetic gaseous e-fuels (e-gas). The same infrastructure can be used for those decarbonised fuels as for fossil gaseous fuels, thereby allowing for a gradual shift towards decarbonised fuels.</p>

The common scenarios underpinning the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the Commission Communication of 17 September 2020 entitled ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition - Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people’ (the ‘Climate Target Plan’) as well as the revised ‘Fit for 55’ package modelling scenarios suggest a limited role for gaseous fuels, that will increasingly be decarbonised in heavy-duty road transport and especially in the long-haul segment. Furthermore, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, for which sufficient infrastructure network already exists across the Union are expected gradually to be replaced by zero-emission powertrains and therefore only a limited targeted policy for liquefied methane infrastructure deployment that can equally supply decarbonised fuels is considered necessary to close remaining gaps in the main networks.</p>

The number of recharging points at a recharging station determines the number of vehicles that can be recharged at that station at any given time. Where more than one vehicle recharges at a recharging station at a given time, the maximum power output is distributed to the different recharging points in such a way that the power provided at each individual recharging point is lower than the power output of that recharging station. A recharging pool consists of one or more recharging stations at a specific location, including, as the case may be, the dedicated parking places adjacent to them.

The continued uneven distribution of publicly accessible recharging infrastructure would jeopardise the uptake of light-duty electric vehicles, thereby limiting connectivity across the Union. Continuing divergence in policy ambitions and approaches at national level hinders the much-needed sustainable transition of the transport sector and is not conducive to creating the long-term certainty needed for substantive market investment. Mandatory minimum targets for Member States at national level should therefore provide policy orientations and should complement national policy frameworks. That approach should combine national fleet-based targets with distance-based targets for the TEN-T. National fleet-based targets should ensure that uptake of light-duty electric vehicles in each Member State is matched by the deployment of sufficient publicly accessible recharging infrastructure. Distance-based targets for the TEN-T network should ensure full coverage of recharging points along the Union’s main road networks and thereby ensure easy and seamless travel throughout the Union.</p>

Those targets should be established on the basis of a common methodology that accounts for technological developments such as the increased driving range of electric vehicles or an increase in the number of fast recharging points, at which a greater number of electric vehicles can recharge than at a normal-power recharging point in a given period. That common methodology should also take into account the different recharging patterns of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. A methodology that sets out national fleet-based targets according to the total maximum power output of the publicly accessible recharging infrastructure would allow for flexibility in the implementation of different recharging technologies in Member States.</p>

Deployment of those publicly accessible recharging points is particularly important in residential areas where off-street parking is scarce and in areas where, typically, vehicles are parked for extended periods of time. A sufficient number of publicly accessible fast recharging points dedicated to light-duty electric vehicles should also be deployed to increase consumer convenience, in particular, across the TEN-T network to ensure full cross-border connectivity and to enable electric vehicles to circulate throughout the Union. It is important that the deployment of publicly accessible recharging infrastructure primarily be the result of private market investment. However, Member States should, subject to Union State aid rules, be able to support the deployment of the necessary publicly accessible recharging infrastructure in cases where, due to market conditions, public support is needed before a fully competitive market is established.</p>

The risk of such adverse effects could arise due to the installation of a high number of private recharging points. The needs of users or the use-rate of publicly accessible recharging stations might be lower compared to initial assumptions, with the consequence that the total power output available through publicly accessible recharging stations reaches a disproportionately high level compared to the actual use of such stations. In such cases, the Member State concerned should be able to request authorisation to apply lower requirements than the ones laid down in this Regulation in terms of level of total power output or to cease to apply such requirements. For the Member State to be able to make such a request, the share of light-duty battery electric vehicles compared to the total fleet of light-duty vehicles registered in the Member State should have reached at least 15 % and the Member State should duly justify its request.</p>

That infrastructure is necessary in particular for providing charging opportunities for delivery trucks and for destination charging for long-haul trucks. Recharging points for light-duty electric vehicles in urban areas, however, should fall within the national fleet-based target. In addition to fast recharging points along the TEN-T network and in urban nodes, heavy-duty electric vehicles should also be able to use publicly accessible recharging infrastructure for overnight recharging along the main transport network to specifically support the electrification of the long-haul sector.</p>

In addition, given the limited daily mileage of heavy-duty electric vehicles in Cyprus, their recharging needs will mostly be covered by overnight recharging capacities in private locations, such as depots. Cyprus would therefore be under a disproportionate and unnecessary obligation if it had to meet the requirements set out in this Regulation concerning minimum coverage of publicly accessible recharging pools dedicated to heavy-duty vehicles in its territory in terms of the level of total power output of such recharging pools located along the TEN-T network and the maximum distance between those recharging pools. Consequently, Cyprus should be able to submit to the Commission a reasoned request for authorisation to apply lower requirements in that respect, provided that such lower requirements would not impede the circulation of heavy-duty electric vehicles in that Member State.</p>

System integration can be further facilitated through bidirectional recharging (vehicle-to-grid), while smart and bi-directional recharging can also reduce recharging costs for the consumer. All recharging points built or renovated after 13 April 2024 should therefore support smart recharging. In addition, communication standards supporting smart and bidirectional recharging should be adopted to ensure interoperability.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Price transparency is crucial to ensuring seamless and easy recharging and refuelling. Users of alternative fuel vehicles should be provided with accurate price information before the start of the recharging or refuelling session. The price should be communicated in a clearly structured manner to allow end users to identify the different price components charged by the operator when calculating the price of a recharging or refuelling session and to anticipate the total cost. The operators of recharging stations should also be allowed to charge additional fees with a view, inter alia, to avoiding blocking the recharging point from being used by other users, as long as those fees are clearly indicated and communicated before the start of the recharging session. If the price for the recharging on an ad hoc basis is provided on a dedicated webpage, it should be clearly provided on the same webpage as the one used for the payment of the session. Laying down requirements for operators and mobility service providers would provide guarantees and predictability for consumers and thus contribute to ensuring confidence during the initial stages of uptake of electric mobility. It would also encourage the rapid uptake of battery electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered vehicles, which is essential for achieving the increased climate ambitions of the Union and the priorities set out in Commission Communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’. Prices should be reasonable and should not exceed the costs incurred plus a reasonable profit margin.

Incentives provided by Member States, as well as binding measures adopted by them, such as mandatory roaming capability on designated recharging points, have played a significant role in the development of such new services. Entities offering those new services, such as mobility service providers, should be able to operate under fair market conditions. In particular, operators of recharging points should not give unduly preferential treatment to some mobility service providers, for instance through unjustified price differentiation, that may impede competition and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers. In order to ensure the transition to new services and to ensure that users of such vehicles can easily and without hindrance use recharging infrastructure everywhere in the Union, Member States should monitor the development of the recharging market. When reviewing this Regulation, the Commission should take action where required by market developments such as limitations of services for end users, services misguiding consumers and hampering price transparency, or business practices that may limit competition.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Hydrogen-powered vehicles have at present very low market penetration rates. However, a deployment of sufficient hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is essential in order to make large-scale use of hydrogen-powered vehicles possible as envisaged in the Commission Communication of 8 July 2020 entitled ‘A hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe’. Currently, hydrogen refuelling points are only deployed in a few Member States and are largely unsuitable for heavy-duty vehicles. It is therefore not possible for hydrogen-powered vehicles to circulate throughout the Union. Mandatory deployment targets for publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling points should ensure a sufficiently dense network of hydrogen refuelling points across the TEN-T core network to allow for the seamless travel of hydrogen-powered light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles throughout the Union. For the purposes of deployment of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure along the TEN-T network, all hydrogen refuelling stations to be deployed along the TEN-T road network should be located on the TEN-T road network or within 10 km driving distance from the nearest exit of a TEN-T road.</p>

In the hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe, the heavy-duty segment was identified as the most likely segment for the early mass deployment of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Therefore, hydrogen refuelling infrastructure should focus on that segment initially, while also allowing light-duty vehicles to fuel at publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling stations. To ensure interoperability, all publicly accessible hydrogen stations should at least serve gaseous hydrogen at 700 bar. The roll out of the infrastructure should also take into account the emergence of new technologies, such as liquid hydrogen technology, that allow for a larger range for heavy-duty vehicles and are expected to be the preferred technology choice of some vehicle manufacturers.</p>

Under Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 ship operators of seagoing container ships and seagoing passenger ships are to reduce the amount of emissions produced by their ships while moored at the quayside. Mandatory deployment targets should ensure that the sector finds sufficient shore-side electricity supply for ships that are moored at the quayside in TEN-T core maritime ports and TEN-T comprehensive maritime ports to comply with those requirements. Therefore, it is important to lay down clear targets for shore-side electricity infrastructure deployment in TEN-T ports. In view of the fact that Member States have different governance models for ports, in order to reach those targets, Member States should be able to decide on the best way for them in which to deploy infrastructure within their ports and in the different terminals according to their needs. It is important that within ports, and where relevant between terminals, infrastructure be deployed where the maximum return on investment and occupancy rate result in the highest environmental benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reductions and air pollution reductions.</p>

Therefore, for all commercial transport operations, an external electricity supply should be provided while aircraft are parked at the aircraft contact stands or aircraft remote stands at airports of the TEN-T network. The external electricity supply to aircraft could be ensured by fixed or mobile ground power units, both at aircraft contact stands and aircraft remote stands. While aircraft should be able to make use of external electricity supply at all aircraft contact stands and aircraft remote stands used for commercial air transport operations, it is not necessary for each stand to be equipped with a fixed or mobile ground power unit, since a single ground power unit, whether fixed or mobile, is capable of serving multiple stands and of being deployed to meet operational needs.</p>

The lack of common technical specifications constitutes a barrier for the creation of a single market of alternative fuels infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to lay down technical specifications for areas where common technical specifications are necessary but do not yet exist. In particular, those technical specifications should cover the communication between the electric vehicle and the recharging point, the communication between the recharging point and the recharging software management system (back-end), the communication related to the electric vehicle roaming service and the communication with the electricity grid, while ensuring the highest level of cybersecurity protection and protection of final customers’ personal data. It is also necessary to establish a suitable governance framework and the roles of the different actors involved in the vehicle-to-grid communication sector. Moreover, emerging technological developments, such as electric road systems, in particular dynamic overhead power supply via a pantograph, dynamic ground level power supply through conductive rails and inductive power supply through coils in the road, have to be accounted for. As regards data provision, it is necessary for additional data types, such as the data related to the existence of facilities offering associated services to end users, the data related to the accepted payment methods, the data related to the available languages on the infrastructure and the data related to providing smart and bidirectional recharging services, to be added to the data on publicly accessible recharging.</p>

This development is likely to affect the demand for alternative fuels and consequently for alternative fuels infrastructure across all transport modes. The Commission should therefore, by 31 December 2024, present a technology and market readiness report dedicated to heavy-duty vehicles. That report should take into account the first indications of the preferences of the market and consider the technological development and the development of the technical specifications. By 31 December 2026 and every five years thereafter, the Commission should carry out a review of this Regulation.</p>
