The Renovation Wave strategy contains an action plan with concrete regulatory, financing and enabling measures, with the objective to at least double the annual energy renovation rate of buildings by 2030 and to foster deep renovations, resulting in 35 million building units renovated by 2030 and the creation of jobs in the construction sector. The revision of Directive 2010/31/EU is necessary as one of the vehicles by which to deliver on the Renovation Wave. It will also contribute to delivering on the New European Bauhaus initiative, presented in the Commission communication of 15 September 2021 entitled ‘New European Bauhaus — Beautiful, Sustainable, Together’ and the European mission on climate-neutral and smart cities. The New European Bauhaus initiative is intended to foster a more inclusive society that promotes the wellbeing of all in keeping with the historical Bauhaus, which contributed to social inclusion and the well-being of citizens, in particular worker communities. By facilitating training, networks and providing guidelines to architects, students, engineers and designers under the principles of sustainability, aesthetics and inclusion, the New European Bauhaus initiative can empower local authorities to develop innovative and cultural solutions in creating a more sustainable built environment.</p>

It contained new legislative proposals and targeted recommendations by which to increase ambition with regard to energy efficiency and savings. The communication also referred to taxation measures as means to provide incentives for energy savings and reduce fossil fuel consumption.</p>

Natural gas plays the largest role in the heating of buildings, accounting for around 39 % of energy consumption used for space heating in the residential sector. Oil is the second most important fossil fuel for heating, accounting for 11 % and coal accounts for around 3 %. Therefore, reduction of energy consumption, in line with the ‘energy efficiency first’ principle as laid down in Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc8-L_202401275EN.000101-E0008" href="#ntr8-L_202401275EN.000101-E0008"

Reduced energy consumption and an increased use of energy from renewable sources, especially solar energy, also have a key role to play in reducing the Union’s energy dependency on fossil fuels overall and on imports especially, promoting security of energy supply in line with the objectives set out in the REPowerEU plan, fostering technological developments and in creating opportunities for employment and regional development, in particular in islands, rural areas and off-grid communities.</p>

The 2050 vision for a decarbonised building stock goes beyond the current focus on operational greenhouse gas emissions. The whole-life-cycle emissions of buildings should therefore progressively be taken into account, starting with new buildings. Buildings are a significant material bank, being repositories for resources over many decades, and the design options and choices of materials largely influence the whole-life-cycle emissions both for new buildings and renovations. The whole-life-cycle performance of buildings should be taken into account not only in new construction, but also in renovations through the inclusion of policies for the reduction of whole-life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions in Member States’ national building renovation plans.</p>

However, the weighted annual energy renovation rate is persistently low at around 1 %. At the current pace, the decarbonisation of the building sector would require centuries. Triggering and supporting building renovation, including a shift towards emission-free heating systems, is therefore a key goal of this Directive. Supporting renovations at district-level, including through industrial or serial type renovations, offers benefits by stimulating the volume and depth of building renovations and will lead to a quicker and cheaper decarbonisation of the building stock. Industrial solutions for construction and building renovation include versatile prefabricated elements providing different functions such as insulation and energy generation.</p>

Some specific situations justify exemptions for individual non-residential buildings from minimum energy performance standards, in particular the planned demolition of a building or an unfavourable cost-benefit assessment; cases of serious hardship justify an exemption for as long as the hardship persists. Member States should establish stringent criteria for such exemptions in order to avoid a disproportionate share of exempted non-residential buildings.

In order to enable the cost-effective installation of solar technologies at a later stage, all new buildings should be ‘solar-ready’, that is, designed to optimise the solar generation potential on the basis of the site’s solar irradiance, enabling the installation of solar technologies without costly structural interventions. In addition, Member States should ensure the deployment of suitable solar installations on new buildings, both residential and non-residential, and on existing non-residential buildings. The large-scale deployment of solar energy on buildings would make a major contribution to shielding more effectively consumers from increasing and volatile prices of fossil fuels, reduce the exposure of vulnerable citizens to high energy costs and result in wider environmental, economic and social benefits. In order to efficiently exploit the potential of solar installations on buildings, Member States should establish criteria for the implementation of, and possible exemptions from, the deployment of solar installations on buildings, in line with the assessed technical and economic potential of the solar energy installations and the characteristics of the buildings covered by this obligation, taking into account the principle of technology neutrality and the combination of solar installations with other roof uses, such as green roofs or other building services installations. In their criteria for the practical implementation of the obligations of deployment of suitable solar energy installation on buildings, Member States should be able to express the relevant threshold in terms of the building’s ground floor area instead of the building’s useful floor area, provided that such a method corresponds to an equivalent installed capacity of suitable solar energy installation on buildings. As the obligation to deploy solar installations on individual buildings depends on the criteria established by Member States, the provisions on solar energy on buildings do not qualify as a ‘Union standard’ within the meaning of State aid rules.</p>

It is defined in Article 2, point (18), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 as meaning to take utmost account in energy planning, and in policy and investment decisions, of alternative cost-efficient energy efficiency measures to make energy demand and energy supply more efficient, in particular by means of cost-effective end-use energy savings, demand-response initiatives and more efficient conversion, transmission and distribution of energy, whilst still achieving the objectives of those decisions. The principle is therefore equally relevant with regard to improving the energy performance of buildings and is highlighted in the Renovation Wave strategy as one of the key principles for building renovation towards 2030 and 2050. As set out in Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/1749 <a id="ntc18-L_202401275EN.000101-E0018" href="#ntr18-L_202401275EN.000101-E0018"

However, such staged deep renovation needs to be carefully planned in order to avoid that one renovation step precludes necessary subsequent steps. One-step deep renovation can be more cost-effective and result in fewer emissions linked to the renovation than staged renovation. Renovation passports provide a clear roadmap for staged deep renovations, helping owners and investors plan the best timing and scope for interventions. Therefore, renovation passports should be encouraged and made available, as a voluntary tool, to building owners across all Member States. Member States should ensure that renovation passports do not create a disproportionate burden.</p>

This definition serves the purpose of increasing the energy performance of buildings. A deep renovation for energy performance purposes may also be a prime opportunity to address other aspects such as indoor environmental quality, living conditions of vulnerable households, increasing climate resilience, resilience against disaster risks including seismic resilience, fire safety, the removal of hazardous substances including asbestos, and accessibility for persons with disabilities.</p>

This potential of electric vehicles to integrate with the electricity system and contribute to system efficiency and further absorption of renewable electricity should be fully exploited. Recharging in relation to buildings is particularly important, since this is where electric vehicles park regularly and for long periods of time. Slow recharging is economical and the installation of recharging points in private spaces can provide energy storage to the related building and integration of smart recharging services and bi-directional recharging and system integration services in general.</p>

A shift to active mobility such as cycling can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport. With the increase in the sale of electrically power-assisted cycles and other L-category vehicle types, referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc21-L_202401275EN.000101-E0021" href="#ntr21-L_202401275EN.000101-E0021"

As set out in the communication of the Commission of 17 September 2020 on ‘Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition — Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people’ (the ‘Climate Target Plan’), increasing the modal shares of clean and efficient private and public transport, such as cycling, will drastically lower pollution from transport and bring major benefits to individual citizens and communities. The lack of bicycle parking spaces is a major barrier to the uptake of cycling, both in residential and non-residential buildings. Union requirements and national building codes can effectively support the transition to cleaner mobility by establishing requirements for a minimum number of bicycle parking spaces, and building bicycle parking spaces and related infrastructure in areas where bicycles are less used can lead to an increase in their use. The requirement to provide bicycle parking spaces should not depend on, or necessarily be linked to, the availability and supply of car parking spaces, which may be unavailable in certain circumstances. Member States should allow an increase in bicycle parking in residential buildings where there are no car parking spaces by providing for the installation of at least two bicycle parking spaces for every residential building unit.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Inefficient buildings are often linked to energy poverty and social problems. Vulnerable households are particularly exposed to increasing energy prices as they spend a larger proportion of their budget on energy products. By reducing excessive energy bills, building renovation can lift people out of energy poverty and can also prevent energy poverty. At the same time, building renovation does not come for free, and it is essential to ensure that the social impact of the costs for building renovation, in particular on vulnerable households, is kept in check. The Renovation Wave strategy should leave no one behind and be seized as an opportunity to improve the situation of vulnerable households, and a fair transition towards climate neutrality should be ensured. Therefore, financial incentives and other policy measures should as a priority target vulnerable households, people affected by energy poverty and people living in social housing, and Member States should take measures to prevent evictions because of renovation, such as caps on rent increases.

Together with small enterprises, they amount to 70 % of employment in the construction sector. They supply essential services and jobs locally. However, as microenterprises typically rely on fewer than 10 employees, they have limited resources to comply with regulatory requirements and rules attached to financial support programmes schemes. Energy communities, citizen-led initiatives and local authorities and energy agencies, while indispensable for delivering the Renovation Wave, face the same issues of lower administrative, financial and organisational capacities. This should not hamper the essential role of such entities and should be taken into account in the development of support and training programmes, with sufficient visibility and ease of access. Member States may actively support organisations with lower means with dedicated technical, financial and legal assistance.</p>

However, the use of different scales and formats hinders the comparability between different national schemes. Greater comparability of energy performance certificates across the Union facilitates the use of such certificates by financial institutions, thereby steering financing towards buildings with better energy performance and building renovation. The EU Taxonomy relies on the use of energy performance certificates and accentuates the need to improve their comparability. Introducing a common scale of energy performance classes and a common template should ensure sufficient comparability between energy performance certificates across the Union.</p>

Such consultations may also serve to promote the provision of adequate guidance to local planners and building inspectors to carry out the necessary tasks. Furthermore, Member States should enable and encourage architects, planners and engineers to properly consider the optimal combination of improvements in energy efficiency, use of energy from renewable sources and use of district heating and cooling when planning, designing, building and renovating industrial or residential areas, including building modelling and simulation technologies.</p>

The Commission shall also assess the national roadmaps and in particular the planned limit values for the life-cycle GWP of new buildings pursuant to Article 7(4) and shall consider whether additional measures promoting a sustainable built environment are needed. The Commission shall also examine in what manner Member States could apply integrated district or neighbourhood approaches in Union building and energy efficiency policy, while ensuring that each building meets the minimum energy performance requirements, for example by means of integrated renovation programmes and overall renovation schemes applying to a number of buildings in a spatial context instead of a single building.

               <span>The energy performance of a building shall be determined on the basis of calculated or metered energy use and shall reflect typical energy use for space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, ventilation, built-in lighting and other technical building systems. Member States shall ensure that the typical energy use is representative of actual operating conditions for each relevant typology and reflects the typical user behaviour. Where possible, typical energy use and typical user behaviour shall be based on available national statistics, building codes and metered data.</span>
               <p class="oj-normal">Where metered energy use is the basis for calculating the energy performance of buildings, the calculation methodology shall be capable of identifying the influence of the behaviour of occupants and the local climate, which shall not be reflected in the result of the calculation. Metered energy use for the purpose of calculating the energy performance of buildings shall require readings of at least monthly intervals and must differentiate between energy carriers.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">Member States may use metered energy consumption under typical operating conditions to verify the correctness of the calculated energy use and enable comparison between calculated and actual performance. Metered energy consumption for the purposes of verification and comparison may be based on monthly readings.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">The energy performance of a building shall be expressed by a numeric indicator of primary energy use per unit of reference floor area per year, in kWh/(m<span class="oj-super">2</span>.y) for the purposes of both energy performance certification and compliance with minimum energy performance requirements. The methodology applied for the determination of the energy performance of a building shall be transparent and open to innovation.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">Member States shall describe their national calculation methodology on the basis of Annex A to the key European standards on the energy performance of buildings, namely (EN) ISO 52000-1, (EN) ISO 52003-1, (EN) ISO 52010-1, (EN) ISO 52016-1, (EN) ISO 52018-1, (EN) ISO 52120-1, EN 16798-1 and EN 17423 or superseding documents. This provision shall not constitute a legal codification of those standards.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where buildings are supplied by district heating or cooling systems, the benefits of such supply are recognised and accounted for in the calculation methodology, in particular the renewable energy share, through individually certified or recognised primary energy factors.</p>

               <p class="oj-normal">Where product-specific regulations for energy-related products adopted under Directive 2009/125/EC include specific product information requirements for the purpose of calculating energy performance and life-cycle GWP under this Directive, national calculation methods shall not require additional information.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">The calculation of primary energy shall be based on regularly updated and forward-looking primary energy factors (distinguishing non-renewable, renewable and total) or weighting factors per energy carrier, which have to be recognised by the national authorities and taking into account the expected energy mix on the basis of its national energy and climate plan. Those primary energy factors or weighting factors may be based on national, regional or local information. Primary energy factors or weighting factors may be set on an annual, seasonal, monthly, daily or hourly basis or on more specific information made available for individual district systems.</p>
               <p class="oj-normal">Primary energy factors or weighting factors shall be defined by Member States. The choices made and data sources shall be reported according to EN 17423 or any superseding document. Member States may opt for an average Union primary energy factor for electricity established pursuant to Directive (EU) 2023/1791 instead of a primary energy factor reflecting the electricity mix in the country.</p>
