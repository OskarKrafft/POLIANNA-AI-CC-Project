The communication of the Commission of 20 May 2020 on an EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 – Bringing nature back into our lives (the ‘EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030’) steps up the Union’s ambition regarding the protection and restoration of biodiversity and well-functioning ecosystems. Forests and healthy soils are extremely important for biodiversity, but also for the purification of air and water, carbon sequestration and storage, and the provision of sustainably sourced long-lived wood products. The nature and function of forests is highly variable across the Union, with certain types of forests being more vulnerable to climate change due to direct impacts, such as drought, temperature-induced forest dieback or changes in aridity. Deforestation and forest degradation contribute to the global climate crisis as they increase greenhouse gas emissions, <span class="oj-italic">inter alia</span> through associated forest fires, thus permanently removing carbon sink capacities, decreasing the climate change resilience of the affected areas and substantially reducing their biodiversity.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Soil organic carbon and carbon pools of deadwood, much of which feed the soil carbon pool, are also of particularly high relevance in a number of reporting categories, for both climate action and biodiversity protection. The communication of the Commission of 16 July 2021 on a new EU Forest Strategy for 2030 (the ‘New EU Forest Strategy for 2030’) and the communication of the Commission of 17 November 2021 on the EU Soil Strategy for 2030 – Reaping the benefits of healthy soils for people, food, nature and climate (the ‘EU Soil Strategy for 2030’) both recognised the need to protect and improve the quality of forests and soil ecosystems in the Union, and to encourage reinforced sustainable management practices that can enhance carbon sequestration and strengthen the resilience of forests and soils in light of the climate and biodiversity crises. Peatlands are the largest terrestrial store of organic carbon, and improving peatland management and protection is an important aspect contributing to climate change mitigation, and to the protection of biodiversity and of the soil against erosion.</p>

It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, that transition has gender equality aspects as well as particular impacts on some disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as older people, persons with disabilities and persons with a minority racial or ethnic background.

The methodology used to establish the national targets for 2030 should take into account the gap between the Union target and the average greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, reported by each Member State in its 2020 submission, and reflect the current mitigation performance of the LULUCF sector, and each Member State’s share of the managed land area in the Union, taking into account the capacity of that Member State to improve its performance in the sector via land management practices or changes in land use that benefit the climate and biodiversity.

The forest inventory monitoring system differs from country to country, as each country has its own forest inventory system with its own methodology. The New EU Forest Strategy for 2030 stressed the need for strategic forest planning in all Member States, based on reliable monitoring and data, transparent governance and coordinated exchange at Union level. To that end, the Commission has announced that it intends to submit a legislative proposal to establish a Union-wide integrated forest monitoring framework.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The communication of the Commission of 17 September 2020 on Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition outlined different pathways and policy options to reach the Union’s increased 2030 climate target. It stressed that reaching climate neutrality will require Union action to be significantly stepped up in all sectors of the economy. Carbon sinks play an essential role in the transition to climate neutrality in the Union, and, in particular, the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors can make an important contribution in that context. Where the Commission carries out an assessment of the operation of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 as part of the review introduced by this amending Regulation, and prepares a report for the European Parliament and for the Council, it should include the current trends and future projections of emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture, on the one hand, and of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from cropland, grassland and wetlands, on the other, and explore regulatory options to ensure that they are consistent with the objective of achieving long-term greenhouse gas emission reductions in all sectors of the economy in accordance with the Union’s climate-neutrality objective and the intermediate climate targets. In addition, the Commission should pay specific attention to the effects of the forest age structure, including where those effects are linked to specific wartime or post-war circumstances, in a scientifically robust, reliable and transparent way, and with a view to ensuring the long-term resilience and adaptive capacity of forests.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Taking into account the importance of each sector making a fair contribution and the fact that the transition to climate neutrality requires changes across the entire policy spectrum and a collective effort of all sectors of the economy and society, as highlighted in the European Green Deal, the Commission should submit legislative proposals, where appropriate, setting the post-2030 framework.</p>

Currently, those emissions and removals are not included in the standard reporting tables to the UNFCCC. Subsequent to the adoption of the reporting methodology, the Commission should be able to consider reporting on the progress, feasibility of analysis and impact of extending the reporting to marine and freshwater environments based on the latest scientific evidence of those fluxes when carrying out the review introduced by this amending Regulation.</p>

Technical solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (‘BECCS’), as well as nature-based solutions for capturing and storing CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions may, where appropriate, be necessary. In particular, individual farmers, land and forest owners or forest managers need to be encouraged to store more carbon on their land and their forests, prioritising ecosystem-based approaches and biodiversity-friendly practices, such as close-to-nature forestry practices, set-aside areas, the restoration of forest carbon stocks, expansion of agroforestry coverage, soil carbon sequestration and restoration of wetlands as well as other innovative solutions. Such incentives enhance climate mitigation and overall emission reduction across sectors in the bio-economy, including through the use of durable harvested wood products, in full respect of ecological principles fostering biodiversity and the circular economy. It should be possible to consider setting up a process for inclusion of sustainable carbon storage products under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 within the review introduced by this amending Regulation, providing for consistency with other Union environmental objectives, as well as IPCC Guidelines.</p>
