As semiconductors are central to the digital economy, they are powerful enablers for the sustainability and green transition, contributing thus to the objectives of the Commission communication of 11 December 2019 on ‘The European Green Deal’. While semiconductors are essential to the functioning of today’s economy and society as well as defence and security, the Union has witnessed unprecedented disruptions in their supply, the consequences of which are significant. The current disruptions have exposed long-lasting vulnerabilities in this respect, in particular a strong third-country dependency in manufacturing and design of chips. Member States are primarily responsible for maintaining a strong industrial, competitive, sustainable base in the Union promoting innovation across a full range of chips.</p>

The second objective, separate from and complementary to the first, is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform Union legal framework for increasing the Union’s long-term resilience and its ability to innovate and provide security of supply in the field of semiconductor technologies with a view to increasing robustness in order to counter disruptions.</p>

Those measures should not entail the harmonisation of national laws and regulations. In this regard, the Union should reinforce the competitiveness and resilience of the semiconductor technological and industrial base, whilst strengthening the innovation capacity of its semiconductor ecosystem across the Union, reducing dependence on a limited number of third-country companies and geographies, and strengthening its capacity to design and produce, package, reuse and recycle advanced semiconductors. The Chips for Europe Initiative (the ‘Initiative’) established by this Regulation should support those aims by bridging the gap between the Union’s advanced research and innovation capabilities and their sustainable industrial exploitation. The Initiative should promote capacity building to enable design, production and systems integration in next-generation semiconductor technologies, and should enhance collaboration among key players across the Union, strengthening the Union’s semiconductor supply and value chains, serving key industrial sectors and creating new markets.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Due to the ubiquity of semiconductors, the recent shortages have either directly or indirectly adversely affected businesses across the Union and induced strong economic repercussions. The economic and social impact has led to an increased consciousness of the public and of economic operators and a resulting pressure for Member States to address the strategic dependencies as regards semiconductors. At the same time, the semiconductor sector is characterised by interdependencies across the value chain, where no single geography dominates all steps of the value chain. This cross-border nature is further emphasised by the nature of semiconductor products as an enabler for downstream industries. While semiconductor manufacturing may be concentrated in some regions, user industries are spread out across the Union. Against this background, the security of supply of semiconductors and resilience of the semiconductor ecosystem can be best addressed through Union harmonising law on the basis of Article 114 TFEU. A single coherent regulatory framework harmonising certain conditions for operators to carry out specific projects that contribute to the security of supply and resilience of the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem is necessary. Additionally, a coordinated mechanism for monitoring, strategic mapping, crisis prevention and response should be established to address shortages of supply and prevent obstacles to the unity of the internal market, avoiding differences in response among Member States.</p>

The current challenges of the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem call for the achievement of large-scale capacity and require a collective effort by Member States, with the Union supporting the development and deployment of large-scale capacity. That collective effort includes providing financial resources in line with the ambition of the Initiative to support the development and widespread availability of innovative capacities and extensive digital infrastructures, comprising a virtual design platform, pilot lines, including for quantum chips, and the diffusion of knowledge, skills and competences for the benefit of the entire semiconductor ecosystem. To achieve this, the Union and Member States should take into consideration the twin green and digital transition goals. In this regard, semiconductor devices and manufacturing processes offer significant opportunities for decreasing the environmental, and, in particular, the carbon impact of industries, thereby contributing to the ambitions of, for instance, the Commission communication of 14 July 2021 entitled ‘Fit for 55’: delivering the EU’s 2030 Climate Target on the way to climate neutrality’, the Recovery and Resilience Facility established by Regulation (EU) 2021/241 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2023229EN.01000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2023229EN.01000101-E0004"

The pilot lines should provide for the industry a facility to test, experiment and validate semiconductor technologies and system design concepts at the higher technology readiness levels beyond level 3 but under level 8, while reducing environmental impacts as much as possible. Investments from the Union, alongside with Member States and the private sector, in pilot lines is necessary to address the existing structural challenge and market failure where such facilities are not available in the Union hindering innovation potential and global competitiveness of the Union.</p>

The ECIC should have legal personality. This means that when applying for specific actions to be funded by the Initiative, the ECIC itself, and not individual entities forming the ECIC, can be the applicant. Nevertheless, pursuant to Article 134(3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2085, the work programme calls for proposals under the Initiative are open to different legal forms of cooperation and other participants, and the selection of proposals for funding is not based on a specific legal form of cooperation. The main aim of the ECIC should be to encourage effective and structural collaboration between legal entities, including research and technology organisations, industry and Member States. The ECIC should involve the participation of at least three members, namely Member States, or public or private legal entities from at least three Member States, or a combination thereof, with a view to achieving broad representation across the Union. By having legal personality, an ECIC would have sufficient autonomy to lay down its membership, governance, funding, budget, the arrangements for financial and in-kind contributions from its members, and coordination, management of IP and working methods. The members of the ECIC should be able to have full flexibility in determining the applicable law, statutory seat and voting rights. The selection of public and private legal entities implementing the work plan of the ECIC should be fair, transparent and open. To ensure fair and equal access to participation, an ECIC should be open to new members, namely Member States or public or private legal entities, over its lifetime. Member States in particular should be able to join an ECIC at any time either as full members or observers, whereas other public or private legal entities should be able to join at any time on fair and reasonable terms specified in the statutes of the ECIC. The Public Authorities Board of the Chips Joint Undertaking should be able to verify the openness of an ECIC and recommend for certain remedial measures to be taken where necessary. The establishment of an ECIC should not involve the actual establishment of a new Union body. It should address the gap in the Union’s toolbox to combine funding from Member States, the Union budget and private investment for the purpose of implementing specific actions supported by the Initiative. The Commission should not be a member of the ECIC.</p>

The promotion of human potential and skills through education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects up to the postdoctoral level is crucial for achieving that objective. In particular, competence centres should provide services to the semiconductor stakeholders, including start-ups and SMEs. Examples include facilitating access to pilot lines and to the virtual design platform, providing training and skills development, support to finding investors, making use of existing local competencies or reaching out to the relevant verticals. The services should be provided on an open, transparent and non-discriminatory basis. Each competence centre should connect and be part of the European network of competence centres in semiconductors and should act as an access point to other nodes of the network. In this regard, synergies with existing similar structures, such as European Digital Innovation Hubs established under the Digital Europe Programme, should be maximised. For example, Member States could designate an existing European Digital Innovation Hub focused on semiconductors as a competence centre for the purposes of this Regulation, provided that the prohibition of double financing is not breached.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Chip design is a crucial capability for implementing any innovation and functionality into electronic solutions adapted to different applications and the needs of users of semiconductors. As such, design is at the heart of the semiconductor value chain and supporting the expansion of design capabilities in the Union is of critical importance. To recognise the key role of design centres and their contribution to European excellence in advanced chip design through service offerings or strengthening of design skills and capabilities in the Union, the Commission should be able to award a label for ‘design centre of excellence’. In light of their importance for enabling a resilient semiconductor ecosystem, the design centres of excellence should be considered to be in the public interest. To contribute to the resilience of the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem, Member States should be able to apply support measures, in a proportional manner, if such design centres of excellence are SMEs. This is without prejudice to the competence of the Commission in the field of State aid under Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, where relevant, and to the Commission communication of 19 October 2022 entitled ‘Framework for State aid for research and development and innovation’ (the ‘R &amp; D&amp;I State aid framework’). The R &amp; D&amp;I State aid framework aims to facilitate research, development and innovation activities which, due to market failures, would not occur in the absence of public support. In this respect, on the basis of the R &amp; D&amp;I State aid framework, Member States, subject to certain conditions, could provide the necessary incentives to companies and the research community to carry out these important activities and investments in this field. Under the R &amp; D&amp;I State aid framework, maximum aid intensities up to the level of 80 % could be allowed for aid for R &amp; D projects of medium-sized enterprises and up to 90 % could be allowed for those of small enterprises. Furthermore, in order to maximise synergies, competence centres established under the Initiative that focus on state-of-the-art chip design should be able to apply to receive the label of ‘design centre of excellence’. At the same time, Member States could designate a design centre of excellence as their candidate competence centre.</p>

The qualifying factor for being a ‘first-of-a-kind’ facility is to bring an innovative element to the internal market regarding the manufacturing processes or the final product, which could be based on new or existing technology nodes. Relevant innovation elements could be with regard to the technology node or substrate material, or approaches that lead to improvements in computing power or other performance attributes, energy efficiency, level of security, safety or reliability, as well as integration of new functionalities, such as artificial intelligence (AI), memory capacity or other. Integration of different processes leading to efficiency gains or packaging and assembly automation are also examples of innovation. With regard to environmental gains, innovation elements include the reduction in a quantifiable way of the amount of energy, water or chemicals used, or improving recyclability. Those innovation elements could apply to both mature and cutting-edge technology nodes. Such innovation should not yet substantively be present or committed to be built within the Union. For example, similar innovation in R &amp; D or small-scale production would not necessarily exclude subsequent qualifying as a ‘first-of-a-kind’ facility. Both the installation of a new or substantially upgraded facility could lead to qualification as a ‘first-of-a-kind’ facility.</p>

Ensuring the security of supply of semiconductors is also important for digitalisation, which enables the green transition of many other sectors. To attract investments to the Union’s semiconductor sector and contribute towards security of supply of semiconductors and resilience of the Union’s semiconductor ecosystem, Member States may apply support measures, including incentives, and provide for administrative support in national permit-granting procedures for integrated production facilities and open EU foundries. This is without prejudice to the competence of the Commission in the field of State aid under Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, where relevant. To ensure the correct and efficient application of the State aid rules, in its communication of 8 February 2022 entitled ‘A Chips Act for Europe’, the Commission has already recognised the need for a case-by-case assessment regarding State aid granted to advanced semiconductor production facilities with a view to safeguarding the Union’s security of supply and supply-chain resilience while generating significant positive impacts on the wider economy. Furthermore, the procedures for the recognition as integrated production facilities or open EU foundries and for the authorisation of State aid, where applicable, will be conducted in parallel in order to accelerate the decision-making process. Member States should support the establishment of integrated production facilities and open EU foundries in accordance with Union law. When providing support measures for integrated production facilities and open EU foundries, Member States should be able to consider setting non-discriminatory requirements related to intellectual protection and security, including cyber-security, and confidentiality and could recommend mitigation measures to address specific risks related to the interference, forced technology transfers, and IP theft by entities from third countries.</p>

The Commission should limit the measures to certain critical sectors. The European Semiconductor Board may also assess and advise on appropriate and effective measures. In addition, the European Semiconductor Board may advise on the necessity of introducing protective measures pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/479 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc22-L_2023229EN.01000101-E0022" href="#ntr22-L_2023229EN.01000101-E0022"

Such information may include production capability, production capacity and current primary disruptions and bottlenecks. Those aspects could include the typical and current actual stock of crisis-relevant products in production facilities located in the Union as well as production facilities which are located in third countries where those undertakings operate, with which they contract or from which they purchase supplies; the typical and current actual average lead time for the most common products produced; the expected production output for the following three months for each Union production facility; or reasons that prevent the filling of production capacity. Such information should be limited to what is necessary to assess the nature of the semiconductor crisis or potential mitigation or emergency measures at Union or national level. Information requests should not entail the supply of information the disclosure of which is contrary to the Member States’ national security interests. The concrete information to be asked may be developed on the basis of prior advice from a representative number of relevant undertakings through voluntary consultation, in cooperation with the European Semiconductor Board. Any request should be proportionate, have regard for the legitimate aims of the undertaking and the cost and effort required to make the data available, as well as set out appropriate time limits for providing the requested information. Undertakings should be required to comply with the request and may be subject to penalties if they fail to comply or provide incorrect information. Any information acquired should be used only for the purposes of this Regulation and be subject to confidentiality rules. To ensure full involvement of the Member State where the undertaking has its production site, the Commission should forward, without delay, a copy of the information request to the national competent authority and, if the national competent authority so requests, share the acquired information with that national competent authority through secure means. If an undertaking receives a request for information related to its semiconductor activities from a third country, it should inform the Commission so as to enable the Commission to assess whether an information request by the Commission is warranted.</p>

Potential beneficiaries of priority-rated orders should be entities from critical sectors or undertakings supplying to critical sectors whose activities are disrupted or at risk of disruption on account of the shortage. To ensure that priority-rated orders are used only when necessary, they should be restricted to beneficiaries who, having implemented risk mitigation measures, were unable to avoid, for instance through their procurement practices, and to mitigate the impact of the shortage through other means, such as using existing stockpiles. That obligation may also be extended to semiconductor manufacturing facilities which have accepted such possibility in the context of receiving public support, if such public support aims to foster the ability to increase production capacity. The decision on a priority-rated order should be taken in accordance with all applicable Union legal obligations, having regard to the circumstances of the case. The priority rating obligation should take precedence over any performance obligation under private or public law while it should have regard for the legitimate aims of the undertakings and the cost and effort required for any change in production sequence. Each priority-rated order should be placed at a fair and reasonable price. The calculation of such price may be carried out on the basis of average market prices over recent years, subject to reasons being given for any increase, for example taking into account inflation or rise in energy costs. Undertakings may be subject to penalties if they fail to comply with the obligation for priority-rated orders.</p>

The mandate could authorise the Commission to enter into agreements concerning the purchase of crisis-relevant products for certain critical sectors. The Commission should assess for each request the utility, necessity and proportionality in consultation with the European Semiconductor Board. Where it intends to not follow the request, it should inform the Member States concerned and the European Semiconductor Board and give its reasons. The procedural details should be set out in an agreement between the Commission and the participating Member States, including reasons for the use of the common purchasing mechanism and liabilities to be assumed. Such an agreement may include the number of contracts to be concluded and the conditions of the common purchasing, such as prices, delivery timeframes, quantities and opt-in or opt-out clauses. The common purchasing may result in the signature of one contract covering the needs of all Member States or several contracts each covering the needs of one or more Member States. Furthermore, the participating Member States should be entitled to appoint representatives to provide guidance and advice during the procurement procedures and in the negotiation of the purchasing agreements. The deployment, use or resale of purchased products should remain within the remit of the participating Member States.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">The initial and, where appropriate, subsequent actions supported by the Initiative shall be implemented in accordance with the following technical description:</p>
            <p id="d1e45-47-1" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">Part I</p>
            <p id="L_2023229EN.01004701-g-001-0001" class="oj-ti-grseq-1">Design capacities for integrated semiconductor technologies</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The Initiative shall build up large-scale innovative design capacities for integrated semiconductor technologies through a virtual design platform available across the Union. The virtual design platform will consist of new innovative design facilities with extended libraries and tools, integrating a large number of existing and new technologies (including emerging technologies such as integrated photonics, quantum and AI/neuromorphic). In combination with existing EDA tools, it will allow the design of innovative components and new system concepts and demonstrate key functionalities such as new approaches to high performance, low energy, security, new 3D and heterogeneous system architectures, etc.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Working closely with the user industries from a variety of economic sectors, the virtual design platform will connect the communities of design houses, IP and tool suppliers with research and technology organisations (RTOs) to provide virtual prototype solutions on the basis of co-development of technology. Risks and development costs will be shared and new web-based methods of accessing design tools, with flexible cost models, especially for prototyping, and common interface standards will be promoted.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The virtual design platform shall be continuously upgraded with new design capabilities as it continuously integrates more and more technologies and designs for low-power processors (including open-source, such as RISC-V). Furthermore, the virtual design platform may enable the design of other technologies, such as programmable chips based on field programmable gate arrays, new 3D and heterogeneous system architectures, etc. It will offer its services via the cloud, maximising access and openness to the whole community by networking existing and new design centres across the Member States.</p>

                        <p class="oj-normal">The pilot lines will include a dedicated design infrastructure consisting for example of design models simulating the fabrication process for the design tools used to design circuits and systems-on-chip. This design infrastructure and a user-friendly virtualisation of the pilot lines will be established that will make them directly accessible throughout the Union via the virtual design platform. Such a link will enable the design community to test and validate technology options before these become commercially available. It will ensure that new chip and system design fully exploit the potential of new technologies and deliver cutting edge innovation.</p>
                        <p class="oj-normal">Together, these pilot lines will advance the Union’s IP, skills and innovation in semiconductor manufacturing technology and will reinforce and expand the Union’s position in new manufacturing equipment and materials for advanced semiconductor technology modules, such as e.g. lithography and wafer technologies.</p>
                        <p class="oj-normal">Close concertation and collaboration with industry shall be organised to guide this capacity expansion and the critical inclusion from the start of selected qualified pilot lines involving for example advanced packaging, 3D heterogeneous integration technology and important additional functionalities such as silicon photonics, power electronics, sensing technologies, silicon graphene and quantum technologies. This powerful extended Union-wide pilot line infrastructure, intimately connected with the design enablement infrastructure, is fundamental for expanding the Union’s knowledge, capacity and capabilities to close the innovation gap from publicly funded research to commercially funded manufacturing, and to increase both demand and manufacturing in the Union by the end of the decade.</p>
