Member States have already introduced or are considering the introduction of rules promoting repair and reuse of goods purchased by consumers outside the existing liability of the seller established by Directive (EU) 2019/771. Differing mandatory national rules in this area constitute actual or potential obstacles to the functioning of the internal market, adversely affecting cross-border transactions of economic operators acting on that market. Those operators could have to adapt their services to comply with the different mandatory national rules and be faced with additional transaction costs for obtaining the necessary legal advice on the requirements of the law of the Member State of the consumer’s habitual residence, which apply pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc5-L_202401799EN.000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_202401799EN.000101-E0005"

Repair should result in sustainable consumption, since it is likely to generate less waste caused by discarded goods, less demand for resources, including energy, caused by the process of manufacturing and sale of new goods replacing defective goods, as well as less greenhouse gas emissions. This Directive promotes sustainable consumption with a view to achieving benefits for the environment, by promoting a life cycle of goods which includes re-use, repair and refurbishment, while also producing benefits for consumers by avoiding costs associated with new purchases in the short term.</p>

In order to facilitate the consumer’s free choice to decide by whom to have goods repaired and to help identify and choose suitable repair services, repairers should be able to use on a voluntary basis the standardised European Repair Information Form provided in Annex I to this Directive. The European Repair Information Form should comprise the key parameters that influence consumer repair decisions, such as the nature of the defect, the price and the time within which the repairer undertakes to complete the repair. If the repairer offers additional services such as transportation, the individual costs of those services should be indicated. Information in the European Repair Information Form should be provided to consumers in a clear and comprehensible manner and in line with the accessibility requirements of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc9-L_202401799EN.000101-E0009" href="#ntr9-L_202401799EN.000101-E0009"

In line with the pre-contractual information and other requirements set out in Directive 2011/83/EU, the repairer should inform the consumer about such costs before the consumer requests the diagnostic service and before the provision of the European Repair Information Form. Consumers should be able to refrain from requesting the diagnostic service where they consider that the costs for obtaining the diagnostic service are too high. If the consumer chooses to have the good repaired, the repairer should be able to deduct such costs from the price of the repair.

Where that obligation does not apply, a large number of defective, but otherwise viable, goods are prematurely discarded. In order to encourage consumers to have goods repaired in such situations, this Directive should impose an obligation on manufacturers to repair upon the consumer’s request goods to which repairability requirements imposed by Union legal acts apply, since they are the addressees of those repairability requirements. That obligation should apply to manufacturers established both inside and outside the Union in relation to goods placed on the Union market. Furthermore, this Directive should not put into question the economic freedom of choice for manufacturers to stop manufacturing a good, without prejudice, where applicable, to the obligation to provide spare parts and tools under Union law.</p>

The charging of a price should encourage manufacturers to develop sustainable business models, including the provision of repair services. Such a price might take into account, for instance, labour costs, costs for spare parts, costs for operating the repair facility and a customary margin. The price should be reasonable, meaning it should be set in such a way that consumers are not intentionally deterred from benefitting from the manufacturers’ obligation to repair. The price for and the conditions of repair should be agreed in a contract between the consumer and the manufacturer and the consumer should remain free to decide whether that price and those conditions are acceptable. The need for such a contract and the competitive pressure from other repairers should encourage manufacturers who are obliged to repair to keep the price acceptable for the consumer. The repair obligation might also be performed for free where the defect is covered by a commercial guarantee, for instance, in relation to guaranteed durability of goods. To incentivise consumers to have their goods repaired outside of the legal guarantee, a manufacturer should be able to offer a loan of a comparable good for the duration of the repair, which is expected to be returned once the consumer receives the repaired good.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To avoid overburdening manufacturers and to ensure they are able to perform their obligation to repair, that obligation should be limited to those goods for which and to the extent any repairability requirements are provided for in Union legal acts. Repairability requirements do not oblige manufacturers to repair defective goods, but ensure that goods are repairable. Examples of Union legal acts laying down repairability requirements are delegated acts adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 or implementing measures adopted pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC, which create a framework to improve the environmental sustainability of products, or other relevant Union legal acts such as Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc16-L_202401799EN.000101-E0016" href="#ntr16-L_202401799EN.000101-E0016"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">16</span>)</a>. This limitation of the obligation to repair should ensure that only those goods which are repairable by design are subject to such obligation. Relevant repairability requirements include design requirements enhancing the ability to disassemble the goods and a range of spare parts to be made available for a minimum period. The obligation to repair should correspond to the scope of the repairability requirements, for instance, ecodesign requirements might apply only to certain components of the goods or a specific period of time might be set to make spare parts available. The obligation to repair under this Directive, which allows the consumer to claim repair directly against the manufacturer in the after-sales phase, should complement the supply-side related repairability requirements laid down in for example Regulation (EU) 2024/1781, encouraging consumer demand for repair.</p>

In order to ensure coherence with future regulatory developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding Union legal acts to Annex II to this Directive, when new repairability requirements are adopted. The Commission should add those legal acts as quickly as possible and at the latest 12 months after their publication. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making <a id="ntc17-L_202401799EN.000101-E0017" href="#ntr17-L_202401799EN.000101-E0017"

This choice will be facilitated by the European Repair Information Form provided voluntarily by not only the manufacturer but also by repairers like the seller or independent repairers or by searching via an online repair platform. As consumers would need to pay for the repair, they are likely to compare repair opportunities in order to choose the most suitable repair services for their needs. Thus, it is likely they approach independent repairers in their proximity or the seller before reaching out to manufacturers which might for instance be located at a greater distance and for which the price could be higher due to transportation costs.</p>

The European online platform should consist of national sections based on a common online interface and include links to national online platforms for repair (the ‘national online platforms’) that fulfil the criteria set out in this Directive. To this end, the Commission should develop a common online interface for the European online platform. The Commission should also be responsible for ensuring the IT maintenance of the common online interface and respond to technical or other queries from users regarding any incorrect functioning of the European online platform. The European online platform should be accessible for free for consumers. It should also be able to accommodate, where applicable, sellers of refurbished goods, purchasers of defective goods for refurbishment or complementary market-based instruments, such as community-led repair initiatives. Member States should either use the common online interface for creating their national sections on the European online platform or establish, or maintain where applicable, national online platforms that fulfil the criteria set out in this Directive. When Member States use the European online platform, it should be left to Member States’ discretion how to populate the national sections, for instance by self-registration, importing bulk data from existing databases with the consent of the repairers or by making registration subject to prior approval. Where Member States consider it necessary, they should be able to set out conditions for accessing the national sections, such as meeting criteria on professional qualifications or showing adherence to applicable voluntary European or national repair quality standards. Such conditions should be non-discriminatory and in accordance with Union law. Member States that choose to set access conditions in their national sections should benefit from six additional months to make their national section operational.</p>

That extension should apply once. However, Member States could further incentivise repair by providing for additional extensions of the liability of the seller if repair takes place again. Member States could also introduce or maintain rules to extend the liability of the seller in case of repair for periods longer than 12 months. In line with Directive (EU) 2019/771, where the extension of the liability period applies, the seller should be liable for any lack of conformity which existed at the time when the goods were delivered and which becomes apparent within the remaining liability period of the good, which includes the extension. The extension of the liability period should be without prejudice to consumers rights provided in Directive (EU) 2019/771. This Directive should be without prejudice to Member States introducing or maintaining provisions which provide for a longer extension of the liability period only for repaired parts in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/771. Taking into account the flexibility provided by Directive (EU) 2019/771, Member States which do not provide for fixed time limits for the liability of the seller or only provide a limitation period for the remedies should ensure that the liability of the seller or the limitation period for remedies in the event of repair is at least equivalent to two years and 12 months, corresponding to the minimum period of liability of the seller set out in Directive (EU) 2019/771 and the minimum extension of that period in the event of repair.

The objective of this Directive can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level through fully harmonised common rules promoting repair within and outside the liability of the seller established in Directive (EU) 2019/771. The Union may therefore adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.</p>

It contributes to an improvement of the quality of the environment in accordance with Article 37 of the Charter by promoting sustainable consumption of goods and thereby reducing negative environmental impacts from premature disposal of viable goods. This Directive ensures full respect of Article 38 on consumer protection by enhancing consumer rights relating to defects that occur or become apparent outside the liability of the seller pursuant to Directive (EU) 2019/771. It also ensures respect for the freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Article 16 of the Charter by safeguarding contractual freedom and encouraging the development of repair services in the internal market. This Directive contributes to the integration of persons with disabilities in accordance with Article 26 of the Charter by facilitating accessibility of the European online platform for persons with disabilities. This Directive seeks to ensure full respect of Article 47 of the Charter on the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial through effective means of enforcement,</p>
