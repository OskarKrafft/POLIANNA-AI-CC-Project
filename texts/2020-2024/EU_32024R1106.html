Due to the increasingly close interrelation between financial markets and wholesale energy markets, Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 should be better aligned with the financial market legislation of the Union, such as Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_202401106EN.000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_202401106EN.000101-E0004"

The definition of market manipulation in Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 should therefore be amended to align it with Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. To that end, the definition of market manipulation under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 should be amended to capture the entering into any transaction, or issuing, modifying or withdrawing any order to trade, but also any other behaviour relating to wholesale energy products which gives, or is likely to give, false or misleading signals as to the supply of, demand for, or price of wholesale energy products; secures, or is likely to secure, by a person, or persons acting in collaboration, the price of one or more wholesale energy products at an artificial level; or employs a fictitious device or any other form of deception or contrivance which gives, or is likely to give, false or misleading signals regarding the supply of, demand for, or price of wholesale energy products. In that regard, with a view to the alignment with Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, the notion of any other behaviour relating to wholesale energy products should include, but should not be limited to, actions such as quote stuffing, painting the tape or momentum ignition.</p>

In particular, where inside information concerns a process which occurs in stages, each stage of the process as well as the overall process could constitute inside information. An intermediate step in a protracted process could in itself constitute a set of particular circumstances or a particular event which exists or where there is a realistic prospect that they will come into existence or occur, on the basis of an overall assessment of the factors existing at the relevant time. However, that should not be interpreted as meaning that the magnitude of the effect of that set of circumstances or that event on the prices of the wholesale energy products concerned is to be taken into consideration. An intermediate step in a protracted process should be considered to be inside information if it, by itself, meets the criteria laid down in this Regulation for inside information.</p>

The Agency’s LNG price assessment should comprise the most complete dataset including transaction prices, bids and offer prices for LNG deliveries to the Union. The daily publication of that objective LNG price assessment, and of the spread established in comparison to other reference prices on the market in the form of an LNG benchmark, paves the way for its voluntary uptake by market participants as the reference price in their contracts and transactions. Once established, the LNG price assessment and the LNG benchmark could also become a reference rate for derivative contracts used for hedging the price of LNG or the difference in price between the LNG price and other gas prices.</p>

In order to ensure the consistent application of administrative fines across the Member States for breaches of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011, that Regulation should be amended to provide for a list of administrative fines and other administrative measures which should be available to the national regulatory authorities as well as for a list of criteria to determine the level of those administrative fines. In particular, the amount of administrative fines which can be imposed in a specific case should be able to reach the maximum level provided for in this Regulation. However, this Regulation does not limit Member States’ ability to provide for lower administrative fines on a case-by-case basis. Penalties for breaches of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 should be proportionate, effective and dissuasive and should reflect the type of the breaches, taking into account the ne bis in idem principle. The adoption and publication of administrative fines should respect fundamental rights as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). Administrative fines and other administrative measures are complementary parts of an effective enforcement regime. A harmonised supervision of the wholesale energy markets requires a consistent approach among national regulatory authorities. In order to fulfil their tasks, it is necessary that the national regulatory authorities be provided with the appropriate resources.</p>

The absence of a mechanism to ensure the best possible supervisory decisions for cross-border cases, where joint action by national regulatory authorities and the Agency currently requires complicated arrangements and where there is a patchwork of supervisory regimes must be addressed. There is a need to set up an efficient and effective supervisory and investigatory regime for those cases of market abuse which cannot, due to their Union wide features, be addressed by Member State action alone.</p>

Moreover, such investigations can be better conducted at Union level, as their impact expands beyond the territory of a single Member State. The complexity of cross-border cases and the need to ensure sufficient resources for such cases requires the involvement of the Agency, in particular in a more integrated wholesale energy market. Since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011, the Agency has gained significant experience in monitoring and collecting relevant data on the wholesale energy markets in the Union to ensure their integrity and transparency. Building on that experience, the Agency should be empowered to carry out investigations to combat breaches of Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011, including by appointing an independent investigating officer within the Agency. The Agency should carry out such investigations in cooperation with the national regulatory authorities and other relevant authorities with the purpose of supporting and complementing their enforcement activities and taking into account the ne bis in idem principle. Moreover, in the context of an investigation conducted by the Agency, where necessary, relevant national regulatory authorities should cooperate amongst each other in assisting the Agency. In exercising its powers, the Agency should be able to give priority, if needed, to the cases with the most significant cross-border impact.</p>

However, for technical reasons, there are cases where it is not possible to identify the geographic location of delivery of wholesale energy products. For instance, when delivery of wholesale energy products takes place or is assumed to take place in a bidding zone which encompasses the territory, or part of the territory, of at least two Member States in the intra-day and day-ahead wholesale electricity markets, it is not possible to identify the precise place of that delivery within that zone. The same applies to delivery of wholesale energy products that takes place or is assumed to take place in gas balancing zones which encompass the territory, or part of the territory, of at least two Member States. To ensure that the Agency acts in genuine cross-border cases as opposed to cases that have only a national dimension, the delivery of wholesale energy products within a bidding or balancing zone that encompasses the territory of at least two Member States should be considered to be delivery in a single Member State. However, the national regulatory authorities concerned should maintain their right also to request the Agency’s involvement in cases with a cross-border dimension pursuant to this Regulation, as well as their right to object pursuant to this Regulation.</p>

When establishing such thresholds, the Commission should consider ensuring coherence with other relevant Union law in the fields of financial services and energy.
