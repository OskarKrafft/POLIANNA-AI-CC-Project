Measures adopted at Union level which do not take into account international coordination and cooperation would have very limited effect. The measures adopted by the Union in that field should therefore be compatible with, and at least as stringent as, other actions undertaken at international level. Union action should continue to take particular account of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations and instruments of other international bodies active in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. With a view to reinforcing the efficacy of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the relevant Union legal acts should, where appropriate, be aligned with the International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation adopted by the FATF in February 2012 (the ‘revised FATF Recommendations’) and the subsequent amendments to those standards.</p>

As such, it is appropriate to allow Member States, upon identification of such sectors and specific risks, to decide to apply AML/CFT requirements to additional sectors than those covered by Regulation (EU) 2024/1624. With a view to preserving the effectiveness of the internal market and the Union AML/CFT system, the Commission should be able, with the support of AMLA, to assess whether the intended application by Member States of AML/CFT requirements to additional sectors is justified. In cases where the best interests of the Union would be achieved by taking action at Union level as regards specific sectors, the Commission should inform the Member State intending to apply the AML/CFT requirements to those sectors that it intends to take action at Union level instead and the Member State should abstain from taking the intended national measures, unless those measures are intended to address an urgent risk.</p>

Regardless of the framework that applies to the exercise of the profession or activity, all obliged entities act as gatekeepers of the Union’s financial system and must develop specific AML/CFT skills to fulfil that task. Member States should consider providing training to persons wishing to enter the profession of those entities to enable them to perform their duties.

For example, weaknesses in the operation of certain schemes, including the absence of risk management processes or weak implementation of those processes can create opportunities for corruption, whereas weak or inconsistently applied checks on applicants’ source of funds and source of wealth might lead to higher risks that such schemes are exploited by applicants for criminal purposes, aiming to legitimise funds obtained through illicit means. In order to avoid that risks stemming from the operation of such schemes affect the Union’s financial system, Member States whose national law enables the granting of residence rights in exchange for any kind of investment should therefore put in place measures to mitigate the associated risks of money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing. Such measures should include an adequate risk management process, including the effective monitoring of its implementation, checks on the profile of the applicants, including obtaining information on their source of funds and source of wealth, and the verification of information on applicants against information held by competent authorities.</p>

It should therefore be entrusted with the responsibility for coordinating the assessment of risks relating to cross-border activities. Involvement of the relevant experts, such as the Expert Group on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and the representatives from the Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), as well as, where appropriate, from other Union-level bodies including AMLA, is essential for the effectiveness of the process of the assessment of risks. National risk assessments and experience are also an important source of information for that process. Such assessment of the cross-border risks by the Commission should not involve the processing of personal data. In any event, data should be fully anonymised. Union and national data protection supervisory authorities should be involved only if the assessment of the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing has an impact on the privacy and data protection of individuals. To maximise synergies between the assessment of risks at Union and national level, the Commission and Member States should endeavour to apply consistent methodologies.</p>

Such national risk assessment should include a description of the institutional structure and procedures of the Member State’s AML/CFT regime, as well as the allocated human and financial resources to the extent that this information is available. In order to maintain an ongoing understanding of risks, Member States should regularly update their national risk assessment, and should also be able to supplement it with targeted updates and assessments of risks associated with specific sectors, products or services.</p>

In the case of legal arrangements, given the settlor’s right as to the choice of the law that governs the arrangement, it is also important that Member States have an understanding of the risks associated with the legal arrangements that can be set up under their law, irrespective of whether their laws explicitly regulate them, or their creation finds its source in the freedom of contract of the parties and is recognised by national courts.</p>

It is thus important that the Union and its Member States have an understanding of the exposure to risks emanating from foreign legal entities and foreign legal arrangements. Such assessment of risks does not need to address each individual foreign legal entity or foreign legal arrangement that has a sufficient link with the Union, whether by virtue of it acquiring real estate or being awarded contracts following a public procurement procedure, or because of transactions with obliged entities that allow them to access the Union’s financial system and economy. The risk assessment should however enable the Union and its Member States to understand what type of foreign legal entities and foreign legal arrangements enjoy such an access to the Union’s financial system and economy, and what types of risks are associated with that access.</p>

It is therefore necessary to devise a framework for the recognition and verification of legitimate interest at Union level, in full respect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). Where a legitimate interest exists, the public should be able to access information on beneficial ownership of legal entities and legal arrangements. Legitimate interest should be presumed for certain categories of the public.

They should therefore be considered to have a legitimate interest in accessing beneficial ownership information, which is of vital importance for them to undertake their functions and exert public scrutiny, as appropriate. The ability to access the central registers should not be conditional on the medium or platform through which they carry out their activities, or on previous experience in the field. In order to enable such categories to carry out their activities effectively and avoid risks of retaliation, they should be able to access information on legal entities and legal arrangements without demonstrating a link with those entities or arrangements. As provided for under Union data protection rules, any access by beneficial owners to information on the processing made of their personal data should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, including the right to security of the person. Disclosure to the beneficial owner that persons acting for the purposes of journalism or civil society organisations have consulted their personal data risks undermining the safety of journalists and of members of civil society organisations who carry out investigations into potential criminal activities. Therefore, in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of information and expression for journalists in accordance with Article 85 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc15-L_202401640EN.000101-E0015" href="#ntr15-L_202401640EN.000101-E0015"

                           <p class="oj-normal">The integrity of business transactions is critical to the proper functioning of the internal market and of the Union’s financial system. To that end, it is important that persons who wish to do business with legal entities or legal arrangements in the Union are able to access information on the beneficial owners of those entities or arrangements to verify that their potential business counterparts are not involved in money laundering, its predicate offences or terrorist financing. There is widespread evidence that criminals hide their identity behind corporate structures, and enabling those who could enter into transactions with a legal entity or legal arrangement to become aware of the identity of the beneficial owners contributes to combating the misuse of legal entities or legal arrangements for criminal purposes. A transaction is not limited to trading activities or the provision or buying of products or services, but might also include, situations where a person is likely to invest funds as defined in Article 4, point (25), of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc16-L_202401640EN.000101-E0016" href="#ntr16-L_202401640EN.000101-E0016"

                           <p class="oj-normal">Given the cross-border nature of money laundering, its predicate offence and terrorist financing, it should be recognised that authorities of third countries have a legitimate interest in accessing beneficial ownership information on Union’s legal entities and legal arrangements, where such access is needed by those authorities in the context of specific investigations or analyses to perform their tasks with respect to AML/CFT. Similarly, entities that are subject to AML/CFT requirements in third countries should be able to access the beneficial ownership information in the Union central registers when they are required to take customer due diligence measures in compliance with AML/CFT requirements in those countries in relation to legal entities and legal arrangements established in the Union. Any access to information contained in the central registers should be compliant with Union law on the protection of personal data, and in particular with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. To that end, central registers should also consider whether requests from persons established outside the Union can fall within the conditions within which a derogation under Article 49 of that Regulation can be availed of. It is settled case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ‘Court of Justice’) that the fight against money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing is an objective of general public interest, and that public security objectives are connected to it. In order to preserve the integrity of investigations and analyses by third-country FIUs and law enforcement and judicial authorities, central registers should refrain from disclosing to the beneficial owners any processing of their personal data by those authorities insofar as such disclosure would adversely affect the investigations and analyses of those authorities. However, in order to preserve the data subject rights, the central registers should only refrain from disclosing that information until such disclosure would no longer jeopardise an investigation or analysis. That deadline should be set to a maximum period of 5 years, and should be extended only upon a justified request by the authority in the third country.</p>

Timely access to information held in the central register is crucial to ensuring that public authorities carrying out public procurement procedures can fulfil their functions effectively, including by detecting instances of corruption in those procedures. The notion of public authorities in relation to procurement procedures should encompass the concept of contracting authorities in Union legal acts relating to public procurement procedures for goods and services, or concessions as well as any public authority designated by Member States to verify the legality of public procurement procedures, which is not a competent authority for AML/CFT purposes.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Products such as customer screening offered by third-party providers support obliged entities in the performance of customer due diligence. Such products provide them with a holistic view over the customer, which enables them to make informed decisions as to their risk classification, mitigating measures to be applied and possible suspicions regarding the customers’ activities. Those products also contribute to the work of competent authorities in the analysis of suspicious transactions and investigations into potential cases of money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing by complementing information on beneficial ownership with other technical solutions that enable competent authorities to have a broader view of complex criminal schemes, including through the localisation of perpetrators. They therefore play a critical role in tracing the increasingly complex and fast movements that characterise money laundering schemes. By virtue of their well-established function in the compliance infrastructure, it is justified to consider that providers offering those products hold a legitimate interest in accessing information held in the central registers, provided that the data obtained from the register are offered only to obliged entities and competent authorities in the Union for the performance of tasks related to preventing and fighting money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Real estate is an attractive commodity for criminals to launder the proceeds of their illicit activities, as it allows the true source of the funds and the identity of the beneficial owner to be obscured. The proper and timely identification of real estate, as well as of natural persons, legal entities and legal arrangements owning real estate by FIUs and other competent authorities is important both for detecting money laundering schemes as well as for freezing and confiscation of assets, as well as for administrative freezing measures implementing targeted financial sanctions. It is therefore important that Member States provide FIUs and other competent authorities with immediate and direct access to information which allows the proper conduct of analyses and investigations into potential criminal cases involving real estate. In order to facilitate effective access, that information should be provided free of charge through a single access point, by digital means and where possible in machine-readable format. The information should include historical information, including the history of real estate ownership, the prices at which the real estate has been acquired in the past and related encumbrances over a defined period in the past in order to enable FIUs and other competent authorities in that Member State to analyse and identify any suspicious activities pertaining to real estate, including land, property transactions which could be indicative of money laundering or other types of criminality. Such historical information concerns types of information already collected when carrying out real estate property transactions. Therefore, there are no new obligations imposed upon affected persons, ensuring that the legitimate expectations of those concerned are duly respected. Given the frequently cross-border nature of criminal schemes involving real estate, it is appropriate to identify a minimum set of information that competent authorities should be able to access and share with their counterparts in other Member States.</p>

The FIU should be the single central national unit responsible for the receipt and analysis of suspicious transaction reports, reports on cross-border physical movements of cash through the Customs Information System, on transactions reported when certain thresholds are exceeded (threshold-based disclosures) as well as other information relevant to money laundering, its predicate offences or terrorist financing submitted by obliged entities. Operational independence and autonomy of the FIU should be ensured by granting the FIU the authority and capacity to carry out its functions freely, including the ability to take autonomous decisions as regards analysis, requests and dissemination of specific information. In all cases, the FIU should have the independent right to forward or disseminate information to relevant competent authorities. The FIU should be provided with adequate financial, human and technical resources, in a manner that secures its autonomy and independence and enables it to exercise its mandate effectively. The FIU should be able to obtain and deploy the resources needed to carry out its functions, on an individual or routine basis, free from any undue political, government or industry influence or interference, which might compromise its operational independence. In order to assess the fulfilment of those requirements and identify weaknesses and best practices, AMLA should be empowered to coordinate the organisation of peer reviews of FIUs.</p>

Given the nature of their work, FIUs are recipients of, and have access to, large amounts of sensitive personal and financial information. Therefore, the staff of FIUs should have appropriate skills when it comes to the ethical use of big data analytical tools. Moreover, the activities of FIUs might have implications for individuals’ fundamental rights, such as the right to the protection of personal data, right to private life and right to property. FIUs should therefore designate a Fundamental Rights Officer who can be a member of the existing staff of the FIU. The tasks of the Fundamental Rights Officer should include, without impeding or delaying the activities of the FIU, monitoring and promoting the FIU’s compliance with fundamental rights, providing advice and guidance to the FIU on fundamental rights implications of its policies and practices, scrutinising the lawfulness and ethics of the FIU’s activities and issuing non-binding opinions. The designation of a Fundamental Rights Officer would help to ensure that in carrying out their tasks, FIUs respect and protect fundamental rights of affected individuals.</p>

Across Member States, other authorities have dedicated roles connected to the fight against money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing, and FIUs should also be able to provide them with the results of their operational or strategic analyses, where they consider those results to be relevant to their functions. The results of those analyses provide meaningful intelligence to be used for the development of leads in the course of investigative and prosecutorial work. The source of the suspicious transaction or activity report should not be disclosed in the dissemination. This, however, should not preclude FIUs from disseminating relevant information including, for example, information on IBAN numbers, BIC or SWIFT codes. In addition, FIUs should be able to share other information in their possession including upon request by other competent authorities. In exercising their autonomy and independence, FIUs should consider how a refusal to provide information could impact cooperation and the broader goal of combatting money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing. Refusals should be limited to exceptional circumstances, for example when the information originates from another FIU that has not consented to its further dissemination, or where the FIU has reasons to believe that the information will not be used for the purposes for which it was requested. In such cases the FIU should provide reasons for the refusal. Such reasons could include clarifying that the information is not in the possession of the FIU or that consent for further dissemination has not been granted.</p>

It ensures a comprehensive and consistent approach to preventing and combating money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing, enhances the effectiveness of the Union AML/CFT regime and safeguards the economy from the threats posed by illicit financial activities. Information in the possession of FIUs pertaining to, for example, the quality and quantity of suspicious transaction reports submitted by obliged entities, the quality and timeliness of obliged entities’ responses to requests for information by the FIUs, and information on money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing typologies, trends and methods can help supervisors identify areas where risks are higher or where compliance is weak and thereby provide them with an insight into whether supervision needs to be strengthened in relation to specific obliged entities or sectors. To that end, FIUs should provide supervisors, either spontaneously or upon request, with certain types of information that could be relevant for the purposes of supervision.</p>

Financial intelligence might be of fundamental importance in uncovering the facilitation of terrorist offences and the networks and schemes of terrorist organisations. FIUs maintain significant differences as regards their functions, competences and powers. The current differences should however not affect an FIU’s activity, particularly its capacity to develop preventive analyses in support of all the authorities in charge of intelligence, investigative and judicial activities, and international cooperation. In the exercise of their tasks, it has become essential to identify the minimum set of data FIUs should have swift access to and be able to exchange without impediments with their counterparts from other Member States. In all cases of suspected money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing, information should flow directly and quickly between FIUs without undue delay. It is therefore essential to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of FIUs, by clarifying the powers of and cooperation between FIUs.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The powers of FIUs include the right to access, directly or indirectly, the ‘financial’, ‘administrative’ and ‘law enforcement’ information that they require in order to combat money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing. The lack of definition of what types of information those general categories include has resulted in FIUs having been granted with access to considerably diversified sets of information which has an impact on FIUs’ analytical functions as well as on their capacity to cooperate effectively with their counterparts from other Member States, including in the framework of joint analysis exercises. It is therefore necessary to define the minimum sets of ‘financial’, ‘administrative’ and ‘law enforcement’ information that should be made directly or indirectly available to every FIU across the Union. FIUs also receive and store in their databases, or have access to, information related to transactions that are reported when specified thresholds are exceeded (threshold-based reports). Those reports are an important source of information and are widely used by FIUs in the context of domestic and joint analyses. Therefore, threshold-based reports are among the types of information exchanged through FIU.net. Direct access is an important prerequisite for the operational effectiveness and responsiveness of FIUs. To that end, it should be possible for Member States to provide FIUs with direct access to a broader set of information than those required by this Directive. At the same time, this Directive does not require Member States to set up new databases or registers in the cases where certain types of information, for example, information on procurement, is spread across various repositories or archives. Where a database or register has not been set up, Member States should take other necessary measures to ensure that FIUs can obtain that information in an expeditious manner. Moreover, FIUs should be able to obtain swiftly from any obliged entity all necessary information relating to their functions. An FIU should also be able to obtain such information upon request made by another FIU and to exchange that information with the requesting FIU.</p>

The information should not undergo any filtering. In some situations, however, the confidentiality requirements attached to the information might not allow the provision of the information in an unfiltered manner.

However, there are certain variations in relation to the duration of the suspension powers across Member States, with an impact not only on the postponement of activities that have a cross-border nature through FIU-to-FIU cooperation, but also on individuals’ fundamental rights. Furthermore, in order to ensure that FIUs have the capacity to promptly restrain criminal funds or assets and prevent their dissipation, also for seizure purposes, FIUs should be granted the power to suspend the use of a bank account or payment account, crypto-asset account or a business relationship in order to analyse the transactions performed through the account or business relationship, confirm the suspicion and disseminate the results of the analysis to the relevant competent authorities. Given that such suspension would have an impact on the right to property, FIUs should be able to suspend transactions, accounts or business relationships for a limited period in order to preserve the funds, carry out the necessary analyses and disseminate the results of the analyses to the competent authorities for the possible adoption of appropriate measures. Given the more significant impact on an affected person’s fundamental rights, the suspension of an account or business relationship should be imposed for a more limited period, which should be set at 5 working days. Member States can define a longer period of suspension where, pursuant to national law, the FIU exercises competences in the area of asset recovery and carries out functions of tracing, seizing, freezing or confiscating criminal assets. In such cases, the preservation of affected persons’ fundamental rights should be guaranteed and FIUs should exercise their functions in accordance with the appropriate national safeguards. FIUs should lift the suspension of the transaction, account or business relationship as soon as such suspension is no longer necessary. Where a longer suspension period is defined, affected persons whose transactions, accounts or business relationships have been suspended should have the possibility to challenge the suspension order before a court.</p>

Closer monitoring of an account or a business relationship can provide the FIU with additional insights into the account holder’s transaction patterns and lead to the timely detection of unusual or suspicious transactions or activities that might warrant further action by the FIU, including the suspension of the account or the business relationship, the analysis of the intelligence gathered and its dissemination to investigative and prosecutorial authorities. FIUs should also be able to alert obliged entities of information relevant to the performance of customer due diligence. Such alerts can help obliged entities to inform their customer due diligence procedures and ensure their consistency with risks, update their risk assessment and risk management systems accordingly and provide them with additional information that might trigger the need for enhanced due diligence on certain customers or transactions that present higher risks.</p>

When determining the type and frequency of the feedback, FIUs should, insofar as possible, take into account areas where improvements in reporting activities might be needed. In order to support a consistent approach across FIUs and adequate feedback to obliged entities, AMLA should issue recommendations to FIUs on best practices and approaches towards providing feedback. Where this would not jeopardise analytical or investigative work, FIUs could consider providing feedback on the use made or outcome of suspicious transaction reports, whether on individual reports or in an aggregated manner.

FIUs have reported difficulties in exchanging information based on differences in national definitions of certain predicate offences, such as tax crimes, which are not harmonised by Union law. Such differences should not hamper the mutual exchange, the dissemination to other competent authorities and the use of that information. FIUs should rapidly, constructively and effectively ensure the widest range of international cooperation with third countries’ FIUs in relation to money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing in accordance with the applicable data protection rules for data transfers, FATF Recommendations and Egmont Principles for Information Exchange between Financial Intelligence Units. To that end, FIUs should be encouraged to conclude bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding with counterparts from third countries, while taking account of any fundamental rights obligations and of the need to protect the rule of law.</p>

They should also be able to react without undue delay to any suspicion of non-compliance with applicable requirements and take appropriate supervisory measures to address allegations of non-compliance. This will not only help supervisors decide on those cases where the specific risks inherent in a sector are clear and understood, but also provide them with the tools required to further disseminate relevant information to obliged entities in order to inform their understanding of money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p>

This includes disseminations of designations under targeted financial sanctions and UN financial sanctions, which should take place immediately once such designations are made in order to enable the sector to comply with their obligations. As the implementation of AML/CFT requirements by obliged entities involves the processing of personal data, it is important that supervisors are cognisant of guidance and other publications issued by the data protection authorities, either at national level or at Union level through the European Data Protection Board, and that they include that information, as appropriate, in their disseminations to the entities under their supervision.</p>

To that end, supervisors should plan their activities on an annual basis. In doing so, they should not only ensure risk-based coverage of the sectors under their supervision, but also that they are able to react promptly in the event of objective and significant indications of breaches within an obliged entity, including in particular following public revelations or information submitted by whistleblowers. Supervisors should also ensure transparency with respect to the supervisory activities they have carried out, such as supervisory colleges they organised and attended, on-site and off-site supervisory actions taken, pecuniary sanctions imposed or administrative measures applied. AMLA should play a leading role in fostering a common understanding of risks, and should therefore be entrusted with developing the benchmarks and a methodology for assessing and classifying the inherent and residual risk profile of obliged entities, as well as the frequency at which such risk profile should be reviewed.</p>

To that effect, supervisors should be able to report to the FIU instances of suspicions that the obliged entity failed to report or to complement reports submitted by the obliged entity with additional information, which they detect in the course of their supervisory activities. Supervisors should also be able to report suspicions of money laundering, its predicate offences or terrorist financing by the employees of obliged entities, or persons in an equivalent position, by its management or its beneficial owners. It is therefore necessary for Member States to put in place a system that ensures that FIUs are properly and promptly informed. The reporting of suspicions to the FIU should not be understood as replacing the obligation for public authorities to report to the relevant competent authorities any criminal activity they uncover or become aware of in the course of performing their tasks. Information covered by the legal privilege should not be collected or consulted in the context of supervisory tasks, unless the exemptions set out in Regulation (EU) 2024/1624 apply. If supervisors come across or into possession of such information, they should not take it into account for the purposes of their supervisory activities or report it to the FIU.</p>

To be effective, that cooperation has to be used to the greatest extent possible and regardless of the respective nature or status of the supervisors. In addition to traditional cooperation — such as the ability to conduct investigations on behalf of a requesting supervisory authority — it is appropriate to mandate the set-up of AML/CFT supervisory colleges in the financial sector with respect to obliged entities that operate in several Member States through establishments and with respect to obliged entities which are part of a cross-border group. Third-country financial supervisors can be invited to those colleges under certain conditions, including confidentiality requirements equivalent to those incumbent on Union financial supervisors and compliance with Union law regarding the processing and transmission of personal data. The activities of AML/CFT supervisory colleges should be proportionate to the level of risk to which the credit institution or financial institution is exposed, and the scale of cross-border activity.</p>

That requirement was subsequently strengthened to avoid the exchange of information and cooperation between supervisors being prohibited or unreasonably restricted. However, in the absence of a clear legal framework, the set-up of AML/CFT supervisory colleges has been based on non-binding guidelines. It is therefore necessary to establish clear rules for the organisation of AML/CFT colleges and to provide for a coordinated, legally sound approach, recognising the need for structured interaction between supervisors across the Union.

The supervision of the effective implementation of group policy on AML/CFT should be done in accordance with the principles and methods of consolidated supervision as laid down in the relevant Union sectoral legal acts.</p>

However, the quality and intensity of supervision performed by such self-regulatory bodies has been insufficient, and under no, or close to no, public scrutiny. Where a Member State decides to entrust supervision to a self-regulatory body, it should also designate a public authority to oversee the activities of the self-regulatory body to ensure that the performance of those activities is in line with this Directive. That public authority should be a public administration entity and should perform its functions free of undue influence. The functions to be exercised by the public authority overseeing self-regulatory bodies do not imply that the authority should exercise supervisory functions vis-à-vis obliged entities, or take decisions in individual cases handled by the self-regulatory body. However, this does not prevent Member States from allocating additional tasks to that authority if they deem it necessary to achieve the objectives of this Directive. When doing so, Member States should ensure that additional tasks are in line with fundamental rights, and in particular that those tasks do not interfere with the exercise of the right of defence and the confidentiality of lawyer-client communication.</p>

National supervisors should be empowered by Member States to apply such administrative measures to obliged entities to remedy the situation in the case of breaches and, where the breach so justifies, impose pecuniary sanctions. Depending on the organisational systems in place in Member States, such measures and sanctions could also be applied in cooperation between supervisors and other authorities, by delegation from the supervisors to other authorities or by application by the supervisors to judicial authorities. The pecuniary sanctions and administrative measures should be sufficiently broad to allow Member States and supervisors to take account of the differences between obliged entities, in particular between credit institutions and financial institutions and other obliged entities, as regards their size, characteristics and the nature of the business.</p>

Moreover, there is no common understanding among supervisors as to what should constitute a ‘serious’ violation and thus they cannot readily discern when a pecuniary sanction should be imposed. That diversity is detrimental to the efforts made in combating money laundering and terrorist financing and the Union’s response is fragmented. Therefore, common criteria for determining the most appropriate supervisory response to breaches should be laid down and a range of administrative measures that the supervisors could apply to remedy breaches, whether in combination with pecuniary sanctions or, when the breaches are not sufficiently serious to be punished with a pecuniary sanction, on their own, should be provided. In order to incentivise obliged entities to comply with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/1624, it is necessary to strengthen the dissuasive nature of pecuniary sanctions. Accordingly, the minimum amount of the maximum penalty that can be imposed in the case of serious breaches of Regulation (EU) 2024/1624 should be raised. In transposing this Directive, Member States should ensure that the imposition of pecuniary sanctions and application of administrative measures, and the imposition of criminal sanctions in accordance with national law, does not breach the principle of ne bis in idem.</p>

In order to ensure that supervisory action in response to such breaches is effective, the obliged entity should also be held liable for actions taken by those natural persons, whether carried out intentionally or negligently. Without prejudice to the liability of legal persons in criminal proceedings, any intent to derive a benefit for the obliged entity from breaches points to wider failures in the internal policies, procedures and controls of the obliged entity to prevent money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing. Such failures undermine the obliged entity’s role as gatekeeper of the Union’s financial system.

In order to cater for such a diverse range of situations, it is appropriate to allow flexibility as regards the means that supervisors have to impose pecuniary sanctions, apply administrative measures and impose periodic penalty payments. Regardless of the means chosen, it is incumbent on Member States and the authorities involved to ensure that the mechanisms implemented achieve the intended result of restoring compliance and impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate pecuniary sanctions.</p>

The scope of administrative measures applied, and the timing granted to obliged entities to implement the requested actions, depend on the specific breaches or weaknesses identified. Where multiple breaches or weaknesses are identified, different deadlines might apply for the implementation of each individual administrative measure. Consistent with the punitive and educational goal of publications, only decisions to apply administrative measures in relation to breaches of AML/CFT requirements should be published, but not administrative measures applied to prevent such breach.</p>

Where obliged entities fail to comply with administrative measures within the deadline set, it is necessary that supervisors are able to apply enhanced pressure on the obliged entity to restore compliance without delay. To that end, it should be possible for supervisors to impose periodic penalty payments as of the deadline set for restoring compliance, including with retroactive effect when the decision imposing the periodic penalty payment is taken at a later stage. In calculating the amounts of periodic penalty payments, supervisors should take into account the overall turnover of the obliged entity and the type and gravity of the breach or weakness targeted by the supervisory measure to ensure its effectiveness and proportionality. Given their goal of pressuring an obliged entity into complying with an administrative measure, periodic penalty payments should be limited in time and apply for no longer than 6 months. While it should be possible for supervisors to renew the imposition of periodic penalty payments for another 6 months maximum, alternative measures to address an extended situation of non-compliance should be considered, consistent with the wide range of administrative measures that supervisors can apply.</p>

In that regard, cooperation between all national and Union AML/CFT authorities is of the utmost importance and should be clarified and enhanced. It remains the duty of Member States to provide for the necessary rules to ensure that at national level policy makers, the FIUs, supervisors, including AMLA, and other competent authorities involved in AML/CFT, as well as tax authorities and law enforcement authorities when acting within the scope of this Directive, have effective mechanisms to enable them to cooperate and coordinate, including through a restrictive approach to the refusal by competent authorities to cooperate and exchange information at the request of another competent authority. Irrespective of the mechanisms put in place, such national cooperation should result in an effective system to prevent and combat money laundering, its predicate offences and terrorist financing, and to prevent the non-implementation and evasion of targeted financial sanctions.</p>

Information of a prudential nature relating to credit institutions and financial institutions, such as information relating to the fitness and properness of directors and shareholders, to the internal control mechanisms, to governance or to compliance and risk management, is often indispensable for the adequate AML/CFT supervision of such institutions. Similarly, AML/CFT information is also important for the prudential supervision of such institutions. Therefore, cooperation and exchange of information with AML/CFT supervisors and FIU should be extended to all competent authorities in charge of the supervision of those obliged entities in accordance with other Union legal instruments, such as Directives 2013/36/EU <a id="ntc23-L_202401640EN.000101-E0023" href="#ntr23-L_202401640EN.000101-E0023"

Credit institutions might choose to terminate or restrict business relationships with customers or categories of customers in order to avoid, rather than manage, risk. Such de-risking practices could weaken the AML/CFT framework and the detection of suspicious transactions, as they push affected customers to resort to less secure or unregulated payment channels to meet their financial needs. At the same time, widespread de-risking practices in the banking sector could lead to financial exclusion for certain categories of payment entities or consumers. Financial supervisors are best placed to identify situations where a credit institution has refused to enter into a business relationship despite possibly being obliged to do so on the basis of the national law implementing Directive 2014/92/EU or Directive (EU) 2015/2366, and without a justification based on the documented customer due diligence. Financial supervisors should alert the authorities responsible for ensuring compliance by financial institution with Directive 2014/92/EU or Directive (EU) 2015/2366 when such cases arise or where business relationships are terminated as a result of de-risking practices.</p>

The data subject has the right to request that a supervisory authority as referred to in Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or, where applicable, the European Data Protection Supervisor, check the lawfulness of the processing and has the right to seek a judicial remedy as referred to in Article 79 of that Regulation. The supervisory authority referred to in Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 can also act on an ex officio basis. Without prejudice to the restrictions on the right to access, the supervisory authority should be able to inform the data subject that it has carried out all necessary verifications, and of the result as regards the lawfulness of the processing in question.</p>

In order to ensure legal clarity, it is important to adapt that provision by clarifying that only persons or organisations with legitimate interest should be able to access that information. The same condition should apply to the access to information on beneficial ownership of trusts or similar legal arrangements. Directive (EU) 2015/849 should therefore be amended. The implications of that judgement extend beyond Article 30(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and are similar for the provisions regulating access to beneficial ownership information of legal arrangements. In order to ensure that the Union framework strikes the right balance between the protection of fundamental rights and the pursuit of a legitimate objective of general interest such as the protection of the Union’s financial system against money laundering and terrorist financing, it is therefore appropriate to introduce amendments to Article 31(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849. Member States should be granted one year from the date of entry into force of this Directive to bring into force the necessary laws, regulations and administrative measures to transpose those amendments. Given the importance of ensuring a proportionate Union AML/CFT framework, Member States should make every effort to transpose those amendments as soon as possible before that deadline.</p>
