There is therefore a need for a broad-based legislative framework of a horizontal nature to fill gaps and to complement provisions in existing or forthcoming sector-specific Union harmonisation legislation and ensure consumer protection not otherwise ensured by that legislation, in particular with a view to achieving a high level of protection of the health and safety of consumers, as required by Articles 114 and 169 TFEU.</p>

In particular, the general product safety requirement and related provisions should apply to consumer products covered by Union harmonisation legislation when certain types of risks are not covered by that Union harmonisation legislation. The provisions of this Regulation concerning the obligations of providers of online marketplaces, the obligations of economic operators in the event of accidents, the right to information and to a remedy for consumers as well as the product safety recalls should apply to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation to the extent that there are no specific provisions with the same objective in such Union harmonisation legislation. Likewise, RAPEX is already used for the purposes of Union harmonisation legislation, as referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020: therefore the provisions of this Regulation regulating the Safety Gate and its functioning should apply to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation.</p>

Those risks can also include environmental risk insofar as it poses a risk to the health and safety of consumers. That assessment should take into account the health risk posed by digitally connected products, including the risk to mental health, especially of vulnerable consumers, in particular children. Therefore, when assessing the safety of digitally connected products likely to have an impact on children, manufacturers should ensure that the products they make available on the market meet the highest standards of safety, security and privacy by design, in the best interests of children. Furthermore, if specific information is necessary to make products safe for a certain category of persons, the assessment of the safety of the products should take into consideration also the presence of that information and its accessibility. The safety of all products should be assessed taking into consideration the need for the product to be safe over its entire lifespan.</p>

Product identification and the provision of information on the manufacturer and other relevant economic operators thus ensures that consumers, including persons with disabilities, and market surveillance authorities obtain accurate information regarding dangerous products, which enhances confidence in the market and avoids unnecessary disruption of trade. Products should therefore bear information allowing their identification and the identification of the manufacturer and, where applicable, of the importer and other relevant economic operators. Such requirements could be made stricter for certain kinds of products that are likely to present a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers, by a system of collection and storage of data enabling, besides the identification of the product, the identification of its components or of the economic operators involved in its supply chain.

In such a case, the entity in question would therefore have to comply with the obligations applicable to the relevant economic operator. For instance, if the provider of the online marketplace also distributes a product, then, with respect to the sale of the distributed product, it would be considered to be a distributor. Similarly, if the entity in question sells its own branded products, it would act as a manufacturer and would thus need to comply with the applicable requirements for manufacturers. Also, some entities can qualify as fulfilment service providers if they offer fulfilment services. Such cases would thus need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Consumers should also be protected against dangerous products in the same way in the offline and online sales channels, including when purchasing products on online marketplaces. Building on the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 concerning the traceability of traders, providers of online marketplaces should not allow a specific product offer to be listed on their platforms unless the trader has provided all information related to product safety and traceability as specified in this Regulation. Such information should be displayed together with the product listing so that consumers can benefit from the same information made available online and offline. However, providers of online marketplaces should not be responsible for verifying the completeness, correctness and the accuracy of the information itself, as the obligation to ensure the traceability of products lies with the relevant trader.</p>

Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 imposes an obligation on information society service providers to cooperate with market surveillance authorities in relation to products covered by that Regulation. That obligation should therefore be extended to all consumer products. For instance, market surveillance authorities are constantly improving the technological tools they use for online market surveillance to identify dangerous products sold online. For those tools to be operational, providers of online marketplaces should grant access to their interfaces. Moreover, for the purpose of product safety, market surveillance authorities should also have the possibility to scrape data from an online interface upon reasoned request in the case of technical obstacles put in place by providers of online marketplaces or online sellers. Providers of online marketplaces should also cooperate on product recalls and on accident reporting.</p>

It is opportune to change the abbreviated name from RAPEX to Safety Gate for greater clarity and better outreach to consumers. Safety Gate comprises three elements: first, a rapid alert system on dangerous non-food products whereby national authorities and the Commission can exchange information on such products (Safety Gate Rapid Alert System); second, a web portal to inform the public and enable them to submit complaints (Safety Gate Portal); and third, a web portal to enable businesses to comply with their obligation to inform authorities and consumers of dangerous products and accidents (Safety Business Gateway). Interfaces should exist between the different Safety Gate elements. The Safety Gate Rapid Alert System is the internal system through which authorities and the Commission exchange information on measures concerning dangerous products, and which can contain confidential information. An extract of alerts should be published on the Safety Gate Portal in order to inform the public about dangerous products. The Safety Business Gateway is the web portal through which businesses inform market surveillance authorities of the Member States about dangerous products and about accidents. The Commission should develop a technical solution to ensure that the information entered by businesses in the Safety Business Gateway that is meant to alert consumers can be made available to consumers on the Safety Gate Portal without undue delay. In addition, the Commission should develop an interoperable interface to enable providers of online marketplaces to link their interfaces with the Safety Gate Portal in an easy, quick and reliable way.</p>

Member States and the Commission should make available to the public information relating to risks to the health and safety of consumers posed by products. It is opportune for consumers and businesses that all information on corrective measures taken against products presenting a serious risk is contained in the Safety Gate Rapid Alert System, allowing relevant information on dangerous products to be made available to the public through the Safety Gate Portal. It is important to ensure that all of that information is available in the official language(s) of the consumer’s Member State of residence and that it is written in a clear and understandable manner.

                           <p class="oj-normal">When a product already sold to consumers turns out to be dangerous, it may need to be recalled to protect consumers in the Union. Consumers might not be aware that they own a recalled product. In order to increase recall effectiveness, it is therefore important to better reach the consumers concerned. Direct contact is the most effective method to increase consumers’ awareness of recalls and encourage action. It is also the preferred communication channel across all groups of consumers. In order to ensure the safety of the consumers, it is important that they are informed in a quick and reliable way. Economic operators and, where applicable, providers of online marketplaces should therefore use the customer data at their disposal to inform consumers of recalls and safety warnings linked to products they have purchased. Therefore, a legal obligation is needed to require economic operators and providers of online marketplaces to use any customer data already at their disposal to inform consumers of recalls and safety warnings. In that respect, economic operators and providers of online marketplaces should ensure that they include the possibility to directly contact customers in the case of a recall or safety warning affecting them in existing customer loyalty programmes and product registration systems, through which customers are asked, after having purchased a product, to communicate to the manufacturer on a voluntary basis some information such as their name, contact information, the product model or serial number. The mere fact that recalls are targeted at consumers should not prevent economic operators and providers of online marketplaces from making all customers aware of a product recall notice nor from offering remedies to other end-users. Economic operators and providers of online marketplaces should be encouraged to take such actions, especially in the case of micro- and small enterprises acting like consumers.</p>

Article 14 of Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc20-L_2023135EN.01000101-E0020" href="#ntr20-L_2023135EN.01000101-E0020"

However, situations where dangerous products are recalled from the market justify having a specific set of rules that should be applied without prejudice to contractual remedies because their objectives are different. Whereas contractual remedies serve the purpose of remedying the lack of conformity of the goods with the contract, the remedies in the event of a recall serve both to ensure elimination of dangerous products from the market and an adequate remedy for the consumer. As a consequence, there are major differences between the two sets of potential remedies: firstly, in the event of a product recall under this Regulation, there should be no time limitation to activate the remedies; secondly, the consumer should be entitled to request remedies from the relevant economic operator, not necessarily from the trader. Moreover, in the event of a recall, the consumer should not have to prove that the product is dangerous.</p>

However, if other requirements for conformity regarding the same good are not fulfilled, the seller would remain liable for such non-conformity of the good with the contract even if there has been a remedy provided to the consumer following a recall of a dangerous product.</p>

Moreover, the repair by the consumer should be without prejudice to consumers’ rights under Directives (EU) 2019/770 and (EU) 2019/771.

Furthermore, that Directive was adopted at a time where the legal framework for consumer product safety was very limited in scope. For those reasons, Directive 87/357/EEC should be repealed and replaced by this Regulation, in particular, the provisions of this Regulation which ensure that, following risk assessment, products which can be harmful when placed in mouth, sucked or ingested and which are likely to be confused with foodstuff due to their form, odour, colour, appearance, packaging, labelling, volume, size or other characteristics, should be considered dangerous. In performing their evaluation, market surveillance authorities should take into consideration, inter alia, that, as held by the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is not necessary to demonstrate by objective and substantiated data that placing in the mouth, sucking or ingesting food-imitating products may entail risks such as suffocation, poisoning, or the perforation or obstruction of the digestive tract. Nevertheless, the competent national authorities should assess on a case-by-case basis whether such products are dangerous and justify that assessment.</p>
