The Union Mechanism does so by strengthening the Union’s collective response to natural and man-made disasters through the establishment of a reserve of capacities that complement the existing capacities of Member States, when capacities available at national level are not sufficient, thereby enabling more effective preparedness and response, and by enhancing disaster prevention and preparedness. Adequate financial appropriations are required in order to establish, deploy and operate rescEU capacities and to be able to further develop the European Civil Protection Pool and cover additional costs stemming from adaptation grants and the operation of capacities committed to the European Civil Protection Pool.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The unprecedented experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that the Union and Member States need to be better prepared to respond to large-scale emergencies that impact several Member States simultaneously, and that the existing legal framework on health and civil protection should be reinforced. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted how the consequences of disasters for human health, the environment, society and the economy can take on devastating proportions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union was able, based on the existing provisions of Decision No 1313/2013/EU, to rapidly adopt implementing provisions to expand rescEU capacities to include stockpiling of medical countermeasures comprising vaccines and therapeutics, and of intensive care medical equipment, personal protective equipment and laboratory supplies, for the purpose of preparedness and response to a serious cross-border threat to health. In order to enhance effectiveness regarding preparedness and response actions, new provisions strengthening the current legal framework, including by enabling the Commission to directly procure, under specific conditions, the necessary rescEU capacities, could further reduce deployment time in the future. It is also important that the operations of rescEU be well coordinated with national civil protection authorities.</p>

Natural disasters, such as forest fires, can lead to loss of lives, livelihoods and biodiversity, cause the release of high amounts of carbon emissions, and cause a decrease in the carbon absorption capacity of the planet, which further exacerbates climate change. It is therefore essential that prevention of, preparedness for and response to disasters be strengthened and that the Union Mechanism comprise sufficient capacities, including during the rescEU transitional period, to act when forest fires and other climate-related natural disasters occur.</p>

To that effect, the Commission should work together with Member States to define and develop Union disaster resilience goals in the area of civil protection, as a non-binding common baseline to support prevention and preparedness actions in the event of disasters with a high impact which cause or are capable of causing multi-country transboundary effects (i.e. effects on several countries, irrespective of whether they share a border or not). The Union disaster resilience goals should take into account the immediate social consequences of disasters and the need to ensure that critical societal functions are preserved.</p>

Copernicus Emergency Management Systems provide support to the ERCC in the various emergency phases from early warning and prevention to disaster response and recovery. GOVSATCOM serves to provide secure satellite communication capability specifically tailored to the needs of governmental users in emergency management. Galileo is the first global satellite navigation and positioning infrastructure specifically designed for civilian purposes in Europe and worldwide, and can be used in other areas such as emergency management, including early warning activities. Galileo’s relevant services include an emergency service which broadcasts, through emitting signals, warnings regarding natural or man-made disasters in particular areas. Given its potential for saving lives and facilitating the coordination of emergency actions, Member States should be encouraged to use Galileo. Where they decide to use it, in order to validate the system, Member States should identify the national authorities that are competent to use Galileo and notify the Commission of those authorities.</p>

Therefore, transport and logistical resources should be defined as rescEU capacities.

As shown in the recent COVID-19 crisis, financial resources required to ensure an adequate response can vary significantly from year to year and should be made available immediately. Reconciling the budgetary principle of predictability with the necessity to react rapidly to new needs therefore means having to adapt the financial implementation of the work programmes. Consequently, it is appropriate to authorise carry-over of unused appropriations, limited to the following year and solely devoted to response actions, in addition to the carry-over of appropriations authorised under Article 12(4) of the Financial Regulation.</p>

It is important to achieve the necessary balance in the fulfilment of those objectives. In order to update the percentages set out in Annex I according to the priorities of the Union Mechanism, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making <a id="ntc23-L_2021185EN.01000101-E0023" href="#ntr23-L_2021185EN.01000101-E0023"
