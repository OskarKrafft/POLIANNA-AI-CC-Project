Such movement contributes, among other things, to making the Union maritime transport sector attractive to future generations, thereby avoiding a situation whereby the European maritime cluster is faced with a shortage of competent staff with the right mix of skills and competencies. The mutual recognition of seafarers’ certificates issued by Member States is essential to facilitate the free movement of seafarers. In the light of the right to good administration, Member States’ decisions in respect of the acceptance of certificates of proficiency issued to seafarers by other Member States for the purpose of issuing national certificates of competency should be based on reasons that are capable of being ascertained by the seafarer concerned.</p>

That Directive also allows for the possibility to authorise exceptions to the minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The possibility to authorise exceptions should, however, be limited in terms of the maximum duration, frequency and scope. The Manila amendments aimed, amongst other things, to set objective limits to the exceptions to the minimum rest hours for watchkeeping personnel and seafarers with designated tasks related to safety, security and the prevention of pollution, with a view to preventing fatigue. Therefore, this Directive should reflect the Manila amendments in a manner that ensures coherence with Directive 1999/63/EC.</p>

Directive 2005/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc9-L_2022169EN.01004501-E0009" href="#ntr9-L_2022169EN.01004501-E0009"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">9</span>)</a> regulated the mutual recognition of seafarers’ certificates issued by the Member States. However, the definitions of seafarers’ certificates referred to in Directive 2005/45/EC became obsolete following the 2010 amendments to the STCW Convention. Therefore, the mutual recognition scheme of seafarers’ certificates issued by Member States should be regulated so as to reflect the international amendments. In addition, the seafarers’ medical certificates issued under the authority of Member States should also be included in the mutual recognition scheme. In order to avoid any ambiguity and the risk of inconsistencies between Directive 2005/45/EC and this Directive, the mutual recognition of seafarers’ certificates should be regulated by this Directive only. Furthermore, in order to reduce the administrative burden on Member States, an electronic system for the presentation of seafarers’ qualifications should be introduced once the relevant amendments to the STCW Convention have been adopted.</p>
