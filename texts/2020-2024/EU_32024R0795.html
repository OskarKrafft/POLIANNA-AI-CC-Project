                           <p class="oj-normal">The Union’s industry has proven its inbuilt resilience but its competitiveness must also be ensured in the future. High inflation, labour shortages, post-COVID supply chain disruptions, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, rising interest rates, and increases in energy costs and input prices are weighing on the competitiveness of the Union’s industry and have highlighted the importance for the Union to secure its open strategic autonomy and reduce its strategic dependence on third countries in various sectors. Those pressures on the Union’s industry are paired with strong, but not always fair, competition on the fragmented global market. The Union has already launched several initiatives to support its industry, such as the Green Deal Industrial Plan, set out in the Commission communication of 1 February 2023 entitled ‘A Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age’, a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for ensuring a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials (the ‘Critical Raw Materials Act’), a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework of measures for strengthening Europe’s net-zero technology products manufacturing ecosystem (the ‘Net-Zero Industry Act’), the new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State aid, set out in the Commission communication of 17 March 2023 entitled ‘Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia’, the European Union Recovery Instrument established by Council Regulation (EU) 2020/2094 <a id="ntc5-L_202400795EN.000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_202400795EN.000101-E0005"

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">6</span>)</a>. While those solutions provide fast, targeted and, in some cases, temporary support, the Union needs a more structural answer to the investment needs of its industries, safeguarding cohesion, creating quality jobs, and preserving the level playing field in the internal market, while facilitating access to funding. The Union should work to prevent relocation, to transfer production facilities of critical technologies back from third countries, and to attract new facilities to prevent strategic dependencies.</p>

Therefore, immediate action is required to support the development and manufacturing in the Union of critical technologies, which constitute the Union’s primary strategic deficiencies. Developing and manufacturing critical technologies, builds upon the value chains of interlinked economic actors, operating across firms of different sizes, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), sectors and borders. Therefore, the Union should also safeguard and strengthen the value chains of those critical technologies and their associated services that are critical for and specific to the activities of developing or manufacturing those critical technologies, thereby reducing the Union’s strategic dependencies and preserving the integrity of the internal market, and should address existing labour and skills shortages in those sectors through life-long learning, education, training projects and apprenticeships and the creation of attractive quality jobs accessible to all.</p>

When assessing the economic potential of critical technologies to the internal market, account should be taken of the fact that measures carried out in a single Member State can have spillover effects in other Member States. When assessing whether a technology contributes to reducing or preventing the strategic dependencies of the Union, account should be taken of the analysis carried out at Union level to identify the risks which have potential effects on the entire Union. The Commission should issue guidance on how the technologies in the three sectors within the scope of this Regulation could be considered to be critical, as well as the conditions on the basis of which those technologies can qualify as critical, in order to promote a common interpretation of the projects, companies and sectors to be supported under the relevant programmes in light of the common strategic objectives of the relevant programmes and this Regulation. In that guidance the Commission should also clarify the notion of value chain and associated services that are critical for and specific to the development or manufacturing of the final products. That guidance should be without prejudice to other guidance on specific programmes.</p>

Deep tech innovation should be understood to be those that have the potential to deliver transformative solutions, rooted in cutting-edge science, technology and engineering, including innovation that combines advances in the physical, biological and digital spheres. Digital technologies should include, in particular, those that contribute to the targets and objectives of the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030, as well as multi-country projects as defined in Decision (EU) 2022/2481. Clean and resource-efficient technologies should include, in particular, net-zero technologies as defined in the Net-Zero Industry Act.

However, labour and skills shortages, which have increased in all sectors including those considered key for the green and digital transitions, are expected to increase further in light of demographic change and endanger the rise of technologies in the relevant sectors identified in this Regulation. It is therefore necessary to boost the participation of more people in the labour market of the relevant sectors, in particular through investments in learning and life-long learning, the enhancement of relevant skills and the creation of quality jobs and apprenticeships for young and disadvantaged persons who are not in employment, education or training. Such support will complement a number of other actions that have the aim of meeting the skills needs stemming from the green and digital transitions outlined in the EU Skills Agenda set out in the Commission communication of 1 July 2020 entitled ‘European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience’. Those actions have an important role to play in promoting a mindset of reskilling and upskilling, boosting the competitiveness of Union undertakings, in particular SMEs, and contributing to the creation of quality jobs with a view to realising the full potential of the green and digital transitions in a socially fair, inclusive and just manner.</p>

Therefore, a Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) should be set up in order to contribute to providing an answer to Union investment needs by helping to better channel the existing Union funds towards critical investment, including in Union-wide and cross-border projects, that have the aim of supporting the development or manufacturing of critical technologies in strategic sectors, while preserving a level playing field in the internal market, preserving cohesion and that have the aim of achieving a geographically balanced distribution of projects financed under the STEP in accordance with the respective programme mandates.</p>

Managing authorities are encouraged to promote the collaboration between large enterprises and local SMEs, supply chains, innovation and technology ecosystems. That would allow for the reinforcement of the Union’s overall capacity to strengthen its position in those sectors by providing access to all Member States for such investments, thus counteracting the risk of increasing disparities.

In that context, the Commission should encourage and assist the implementing partners other than the EIB Group to absorb the funding that is available to them in full. Member States are encouraged to contribute to the Member State compartment of InvestEU to support financial products in line with the STEP objectives under the current policy windows, without prejudice to applicable State aid rules. It should be possible for Member States to include as a measure in their recovery and resilience plans a cash contribution for the purpose of the Member State compartment of InvestEU to support STEP objectives under the current policy windows.

Additional flexibility and clarifications should also be introduced to better pursue the STEP objectives.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Horizon Europe is the Union’s key funding programme for research and innovation, and the European Innovation Council (EIC) provides for support, in particular for innovations with breakthrough potential and of a disruptive nature with scale-up potential that may be too risky for private investors. Additional flexibility should be provided for under Horizon Europe, so that the EIC Accelerator can provide equity-only support to non-bankable SMEs, including start-ups, and non-bankable small mid-caps, carrying out innovation, in particular to those working on the technologies supported by the STEP, regardless of whether they previously received other types of support from the EIC Accelerator. The implementation of the financial instrument which is the part of the EIC Accelerator that provides investment through equity or other repayable form (the ‘EIC Fund’) is currently limited to a maximum investment amount of EUR 15 million except in exceptional cases and cannot accommodate follow-up financing rounds or larger investment amounts. Allowing for equity-only support for non-bankable SMEs and small mid-caps would address the existing market gap, in particular for investment needs in the range of EUR 15 to 50 million. Moreover, experience has shown that the amounts committed for the EIC Pilot under Horizon 2020 established by Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc26-L_202400795EN.000101-E0026" href="#ntr26-L_202400795EN.000101-E0026"
