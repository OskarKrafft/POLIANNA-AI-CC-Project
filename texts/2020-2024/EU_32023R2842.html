Considering the possible impacts of small-scale fisheries on stocks, it is important to ensure that fishing activities and fishing effort of smaller vessels are in compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Therefore, Member States should be able to track all fishing vessels, including fishing vessels of less than 12 metres in length overall, and to receive position data from them at regular and sufficiently short intervals. To further facilitate the use of tracking systems for small-scale vessels, the Commission should develop, at the request of one or more Member States, a tracking system for vessels of less than 12 metres in length overall. However, Member States should be able to exempt certain small-scale vessels from the tracking obligation during a limited period, in order to allow sufficient time to prepare for the use of new tools for those vessels. In any event, the implementation of those measures should be balanced and proportionate to the objectives pursued and should not entail an excessive burden for the fleet, especially the small-scale fleet, which may benefit from aid under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc10-L_202302842EN.000101-E0010" href="#ntr10-L_202302842EN.000101-E0010"

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the Union fisheries control system, in particular as regards the monitoring of compliance with the landing obligation, it is necessary to equip, on the basis of a risk assessment, certain catching vessels with remote electronic monitoring (REM) systems on board. Those systems should include closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. CCTV data should not be live-streamed. In order to safeguard the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, recording of video material through CCTV should only be allowed in relation to the gear and those parts of the vessels where fishery products are brought on board, handled and stored or where discarding can occur. Recording activity should be limited to those situations where gear is actively operated, such as the shooting of gear or hauling or removing gear from the water, and where catch is taken on board and handled by the crew or where discarding can occur. The possibility to identify individual persons in the recorded video material should be limited to the extent possible, and where necessary the data should be anonymised. To ensure clarity and consistency, rules on access by competent authorities to data from those REM systems should be set out. Footage from CCTV should be made available exclusively for the purposes of control and inspection set out in Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, to the authorities specified in that Regulation.</p>

However, the introduction of more multiannual plans has increased the instances where, in certain circumstances, it might be difficult for masters to fulfil that obligation, due to reasons such as limited storage space on board, many species in small quantities retained on board, catches kept on board in refrigerated seawater tanks, the number of different stocks caught in a certain fishery, or out of concern for the safety of the crew. For such cases, there should be a possibility to provide for exemptions from the obligation to stow catches separately.</p>

To improve compliance with the rules on catch registration, the provisions on prior notifications should apply to all vessels of 12 metres in length overall or more and not only to fishing vessels targeting stocks under multiannual plans. However, it should be possible for coastal Member States to set a shorter period for prior notification for certain categories of vessels, as long as this does not impair the ability of their competent authorities to inspect vessels upon arrival.</p>

Moreover, conducting fishing activities with the use of forced labour is contrary to the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular that fishing activities are to be managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving social and employment benefit and are to contribute to a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities. It also undermines a level playing field for fishery and aquaculture products marketed in the Union. Therefore, conducting fishing activities with the use of forced labour should be regarded as a serious infringement, without prejudice to any criminal sanctions for forced labour in accordance with Member States’ obligations under the ILO Convention No 29 on Forced Labour.</p>

In particular, for the purpose of monitoring of fishing opportunities, including quota uptake, ensuring compliance with other management and conservation measures, monitoring fishing activities, or performing assessment allowing for risk-based control, Member States need to process vessel position data, fishing logbooks, landing declarations, sales notes and other fishing activity data in order to carry out validation and cross checks. That is necessary to ensure that data submitted by operators are complete and accurate and that operators comply with the rules of the common fisheries policy. In order to be able to control and evaluate the application of the rules of the common fisheries policy through verifications, inspections or audits and to monitor the control activities of Member States, the Commission or the body designated by it should have access to and be able to process, in addition to fishing activity data, data contained in inspection and control observer reports and data pertaining to infringements. Moreover, in the context of preparation and monitoring of compliance with international agreements and conservation measures, the Commission should be able to process data on the fishing activities of Union fishing vessels outside Union waters, including the vessel identification numbers, and the names of the owner of the vessel and the master of the vessel. The processing of fishing activity data could also be necessary for the purpose of proving, defending or establishing fishing rights of individual fishing vessels, Member States or the Union.</p>
