Such measures by Member States can result in imposing diverging regulation on market operators, in providing different levels of access to the supply of net-zero technologies across Member States, including by providing different levels of support for net-zero technology manufacturing projects, and in providing for diverging rules and uncoordinated forms of procurement, diverging processes and durations in relation to permit-granting processes thus creating obstacles to the cross-border trade between Member States and hindering the proper functioning of the internal market. To safeguard the functioning of the internal market it is therefore necessary to create a common Union legal framework to collectively address that central challenge by increasing the Union’s resilience and security of supply in the field of net-zero technologies.</p>

The first pillar aims to create a regulatory environment that simplifies and streamlines permit- granting processes for new net-zero technology manufacturing and assembly sites, and to facilitate the scaling up of the Union’s net-zero industry. The second pillar aims to boost investment in and financing of net-zero technology production by means of the revised Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia established in the Commission communication of 17 March 2023 and the creation of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc6-L_202401735EN.000101-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_202401735EN.000101-E0006"

The third pillar relates to developing the skills needed to make the transition happen and to increase the number of skilled workers in the clean energy technology sector. The fourth pillar focuses on trade and the diversification of the supply chain of critical raw materials. That includes creating a critical raw materials club, working with like-minded partners to collectively strengthen supply chains and diversifying from single suppliers for critical input. This Regulation forms part of those measures and contributes to enhancing the business case for industrial decarbonisation in the Union.</p>

At transmission level, high-voltage direct current systems are needed, inter alia, to connect offshore renewable energies, while at distribution level, connecting electricity providers and managing demand-side flexibility builds on investments in innovative grid technologies, such as electric vehicles smart charging, energy efficiency building and industry automation and smart controls, advanced meter infrastructure and home energy management systems. The electricity grid needs to interact with many actors or devices on the basis of a detailed level of observability, and hence availability of data, to enable flexibility, smart charging, smart buildings with smart electricity grids and small-scale flexibility services enabling demand-side response from consumers and the uptake of renewables. Connecting the net-zero technologies to the network of the Union requires the substantial expansion of manufacturing capabilities for electricity grids in areas such as offshore and onshore cables, substations and transformers.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Certain specific components in the supply chain of net-zero technologies are produced through energy-intensive production processes namely in the steel, aluminium, non-ferrous metals, basic chemicals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, fertilisers, as well as pulp and paper sectors. Many of those processes are characterised by a high energy and carbon intensity, making their CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions usually hard to abate. At the same time, Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 requires rapid decarbonisation of the Union’s economy. In light of the fact that energy-intensive industries accounted for 17 % of overall greenhouse gas emissions in the Union in 2019, their decarbonisation is indispensable to reach climate neutrality in the Union. That means that the security of supply in the Union of specific components used for net-zero technologies also depends on intensifying decarbonisation efforts in energy-intensive industries. Energy-intensive industry facilities fall under the scope of this Regulation where the relevant facilities produce specific components that are primarily used in net-zero technologies. Due to the need to decarbonise those sectors as a whole and in order to ensure the availability of specific components produced by them that are used in the net-zero technology supply chains, unlike other net-zero technology manufacturing projects to which this Regulation applies, this Regulation should also apply to projects of energy-intensive industries that produce specific components that are used, but not exclusively so in the supply chains of net-zero technologies. The inclusion of such hard-to-abate facilities in the scope of this Regulation should be conditional on a project comprising the construction or conversion of such a facility leading to a significant reduction of CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emissions stemming from the production activities. Supporting those sectors in a targeted manner under this Regulation contributes to ensuring access to a sustainable supply of net-zero technologies in the internal market, increases investment certainty and creates a demand-side pull for net-zero transformative and decarbonisation technologies.</p>

The Union needs to ensure that the regulatory environment for manufacturers of photovoltaic (PV) technologies enables them to increase their competitive edge and improve security of supply perspectives, by aiming to reach at least 30 gigawatt of operational PV manufacturing capacity by 2030 across the full PV value chain, in line with the goals set out in the European Solar Photovoltaic Industry Alliance, which is supported under the Union’s Solar Energy Strategy established by the Commission communication of 18 May 2022. The Union needs to ensure that the regulatory environment for manufacturers of wind and heat pump technologies enables them to consolidate their competitive edge and maintain or expand their current market shares throughout the 2020s, in line with the Union’s technology deployment projections that meet its 2030 energy and climate targets. This translates into a Union manufacturing capacity for wind of at least 36 GW and for heat pumps of at least 31 GW by 2030. Union manufacturers of batteries and electrolysers need to find a regulatory environment that enables them to consolidate their technology leadership and actively contribute to shaping those markets. For battery technologies, that would mean contributing to the objectives of the European Battery Alliance and aim to meet almost 90 % of the Union’s battery annual demand by the Union’s battery manufacturers, meaning a Union manufacturing capacity of at least 550 GWh by 2030. For Union electrolyser manufacturers, the REPowerEU plan projects 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production and up to 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen imports by 2030. To ensure that the Union’s technological leadership translates into commercial leadership, as supported under the Electrolyser Joint Declaration of the Commission and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, Union electrolyser manufacturers should be enabled to further boost their capacity, so that the overall installed electrolyser capacity being deployed reaches at least 100 GW hydrogen by 2030. The RePowerEU plan also sets an objective of boosting sustainable biomethane production to 35 billion cubic meter by 2030. With its supply chain largely based in Europe today, biomethane already makes a contribution to the Union’s resilience and should be further promoted. Union manufacturers of aviation and maritime fuels need to further develop, produce and scale up sustainable alternative fuels in order to significantly contribute to the reduction of the transport sector’s greenhouse gas emissions by 90 % in 2050, as well as to meet the obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc11-L_202401735EN.000101-E0011" href="#ntr11-L_202401735EN.000101-E0011"

In order to maintain competitiveness and reduce current strategic import dependencies in net-zero technology products and their supply chains, while avoiding the formation of new ones, the Union needs to continue strengthening its net-zero industrial base and become more competitive and open to innovation. Together with other measures to enhance the Union’s competitiveness, measures to increase the manufacturing capacity in the Union should also ensure that the Union play a dominant role in strategic parts of the global value chain, including final products, to ensure the level of security of supply that the Union needs for the purpose of achieving its climate and energy objectives. Therefore, a second overall benchmark should be established. The Union’s manufacturing capacity for net-zero technologies should aim to reach an increased share of world production, with a view to reaching 15 % of world production in value by 2040, on the basis of the monitoring as provided for in this Regulation. That second benchmark should not apply where the increased Union’s manufacturing capacity would be significantly higher than the Union’s deployment needs for the corresponding technologies necessary to achieve the Union’s climate and energy targets.</p>

For that reason, permit-granting processes of the Member States for net-zero technology manufacturing projects, including net-zero strategic projects, should be streamlined, while ensuring that such projects are safe, secure, environmentally sustainable, and comply with environmental, social and safety requirements.

Considering the size of the required investments, in particular for gigafactory-size projects which are needed to reach the expected economies of scale, inadequate permit-granting processes create an additional and often detrimental barrier to increasing net-zero technology manufacturing capacity in the Union. In order to provide project promoters and other investors with the security and clarity needed to increase development of net-zero technology manufacturing projects, Member States should ensure that the permit-granting process related to such projects does not exceed pre-set time limits. For net-zero strategic projects, the length of the permit-granting process should not exceed 12 months for facilities with a yearly production output of 1 GW or more, nine months for those with a yearly production output of less than 1 GW, or 18 months for all necessary permits to operate a strategic CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> storage site and the deployment of related CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> capture and CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> transport projects. For net-zero technology manufacturing projects, the length of the permit-granting process should not exceed 18 months for facilities with a yearly production output of 1 GW or more, and 12 months for those with a yearly production output of less than 1 GW. For net-zero technologies for which the GW metric is not relevant, such as grids and carbon capture and storage (CCS) or CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> transport and utilisation technologies, the upper limits of the those deadlines should apply. However, the first step of the environmental impact assessment pursuant to Directive 2011/92/EU, which consists of the preparation of an environmental impact assessment report, is often predominantly performed by the project promoter. That step should therefore not be integrated in the timelines which the Member States are bound by as referred to in the permit-granting process. To that end, the single point of contact should notify the date by which the project promoter needs to submit the environmental impact assessment report, and any period between that notified date and the actual submission of the report should not be counted towards the timeline. The same principle should apply where, after the required consultations, the single point of contact notifies the project promoter of the opportunity to submit additional information to complete the environmental impact assessment report. In exceptional cases related to the nature, complexity, location or size of the proposed project, Member States should be able to extend the timelines. Such exceptional cases could include unforeseen circumstances triggering the need to add to or complete environmental assessments related to the project, or delays due to expropriation processes where required.</p>

They bring additional benefits, in particular with regard to the reduction of the Union dependencies or the achievement of the Energy Union and climate goals. Net-zero manufacturing projects can contribute to strengthening the technological and industrial resilience of the Union by increasing manufacturing capacity for a key segment of a supply chain. In particular, adding manufacturing capacity for sectors for which the Union’s manufacturing capacity represents a significant share of world production, and which play a crucial role in the resilience of the Union, makes it possible to strengthen the Union’s position in the global net-zero manufacturing supply chain and helps tackle import vulnerability concerns. Furthermore, those projects can bring additional benefits in terms of skills development and competitiveness as well as support the Union decarbonisation goals through implementing circular and sustainable manufacturing practices. In light of any such additional benefits, those projects should be selected as strategic projects by the Member States and should benefit from a framework allowing their speedier implementation, in particular through priority status and shorter time limits in the permit-granting process. Project promoters that wish to receive the status of a net-zero strategic project need to formally apply for such a status to the relevant Member State in accordance with the application and recognition criteria laid down in this Regulation.</p>

However, to ensure that permit-granting processes for net-zero technology manufacturing projects are predictable and timely, any potential to streamline the required assessments and authorisations should be realised, while not lowering the level of environmental protection. In that regard, the necessary assessments should be bundled to prevent unnecessary overlap and project promoters and the relevant authorities should explicitly agree on the scope of the bundled assessment before the assessment is carried out to prevent unnecessary follow-up.</p>

Clustering can contribute substantially to achieving the objectives of this Regulation. In that regard, this Regulation promotes the development of net-zero Acceleration Valleys (the ‘Valleys’). The objectives of Valleys are to create clusters of net-zero industrial activity in order to increase the attractiveness of the Union as a location for manufacturing activities and to further streamline the administrative procedures for setting up net-zero manufacturing capacities. Valleys should be limited in geographical and technology scope in order to promote industrial symbiosis. When defining the scope, Member States should take into account the need to favour multiple uses of the areas identified to ensure the expansion, reindustrialisation or creation of the Union’s net-zero technology industrial clusters and the availability of relevant transport and network infrastructure, storage and other flexibility tools. Setting up Valleys should correspond to any planned or existing project pipeline and the potential to access or organise education and training opportunities to ensure the availability of skilled labour. Valleys should be designated by Member States and each designation should be accompanied by a plan setting out concrete national measures to increase the attractiveness of the Valley as a location for manufacturing activities. Valleys should, in particular, be used as a tool for strengthening net-zero industrial activities in regions, taking into account the just transition and its objectives, in particular in coal regions in transition.</p>

When designating a Valley, Member States should draw up a plan specifying which net-zero manufacturing activity is to be covered in the Valley (the ‘Plan’). Member States should also conduct environmental impact assessments as required for the net-zero manufacturing activities that are to take place in the Valley. Such impact assessments substantially limit the need for undertakings to perform those assessments for permits for the net-zero manufacturing activities within the scope of the Valley. The Plan should include the results of the environmental impact assessments as well as the national measures to be taken to minimise or mitigate any negative environmental impact. The Plan should also include concrete national measures to support industrial activity within the scope of the Valley. Those measures should include measures to invest in or trigger private investment in energy, digital and transport infrastructure, as well as measures to reduce the operational expenditure for the industry in the Valley, such as contracts of difference for energy prices. Other measures to be considered include those strengthening intellectual property protection, to set up an innovation hub in the Valley and to attract start-ups to the Valley. In order to provide investment security for Union industry, the Plan should also specify the duration of the support measures.</p>

Furthermore, Member States should consider policy innovation in that field. Moreover, net-zero strategic projects should be regarded as urgent at national level and should therefore be given a priority status insofar as and to the extent that national law provides for such urgency procedures in all judicial and dispute resolution procedures relating to them, while ensuring respect for the rights of defence, if and to the extent, national law provides for such urgency procedures.

It encompasses three complementary and mutually reinforcing concepts: first, a more ‘circular’ energy system, with energy efficiency at its core; second, a greater direct electrification of end-use sectors; third, the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels, including hydrogen. Considerations related to energy system integration refer to solutions for fully integrating all the electricity generated by renewable energy installations into the wider energy system. That includes adopting technical solutions that allow for the integration of surplus electricity generated by renewable electricity installations, including through storage and by expanding plannable fossil free power sources in the grid, in its various forms and demand-side management.</p>

This initial deployment will also support further CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> storage in a 2050 perspective.

When this Regulation is incorporated into the European Economic Area Agreement, the Union target of 50 million tonnes of annual operational CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> injection capacity by 2030 will be adjusted accordingly. To ensure the achievement of the Union’s target, Member States should take the necessary measures to facilitate and incentivise the deployment of CCS projects. Such measures should also include measures incentivising emitters to capture emissions and investment support for investors for CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> transport infrastructures to transport CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> to the storage sites.</p>

An increasing volume of depleting gas and oil fields that could be converted into safe CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> storage sites are at the end of their useful production lifetime. In addition, the oil and gas industry has affirmed its determination to embark on an energy transition and possesses the assets, skills and knowledge needed to explore and develop additional storage sites. To reach the Union’s target of 50 million tonnes of annual operational CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> injection capacity by 2030, the sector needs to pool its contributions to ensure that CCS as a climate solution is available ahead of demand. In order to ensure a timely, Union-wide and cost-effective development of CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> storage sites in line with the Union objective for injection capacity, licensees of oil and gas production in the Union should contribute to that target on a pro rata basis of their oil and gas manufacturing capacity, while providing flexibilities to cooperate and take into account other contributions of third parties. A value-chain approach should be fostered by actions taken both at Union and national level. Accordingly, licensees of oil and gas production in the Union should undertake the necessary investments and support the development of viable business models for the entire carbon dioxide value chain.</p>

If the Commission has determined that the proportion of a net-zero technology or its main specific components originating in a third country accounts for more than 50 % of the supply of that specific technology or of those components within the Union, contracting authorities and contracting entities should be obliged to include several conditions in their procurement documents in order to achieve a resilient outcome. In that way, the value of the specific net-zero technology or the main specific components of the specific net-zero technology originating from the third country concerned should not exceed a 50 % limit under specific conditions. Moreover, if the Commission has determined that the proportion of supply within the Union of those products or components originating in a third country has increased by at least 10 percentage points on average for two consecutive years and has reached at least 40 % of the supply within the Union, the same mechanism should apply. This will allow the Union to take into account evolving dependencies in an efficient manner. For contracts covered by the Union’s Appendix I to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) or by other relevant international agreements by which the Union is bound, contracting authorities and contracting entities should not apply those requirements to net-zero technologies or their main specific components originating from sources of supply that are signatories to those agreements.</p>

Under the solar rooftop initiative announced in the Commission communication of 18 May 2022, Member States should for instance set-up national programmes to support the massive deployment of rooftop solar energy. In the REPowerEU plan, the Commission called Member States to make full use of supporting measures which encourage switching to heat pumps. Such support schemes set up nationally by Member States or locally by local or regional authorities should also contribute to improving the sustainability and resilience of the Union’s net-zero technologies. Public authorities should for instance provide higher financial compensation to beneficiaries for the purchase of net-zero technology final products that will make a higher contribution to resilience in the Union. Public authorities can make the eligibility of schemes conditional on the sustainability and resilience contribution. In doing so, Member States are encouraged to take into account the accessibility of the scheme for citizens living in energy poverty. Public authorities should ensure that their schemes are open, transparent and non-discriminatory, so that they contribute to increase demand for net-zero technology products in the Union. Public authorities should also limit the additional financial compensation for such products so as not to slow down the deployment of net-zero technologies in the Union. To increase the efficiency of such schemes, Member States should ensure that information is easily accessible both for consumers and for net-zero technology manufacturers on a free website. The use by public authorities of the sustainability and resilience contribution in schemes targeted at consumers or households should be without prejudice to State aid rules and to WTO rules on subsidies.</p>

The Net-Zero Europe Platform (the ‘Platform’) should also play an important role in accelerating the implementation of the sustainability and resilience contribution by Member States and public authorities in their practices relating to public procurement procedures and auctioning. The Commission should, after consulting the Platform, adopt an implementing act specifying the criteria to assess the sustainability and resilience contribution. That act should give particular attention to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which should have a fair chance to participate in the substantial market for public procurement. It should also ensure that the requirements with regard to sustainability and resilience are applied in a way that ensures fair and equal competition among market players regardless of their ownership structure.</p>

Therefore, where necessary and appropriate, justified limitations should be set on the proportion of products in supply contracts sourced from third countries if the Commission has determined that the conditions linked to resilience laid down in this Regulation are fulfilled. Furthermore, efforts should be undertaken to effectively tackle unfair subsidies from third countries that undermine the level playing field, for example by using all possible measures provided for in Regulations (EU) 2022/1031 <a id="ntc34-L_202401735EN.000101-E0034" href="#ntr34-L_202401735EN.000101-E0034"

                           <p class="oj-normal">Access to public and private finance is key for ensuring the Union’s open strategic autonomy and for establishing a solid and competitive manufacturing base for net-zero technologies and their supply chains across the Union. The majority of investments necessary to reach the European Green Deal objectives will come from private capital, attracted by both the growth potential of the net-zero ecosystem and a stable and ambitious policy framework. Well-functioning, deep and integrated capital markets will therefore be essential to raise and channel the funds necessary for the green transition and net-zero technology manufacturing projects. Swift progress towards the Capital Markets Union is thus necessary for the Union to deliver on its net-zero objectives. The sustainable finance agenda (and blended finance) also plays a crucial role in scaling up investments into the net-zero technologies along the value chains, while guaranteeing the competitiveness of the sector. As indicated in the Staff Working Document accompanying this Regulation, investment needs amount to around EUR 92 billion over the period 2023 to 2030, with a range of between about EUR 52 to 119 billion depending on various scenarios, which would result in public funding requirements of EUR 16 to 18 billion. Considering that this assessment only takes into account six specific technologies, the real investment need is likely to be significantly higher.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Private investment by companies and financial investors is essential. Where private investment alone is not sufficient, the effective roll-out of net-zero technology manufacturing projects might require public support, for example in the form of guarantees, loans or equity and quasi-equity investments, while avoiding distortion within the internal market. When that public support comes in the form of State aid, such aid should have an incentive effect and be necessary, targeted, temporary, appropriate and proportionate, while preserving competition and cohesion in the internal market. The existing State aid guidelines that have recently undergone an in-depth revision in line with the twin transition objectives, provide ample possibilities to support investments for projects within the scope of this Regulation subject to certain conditions. Member States can have an important role in easing access to finance for net-zero technology manufacturing projects by addressing market failures through targeted and temporary State aid support. The Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework adopted on 9 March 2023 aims to ensure a level playing field within the internal market that is targeted to those sectors where a third-country delocalisation risk has been identified and that is proportionate in terms of aid amounts. It enables Member States to put in place measures to support new investments in production facilities in defined, net-zero sectors, including via tax benefits. The permitted aid amount can be modulated with higher aid intensities and aid amount ceilings if the investment is located in assisted areas, in order to contribute to the goal of convergence between Member States and regions. In order to avoid fragmentation of the internal market, appropriate conditions are required to verify the concrete risks of diversion of the investment outside the EEA and that there is no risk of relocation within the EEA. To mobilise national resources for that purpose, Member States are encouraged to spend, in accordance with Article 10(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC, 25 % of ETS revenues that Member States collect annually from ETS auctions.</p>

Innovation needs to be enabled through experimentation spaces as scientific outcomes need to be tested in a controlled real-word environment. Net-zero regulatory sandboxes should be introduced to test innovative net-zero technologies or other innovative technologies with the potential to enable the transition to a climate neutral and clean economy and to reduce strategic dependencies, in a controlled real-world environment for a limited amount of time, thus enhancing regulatory learning and potential scaling up and wider deployment. It is appropriate to strike a balance between legal certainty for participants in the net-zero regulatory sandboxes and the achievement of the objectives of Union law. Member States should be able to provide for derogations of net-zero regulatory sandboxes in national law while ensuring compliance with Union law and with the essential requirements on net-zero technology laid down in national law. The Commission published a Guidance for Sandboxes document in 2023 as announced in the New European Innovation Agenda to support Member States in preparing the net-zero regulatory sandboxes. Those innovative technologies could eventually be essential to achieve the Union’s climate neutrality objective and to ensure the security of supply and resilience of the Union’s energy system.</p>

It aims to promote a unified approach towards achieving Europe’s decarbonisation goals, supporting European net-zero technologies, and building a sustainable and resilient energy future. The SET Plan has had a structuring effect on joint Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) actions, helping them deliver on common energy research and technology objectives with greater speed and effectiveness. The SET Plan has contributed to aligning the R&amp;I efforts and to leverage national public funding of participating countries to support jointly agreed R&amp;I priorities through the Clean Energy Transition Partnership and the Driving Urban Transition Partnership under Horizon Europe, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc46-L_202401735EN.000101-E0046" href="#ntr46-L_202401735EN.000101-E0046"

That implies important investment needs in re-skilling and upskilling, including in the field of vocational education and training.. The energy transition will require a significant increase in the number of skilled workers in a range of sectors, including renewable energy and energy storage and raw materials, and has a great potential for quality job creation. The skill needs for the fuel cell hydrogen sub-sector in manufacturing alone are estimated at 180 000 trained workers, technicians and engineers by the year 2030, according to the SET Plan. In the photo-voltaic solar energy sector, up to 66 000 jobs would be needed in manufacturing alone. It is therefore of utmost importance to make jobs in net-zero technologies attractive and accessible and to tackle the current mismatch between the skills of workers and the needs of companies.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Since strengthening the manufacturing capacity of key net-zero technologies in the Union will not be possible without a sizeable skilled workforce, it is necessary to introduce measures to boost the integration and activation of more people in the labour market, in particular women, young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), people with a migrant background, older persons and persons with disabilities Moreover, this should include workers from third countries as the Union attracts only a small share of qualified migrants. In line with the objectives of the Council Recommendation on ensuring a fair transition towards climate-neutrality, specific support for job-to-job transition for workers in redundant and declining sectors are important. This means investing in skills for all, while having a targeted approach towards vulnerable groups and regions in transition. The end objective should be the creation of quality jobs in the Union required for net-zero technologies in line with the targets for employment and training provided for in the Pillar, including fair and adequate wages, improving living and working conditions and ensuring safe and healthy workplaces as well as the right to quality life-long learning. Skills and labour shortages might also be the result of unattractive jobs and poor working conditions. Improving job quality in sectors and companies with poor working conditions is therefore an important element to attract workers. Building on and fully taking into account existing initiatives such as the EU Pact for Skills, activities at Union level with regard to skills intelligence and forecasting, such as those by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) and the European Labour Authority, and the Blueprints for sectoral cooperation on skills, the objective is to mobilise all actors to ensure relevance and increase the uptake of the training programmes, including Member States’ authorities, including at regional and local level, education and training providers, social partners and industry, in particular SMEs, as well as all types of universities, in order to identify skills needs, develop education and training programmes and deploy them at large scale in a fast and operational manner. Net-zero strategic projects have a key role to play in this regard. Member States and the Commission should ensure relevant financial support including by leveraging the possibilities of the Union budget through instruments such as the ESF +, InvestEU, Just Transition Fund, Horizon Europe, European Regional Development Funds, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the Modernisation Fund established pursuant to Article 10d of Directive 2003/87/EC, REPowerEU, the Single Market Programme and the STEP. The financial support should include seed-funding to be provided by the Commission to set up the European Net-Zero Industry Academies (the ‘Academies’) and to allow their functioning with a view to becoming financially sustainable three years after their establishment, including by receiving financial contributions from the private sector.</p>

Each Academy should develop an action plan setting out milestones and targets, including in terms of number of learners to be based on the assessment of skills shortages.</p>

To facilitate the work of Union institutions to keep the regulatory burden for net-zero technology industries at a minimum, this Regulation establishes a Net-Zero Regulatory Burden Scientific Advisory Group (the ‘Scientific Advisory Group’). The Scientific Advisory Group should develop science-based advice on the impact of the regulatory burden in the Union on net-zero industries, utilising a science-based methodology, and where appropriate taking into account the Better Regulation Toolbox, for the assessment of the impact of regulatory burdens. The work of the Scientific Advisory Group is without prejudice to the prerogatives of the Union’s institutions.</p>

However, currently there is not sufficient high quality data available to monitor those indicators. As the tasks provided for in this Regulation depend on the availability of quality data, it is necessary for the Commission to prioritise, in its monitoring, among the net-zero technologies on the basis of their importance in the Union while working on the improvement of the availability of such data. The Commission will also work closely with Eurostat, the statistical authority of the Union, to develop common codes for net-zero technologies necessary for high-quality, long-term reporting and statistics.</p>
