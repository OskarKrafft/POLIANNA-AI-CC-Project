That can have consequences on cross-border trade between Member States, thus creating obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market.

Ad-hoc measures taken by the Commission in order to re-establish the functioning of the internal market, based on the existing rules, were not sufficient. The Union was not sufficiently prepared to ensure efficient manufacturing, procurement and distribution of crisis-relevant non-medical goods, such as personal protective equipment. Measures to ensure the availability of crisis-relevant non-medical goods during the COVID-19 crisis were necessarily reactive. The COVID-19 crisis also revealed insufficient information sharing and an insufficient overview of manufacturing capacities across the Union, as well as vulnerabilities related to intra-Union and global supply chains.</p>

However, actions by the Commission were delayed by several weeks due to the lack of Union-wide contingency planning measures and a lack of clarity as to which national authority should be contacted to find rapid solutions to the impact of the crisis on the internal market. In addition, it became clear that uncoordinated restrictive actions taken by the Member States would further aggravate the impact of the crisis on the internal market. It emerged that there is a need for arrangements between the Member States and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as regards contingency planning, technical level coordination and cooperation, and information exchange. Additionally, it became clear that the lack of effective coordination between Member States exacerbated the shortages of goods and created more obstacles to the free movement of services and persons.</p>

That was due, inter alia, to a lack of transparency from authorities of the Member States, to economic operators not knowing where to obtain such information, to language constraints and to the administrative burden implied in making repeated inquiries in all Member States, especially in a constantly changing regulatory environment. That lack of information prevented economic operators from making informed business decisions regarding the extent to which they could exercise their right to free movement or continue cross-border business operations during that crisis. It is necessary to improve the availability of information regarding national and Union-level restrictions on free movement and crisis response measures.</p>

Other crises which might require a quicker response to prevent barriers to free movement in the internal market and to avoid severe disruptions to supply chains that are indispensable in the maintenance of activities in the internal market include, for example, forest fires, earthquakes or large-scale cyber attacks. The fact that such crises constitute exceptional and sudden events of extraordinary nature and scale implies that such events are reasonably unexpected. As it is not known what kind of crises could arise next and have a severe impact on the internal market and its supply chains in the future, it is necessary to provide for an instrument that would apply in the event of a wide range of crises having an impact on the internal market.</p>

It can give rise to obstacles to free movement or it can cause disruptions to supply chains. Disruptions to supply chains can exacerbate shortages of goods and services in the internal market and hinder production, which leads to additional barriers to trade and to the distortion of competition between Member States and between private operators, thereby disrupting the proper functioning of the internal market. Disruptions to supply chains can also lead to the emergence or likely emergence of diverging national measures to address those supply chain issues, leading to the activation of an internal market emergency mode. This Regulation should address these types of impacts on the internal market and introduce measures to avoid obstacles to free movement or supply chain disruptions that create shortages of crisis-relevant goods or services.</p>

Those detailed arrangements, taking the form of a contingency framework, should set out the specific technical and operational aspects of the mechanisms for exchanging information between the Commission and the Member States. Furthermore, it should lay down arrangements for operational coordination between the Commission and the Member States regarding crisis communication. In this context, a dedicated inventory of all the competent authorities of the respective Member States involved in the implementation of the framework laid down by this Regulation should be set up on the basis of the information communicated by the Member States. That inventory should indicate, in particular, the roles and responsibilities assigned to the competent authorities of their respective Member States during the internal market vigilance and emergency modes in accordance with national law. The arrangements between the Commission and the Member States should also cover the secure exchange of information concerning consultation of the economic operators and social partners with respect to their respective initiatives and actions to mitigate and respond to the effects of a potential crisis.</p>

In this context, the Commission should facilitate and encourage the development of strategies for emergency preparedness, including strategies for crisis communication and exchanging information about applicable restrictions in challenging circumstances. The identification of the specific focus sectors should be based on existing indicator-based tools which monitor the development of supply chains in the Union with a view to identifying potential distress, taking into account relevant specific criteria such as trade flows, demand and supply, concentration of supply, Union and global production and production capacities at different stages of the value chain and the interdependencies between economic operators.</p>

The Council implementing act for the activation of the internal market vigilance mode should contain elements which are intrinsically linked to the assessment of the fulfilment of the preconditions justifying the activation, namely an assessment of the potential impact of the relevant crisis on the free movement of goods, services and persons, including workers, in the internal market and on its supply chains, a list of the goods and services of critical importance which are indispensable to the maintenance of vital societal functions or economic activities in the internal market and the vigilance measures to be taken. Furthermore, where the activation of the internal market emergency mode also requires the adoption of a list of crisis-relevant goods or of crisis-relevant services, or of both, that list should be adopted at the same time as the internal market emergency mode is activated and should therefore be intrinsically linked to that activation. For that reason, implementing powers should also be conferred on the Council for the adoption of that list of crisis-relevant goods or crisis-relevant services and any update thereto. It should be possible to extend the internal market vigilance mode or internal market emergency mode through a Council implementing act on a proposal from the Commission. If it transpires that there is no need for either of the modes to be active, then the respective mode should be deactivated.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To ensure that the Board receives appropriate information about a potential internal market emergency, it is necessary to provide for monitoring. Such monitoring should concern supply chains of goods and services of critical importance for which the internal market vigilance mode has been activated and the free movement of persons who are involved in the production and supply of such goods and services. Monitoring of the supply chains of goods and services of critical importance should be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States on the basis of requests for the voluntary provision of information about factors impacting the availability of the selected goods and services of critical importance, such as production capacity, availability of the necessary workforce, stocks, suppliers’ limitations, possibilities for diversification and substitution, demand conditions and bottlenecks. The request for the voluntary provision of information in the context of such monitoring should be addressed to all actors along the relevant supply chain of goods and services of critical importance and other relevant stakeholders established in the territory of the Member States. Collecting information about disruptions to free movement from the relevant economic operators along the supply chains of goods and services of critical importance is particularly important because the lack of an appropriate workforce is one of the prevailing causes of disruptions to supply chains. The monitoring, by authorities of the Member States, of disruptions to the free movement of persons involved in the production and supply of goods and services should be understood broadly, covering workers, service providers, business representatives and other persons involved in research, development and placing goods on the market. Competent authorities of the Member States should provide the information gathered to the Commission and the Board via the central liaison offices. That information should enable the Board to advise the Commission on the necessity of activation of the internal market emergency mode.</p>

In addition, any such measures should adequately take into account the situation of border regions and outermost regions, especially for cross-border workers. Member States should remove measures taken to respond to an internal market emergency that restrict free movement as soon as they are no longer necessary. In general, national measures restricting free movement which are not harmonised under this Regulation would be in principle no longer justified or proportionate when the internal market emergency mode is deactivated and should therefore be removed.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">This Regulation lays down obligations with a view to ensuring transparency in relation to national measures adopted during an internal market emergency mode that restrict the right to free movement of persons. Any such restrictions should comply with Union law, in particular Directive 2004/38/EC. Those obligations should be without prejudice to any existing information or notification obligations that continue to apply. The free movement of persons is of paramount importance for the proper functioning of the internal market. Experience from the COVID-19 crisis shows that restrictions to that right to free movement can have spill-over effects on all other fundamental freedoms. Lack of information on crisis-related restrictions to the free movement of persons can cause Union citizens and economic operators additional difficulties in managing their activities during a crisis. Currently, there is no applicable transparency system in force that could provide Union citizens and economic operators with information on restrictions to the free movement of persons. Member States should communicate to the Commission and to other Member States the text of the national legislative or regulatory provisions introducing restrictions on the exercise of the right to free movement of persons in response to a crisis, as well as the modifications thereof, without delay after their adoption. That text should be accompanied by the reasons for such measures, including reasons demonstrating that the measures are justified and proportionate, as well as any underlying scientific or other data supporting their adoption, the scope of such measures, the dates of adoption and application, and the duration of those measures. To ensure that Union citizens and economic operators can obtain reliable information regarding restrictions to free movement, Member States should provide the public with clear, comprehensive and timely information explaining such measures, in particular their scope, date of adoption and application and duration, as soon as possible. That information should also be provided to the Commission. On that basis, the Commission should publish the relevant information on a dedicated website available in all official languages of the institutions of the Union.</p>

Such information requests should, where appropriate, concern: production capacities and stocks of crisis-relevant goods in production facilities located both in the Union and in countries outside the Union which those economic operators operate, contract with or purchase supplies from; the schedule or an estimation of the expected production output for the following three months for each production facility located in the Union and in countries outside the Union which those economic operators operate or contract with; and details of any relevant disruptions to or shortages in supply chains. To ensure full involvement of the Member State where the economic operator has its production facility, the Commission should forward, without delay, a copy of the information request to that Member State and, if the competent authority of that Member State so requests, the Commission should share the information it has acquired with that Member State through secure means.</p>

When making a request for information by means of an implementing act, the Commission should ensure that the benefit for the public interest outweighs the possible inconveniences that the economic operators concerned may sustain. The Commission should take into consideration the burden that such a request for information could represent, in particular for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and should set the time limit for reply accordingly. When the processing of a request for information by an economic operator has the potential to significantly disrupt its operations, that economic operator should be allowed to refuse to supply the information requested. The economic operator should be obliged to provide to the Commission the reasons for any refusal to supply the information requested. Such reasons should include, in particular, the risk of liability for breach of contractual non-disclosure obligations based on contracts governed by the law of a country outside the Union or the risk of disclosing information related to national security in the case of goods with possible uses in the context of national security, which could include national reserves.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The activation of the internal market emergency mode, where needed, should also enable the triggering of the application of certain crisis response procedures which introduce adjustments to the rules governing the design, manufacture, conformity assessment and the placing on the market of goods subject to Union harmonised rules as well as to certain rules governing the goods subject to the Union’s general product safety framework. Those crisis response procedures should enable products designated as crisis-relevant goods to be placed swiftly on the market in an emergency context. In the case of harmonised products, the conformity assessment bodies should prioritise the conformity assessment of crisis-relevant goods over any other ongoing applications for other products. Where there are undue delays in the conformity assessment procedures of crisis-relevant goods, the competent authorities of the Member States should be able to issue authorisations for such goods which have not undergone the applicable conformity assessment procedures to be placed on their respective market, provided that they comply with the applicable safety requirements. Such authorisations should be valid only in the territory of the issuing Member State until their validity is extended to the territory of the Union by means of a Commission implementing act. The validity of such authorisations that derogate from conformity assessment procedures should be limited to the duration of the internal market emergency mode. In addition, with a view to facilitating the increase in supply of harmonised and non-harmonised crisis-relevant goods, certain flexibilities should be introduced with respect to the mechanisms of presumption of conformity and presumption of conformity with the general safety requirement, respectively. In the context of an internal market emergency, the manufacturers of crisis-relevant goods should also be able to rely on national and international standards which provide an equivalent level of protection to the European standards the references of which have been published in the <span class="oj-italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>. With respect to the harmonised crisis-relevant goods alone, in cases where such European standards do not exist or compliance with them is rendered excessively difficult as a result of the disruptions to the internal market, the Commission should be able to issue common specifications providing a presumption of conformity in order to provide ready-to-use technical solutions to the manufacturers.</p>

Where such an exclusivity clause is provided for, it should stipulate that, where Member States have additional procurement needs and such procurement does not undermine the ongoing joint procurement or procurement on behalf of or in the name of the Member States according to the assessment of the Commission, it is possible for the participating Member States to launch their own procurement procedure. For the purposes of the joint procurement, EFTA States and Union candidate countries, as well as the Principality of Andorra, the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of San Marino and the Vatican City State should be considered participating Member States in case they decide to participate in the joint procurement. The purpose of the exclusivity clause is to ensure that the ongoing joint procurement or procurement on behalf of or in the name of the Member States is not undermined. De minimis procurement does not affect such procurement, and therefore Member States’ contracting authorities and contracting entities should be permitted to launch a procurement procedure which falls below the thresholds of Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU. In addition, given that procurement from an economic operator that is not participating in the ongoing tender does not undermine the ongoing procurement, the exclusivity clause laid down in this Regulation should not apply to that kind of procurement. Where a Member State decides to participate in joint procurement or procurement on behalf of or in the name of Member States for acquiring crisis-relevant goods and services, it should be able to use the central liaison offices provided for in this Regulation to inform all contracting authorities and contracting entities in its territory of the ongoing procurement that triggers the application of the exclusivity clause.</p>
