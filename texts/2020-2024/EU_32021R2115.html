The CAP should be based on delivery of performance (‘the delivery model’). Therefore, the Union should set the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the CAP and its basic requirements, while Member States should bear greater responsibility as to how they meet those objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs and the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions, tailoring the support to maximise the contribution to the achievement of Union objectives.</p>

Member States should determine in their CAP Strategic Plans, on the basis of objective conditions, which farmers are considered to be active farmers. To reduce the administrative burden, Member States should be allowed to grant direct payments to smaller farmers who also contribute to the vitality of rural areas and to establish a negative list of non-agricultural activities compared to which the agricultural activities are typically marginal. The negative list should not be the only way in which the definition is determined but should be used as a complementary tool to help to identify such non-agricultural activities, without prejudice for the persons concerned to prove that they fulfil the criteria of the definition of ‘active farmer’. To ensure a better income, strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas or pursue related objectives, the definition of ‘active farmer’ should not preclude the granting of support to pluri-active or part-time farmers who in addition to farming are also engaged in non-agricultural activities.</p>

Energy production and use supported through the CAP should concern energy which clearly displays the characteristics of sustainability, including as regards greenhouse gases. With regard to the management of natural resources, a lower dependence on chemicals such as artificial fertilisers and pesticides may be particularly helpful including for the protection of biodiversity, where lower dependence on pesticides and action to halt and reverse the decline of pollinator populations is needed in a timely manner in many parts of the Union.</p>

Member States should be required to assess the situation of women in farming and address challenges in their CAP Strategic Plans. Gender equality should be an integral part of the preparation, implementation and evaluation of CAP interventions.

The framework needs to be enhanced to take into account in particular the practices set until the year 2022 under the greening of direct payments, the mitigation of climate change and the need to improve farms’ sustainability and their contribution to biodiversity. It is acknowledged that each GAEC standard contributes to achieving multiple objectives. In order to implement the framework, Member States should set a national standard for each of the standards set at Union level, taking into account the specific characteristics of the area concerned, including soil and climatic conditions, existing farming conditions, farming practices, farm size and farm structures, land use, and the specificities of outermost regions. Member States should be able to set other national standards related to the main objectives of the GAEC standards in order to improve the environmental and climate delivery of the framework of the GAEC standards. Given the existing practices under organic farming system, no further requirement should be imposed on organic farmers as regards crop rotation. In addition, as regards the standards on crop rotation and on minimum share of arable land for biodiversity, Member States should be able to consider certain exceptions to avoid excessive burden on smaller farms or to exclude some farms that already fulfil the objective of the GAEC standards as they are covered to a significant extent by grassland, land lying fallow or leguminous crops. An exception should also be provided for the biodiversity requirement of minimum share of arable land in the case of predominantly forested Member States.</p>

Farm advisory services should help farmers and other beneficiaries of CAP support to become more aware of the relationship between farm management and land management on the one hand, and certain standards, requirements and information, including environmental and climate ones, on the other hand. The list of the latter includes standards applying to, or necessary for, farmers and other CAP beneficiaries, including cooperatives, and set in the CAP Strategic Plan, as well as those stemming from the legislation on water, on the sustainable use of pesticides, on nutrient management as well as on the initiatives to combat antimicrobial resistance. Advice should also be available on the management of risks and innovation support for preparing and implementing emerging EIP operational group projects, whilst capturing and making use of grassroot innovative ideas. In order to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the advice, Member States should integrate all public and private advisors and advisory networks within the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS), in order to be able to deliver up-to-date technological and scientific information developed by research and innovation.</p>

Such investments may concern, inter alia, infrastructures related to the development, modernisation or adaptation to climate change of agriculture and forestry, including access to farm and forest land, land consolidation and improvement, agro-forestry practices and the supply and saving of energy and water. It may also cover investments in the restoration of agricultural or forestry potential following natural disasters, adverse climatic events or catastrophic events, including fires, storms, floods, pests and diseases. In order to better ensure the consistency of the CAP Strategic Plans with Union objectives, as well as a level playing field between Member States, a negative list of investment topics should be included in this Regulation. Member States should make the best use of the available funds for investments by aligning support for investments with the relevant Union rules in the areas of environment and animal welfare.</p>
