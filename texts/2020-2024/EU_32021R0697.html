Moreover, the Commission committed itself to supporting the creation of a more integrated defence market in the Union and fostering the uptake of European defence products and technologies in the internal market, thus increasing the non-dependency on non-Union sources. The Commission proposed in particular to launch a European Defence Fund to support investments in joint research and the joint development of defence products and technologies, thereby fostering synergies and cost-effectiveness, and to promote the Member States’ joint purchase and maintenance of defence equipment. The European Defence Fund should complement national funding already used for that purpose, act as an incentive for Member States to cooperate and invest more in defence and support cooperation during the whole life cycle of defence products and technologies.</p>

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">5</span>)</a> on the basis of an integrated approach. The aim of the Fund is to enhance the competitiveness, innovation, efficiency and technological autonomy of the Union’s defence industry, thereby contributing to the Union’s strategic autonomy by supporting the cross-border cooperation between Member States as well as cooperation between enterprises, research centres, national administrations, international organisations and universities throughout the Union, both in the research and in the development phases of defence products and technologies. To achieve more innovative solutions and to foster an open internal market, the Fund should support and facilitate the widening of cross-border cooperation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and middle capitalisation companies (mid-caps) in the defence sector. Within the Union, common defence capability shortfalls are identified within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy, in particular through the Capability Development Plan (CDP), while the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) also identifies common defence research objectives.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Other Union processes such as the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) have the purpose of supporting the implementation of relevant priorities by identifying and taking up opportunities for enhanced cooperation with a view to fulfilling the Union’s level of ambition in the area of security and defence. Where appropriate, regional and international priorities, including those in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization context, may also be taken into account if they are in line with Union priorities and do not prevent any Member State or associated country from participating, while seeking to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>

The research phase may include significant risks, in particular in relation to the low level of maturity and the disruptive nature of technologies. The development phase, which usually follows the research phase, also entails significant risks and costs that hamper the further exploitation of the results of research and have an adverse impact on the competitiveness and innovation of the Union’s defence industry. The Fund should thus foster the link between the research and the development phases.</p>

The agreement on common technical specifications should be a prerequisite for actions involving a higher level of technological readiness. Activities leading to harmonised defence capability requirements as well as activities aiming to support the creation of a common definition of technical specifications or standards should also be eligible for support from the Fund, in particular where they foster interoperability.</p>

Industry therefore cannot undertake substantial self-funded defence R &amp; D projects, and Member States and associated countries often fully fund all R &amp; D costs. To achieve the objectives of the Fund, in particular to foster cooperation between legal entities from different Member States and associated countries, and taking into account the specificities of the defence sector, up to the totality of the eligible costs should be covered for actions that take place before the prototype phase.</p>

To ensure the credibility of their commitment, support from the Fund should, in normal cases, not exceed 20 % of the eligible costs.</p>
