It is therefore necessary to remove those obstacles. Such removal requires, first, that all trading venues and APAs (‘data contributors’) transmit data to CTPs, and, second, an improvement of the data quality by harmonising the data reports that data contributors are to submit to the data centres of CTPs.</p>

The inclusion of that requirement within the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU has left room for varying interpretations of that requirement, which has led to an uneven playing field between multilateral systems that are authorised as a regulated market, an MTF or an OTF and multilateral systems that are not authorised as such.

The use of both waivers is capped by the double volume cap, which is a mechanism that limits the level of dark trading to a certain proportion of total trading in an equity instrument. First, the level of dark trading in an equity instrument on an individual venue is not to exceed 4 % of the total volume of trading in that instrument in the Union. When that threshold is exceeded, dark trading in that instrument on that venue is suspended. Second, the level of dark trading in an equity instrument in the Union is not to exceed 8 % of the total volume of trading in that instrument in the Union. When that second threshold is exceeded, all dark trading under both waivers in that instrument is suspended. The first threshold, namely the venue-specific threshold, leaves room for the continued use of those waivers on other venues on which trading in that equity instrument is not yet suspended, until the second threshold, namely the Union-wide threshold, is exceeded. That makes monitoring the levels of dark trading and enforcing the suspension more complex. To simplify the double volume cap while keeping its effectiveness, the new single volume cap should rely solely on a Union-wide threshold set at 7 %, which should apply only to trading under the reference price waiver and not to trading under the negotiated trade waiver. ESMA should regularly assess the volume-cap threshold, taking into account financial stability considerations, international best practices, the competitiveness of Union firms, the significance of the market impact and the efficiency of price formation, and should submit a report with its suggestions to the Commission. On that basis, the Commission should be empowered to adjust the volume-cap threshold by means of delegated acts. ESMA should also assess the appropriateness of the volume cap and whether it is necessary to remove it or to extend it to other trading systems or execution venues which derive their prices from a reference price.</p>

The benefits of those requirements have been clear for such market operators and investment firms that operate a central limit order book or a periodic auction trading system, where bids and offers are anonymous, firm and truly multilateral. Other trading systems, in particular voice trading and request-for-quote systems, provide requestors with tailor-made quotes, which have marginal informational value to other market participants. To reduce the regulatory burden imposed on such market operators and investment firms and to simplify the applicable waivers, the requirement to publish firm or indicative quotes should apply only to central limit order books and periodic auction trading systems. In order to accommodate for limiting the pre-trade transparency to central limit order books and periodic auction trading systems, the requirements applicable to waivers as referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be amended. The waiver that is available above a size specific to the financial instrument for request-for-quote systems and for voice trading systems should be removed.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Currently, derivatives fall within the scope of the non-equity transparency regime, which combines different types of financial instruments with mostly securities (bonds) on the one hand and mostly contracts (derivatives) on the other. Transparency for non-equity instruments, as well as for equity instruments, relies on the concept of ‘traded on a trading venue’. For certain derivatives, that concept has proven to be problematic due to their lack of fungibility and the lack of appropriate identifying reference data. For that reason, the scope of derivatives transparency should rely not on the concept of ‘traded on a trading venue’, but, rather, on predefined characteristics of the derivatives. The derivatives should be subject to the transparency requirements regardless of whether they are traded on or off venue. The transparency requirements should apply to derivatives that are sufficiently standardised for the data published in relation to them to be meaningful for market participants beyond the contracting parties. This means that all exchange-traded derivatives should remain subject to the transparency requirements. Other derivatives should be subject to the transparency requirements where they fall within the scope of the clearing obligation under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc7-L_202400791EN.000101-E0007" href="#ntr7-L_202400791EN.000101-E0007"

This ensures that transactions that are considered to be unsuitable for the clearing obligation, such as intragroup transactions, are not subject to the transparency requirements. In particular, only interest rate derivatives with the most standardised and liquid currency and tenor combinations should fall within the scope of the transparency requirements. Furthermore, recent market events have shown that a lack of transparency in certain credit default swaps referencing global systemically important banks or referencing an index comprising such banks might fuel speculation on the creditworthiness of such banks. Such credit default swaps should therefore also be subject to the transparency requirements where they are centrally cleared even where they are not subject to the clearing obligation. The Commission should be empowered to amend the conditions for determining the derivatives that are to be subject to the transparency requirements where market developments so require.</p>

Article 11 of that Regulation specifies where it is possible for competent authorities to authorise the deferred publication of those details. Such deferred publication is allowed where a transaction is above the large-in-scale size threshold, is in an instrument for which there is no liquid market, or, where the transaction involves liquidity providers, is above the size specific to the financial instrument threshold. Competent authorities have discretion to determine the duration of the deferrals and the details of the transactions to be deferred. That discretion has led to differing practices among the Member States and to an ineffective and complex post-trade transparency regime. To ensure transparency with regard to all types of investors, it is necessary to harmonise the deferral regime at Union level, to remove discretion at national level and to facilitate data consolidation. It is therefore appropriate to reinforce post-trade transparency requirements by removing the discretion of competent authorities.</p>

The categories of transactions for which deferrals are allowed should be determined taking into account the size of the transactions and the liquidity of the financial instruments concerned.

For the purpose of having a more stable transparency regime, a static determination of liquidity for bonds, structured finance products and emission allowances, or classes thereof, is needed. The draft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA should specify which issuance sizes correspond to a liquid or illiquid market in bonds, or classes thereof, until their maturity, from which transaction size in either a liquid or illiquid bond a deferral can be applied, and the duration of such a deferral in accordance with this Regulation. In order to have an appropriate level of transparency for covered bonds, it is appropriate for the issuance size of such bonds to be determined in accordance with the criteria laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 <a id="ntc8-L_202400791EN.000101-E0008" href="#ntr8-L_202400791EN.000101-E0008"

That Article has, however, not delivered on its objectives. The information provided by trading venues, APAs and systematic internalisers on a reasonable commercial basis does not enable users to understand data policies and how the price for data is set. On 18 August 2021, ESMA issued guidelines explaining how the concept of ‘reasonable commercial basis’ should be applied. Those guidelines should be converted to legal obligations and strengthened in order to ensure that it is not possible for trading venues, APAs, CTPs and systematic internalisers to charge for data according to the value that the data represents to individual users. Due to the high level of detail required to specify the concept of ‘reasonable commercial basis’ and the required flexibility in amending the applicable rules on the basis of the fast-changing data landscape, ESMA should be empowered to develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying how the concept of ‘reasonable commercial basis’ is to be applied, thereby further strengthening the harmonised and consistent application of Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. Furthermore, ESMA should monitor and assess developments in data policies and price-setting in the market.

Systematic internalisers are free to decide at which sizes they quote, provided that they quote at a minimum size of 10 % of the standard market size. That possibility, however, has led to very low levels of pre-trade transparency provided by systematic internalisers in equity instruments, and has hampered the achievement of a level playing field. It is therefore necessary to require systematic internalisers to make public firm quotes on the basis of a minimum quote size to be determined by means of regulatory technical standards. When developing those regulatory technical standards, it is appropriate for ESMA to consider the following objectives: increasing the pre-trade transparency of equity instruments for the benefit of end-investors; maintaining a level playing field between trading venues and systematic internalisers; providing end investors with an adequate choice of trading options; and ensuring that the trading landscape in the Union remains attractive and competitive both domestically and internationally. In order to increase the competitiveness of systematic internalisers, they should be allowed to match orders of any size at midpoint.</p>

This has led many investment firms to opt in to the status of systematic internaliser in particular for the purpose of reporting trades for their clients while not dealing on own account on a systematic basis, which has placed disproportionate requirements on such investment firms. Therefore, it is appropriate to introduce a status of designated publishing entity allowing an investment firm to be responsible for making a transaction public through an APA without the need to opt in to the status of systematic internaliser. Furthermore, competent authorities should grant investment firms the status of designated publishing entity for specific classes of financial instrument, in line with the request of those investment firms and should communicate such requests to ESMA. ESMA should maintain a public register of such designated publishing entities by class of financial instrument so that market participants can identify them.</p>

That obstacle should be removed to enable CTPs to obtain the data and to overcome licensing issues. Data contributors should be required to submit their data to CTPs and to use a harmonised format meeting standards that ensure high-quality data when so doing. Data contributors should also provide regulatory data to keep investors informed of the status of the system matching orders, for example in the event of a market outage, and of the status of the financial instrument, for example in the event of suspensions or trading halts. Only CTPs selected and authorised by ESMA should be able to collect data from data contributors in accordance with the mandatory contribution rule.

In order to avoid the negative impact the consolidated tape might have on small trading venues, even though their inclusion in the consolidated tape might have positive effects on their viability and the liquidity of the securities traded on those venues, an opt-in mechanism should be established. That opt-in mechanism should apply to investment firms operating SME growth markets and to market operators whose annual trading volume of shares represents 1 % or less of the annual trading volume of shares in the Union. Two alternative conditions should complement the 1 % threshold: either the investment firm or market operator is not part of a group comprising or having close links with an investment firm or a market operator that exceeds the 1 % threshold, or the concentration of the trading is very high in the venue operated by that investment firm or market operator, namely 85 % of the total annual trading volume of shares is traded in the trading venue where they were initially admitted to trading. Only a few trading venues fulfil those criteria, and therefore only a small percentage of trading in the Union would not be required to transmit data to the CTP. Nonetheless, the investment firms and market operators fulfilling those criteria would have the opportunity to opt in and should notify the CTP and ESMA of any decision to do so. Such a decision would be irrevocable and all the data – for both shares and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – would be part of the consolidated tape afterwards.</p>

Therefore the requirements for the quality and substance of data should, where necessary, be specified by means of regulatory technical standards and should take into account prevailing industry standards and practices, international developments and standards agreed at Union or international level as well as the advice of a dedicated expert stakeholder group, established by the Commission and tasked with providing advice on the quality and substance of data and the quality of the transmission protocol. ESMA should be closely involved in the work of the expert stakeholder group.</p>

To ensure that, in the context of the consolidation of data, timestamps reported by different entities can be compared meaningfully, it is appropriate to extend the requirements for harmonisation of the synchronisation of business clocks to designated publishing entities, systematic internalisers, APAs and CTPs. Due to the level of technical expertise required to specify the requirements for application of a synchronised business clock, ESMA should be empowered to develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the level of accuracy to which the business clocks should be synchronised.</p>

This requirement does not apply to trades in shares which are non-systematic, ad hoc, irregular and infrequent. It is currently not sufficiently clear when this exemption applies. ESMA has therefore clarified its scope by making a distinction between shares on the basis of their International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). According to that distinction, only shares with a European Economic Area (EEA) ISIN which are traded on a trading venue are subject to the share trading obligation. That approach provides clarity to market participants trading in shares. ESMA’s current practice should therefore be incorporated in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, while simultaneously removing the exemption for trades in shares which are non-systematic, ad hoc, irregular and infrequent.</p>

Furthermore, the transaction reporting should allow for a broad exchange of transaction data among competent authorities, in order to adequately reflect their evolving supervisory needs to monitor the most recent market developments and potential related risks.</p>

The concept of ‘traded on a trading venue’ has proven to be problematic in the case of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives for the purposes of transaction reporting, for the same reason it has proven to be problematic for the purposes of transparency requirements. Therefore, the new scope for transaction reporting of derivatives clarifies that transactions in OTC derivatives executed on venue are to be reported, and those transactions in OTC derivatives executed off venue are to be reported only if they are subject to transparency requirements or if the underlying is traded on a trading venue or is an index or basket composed of financial instruments that are traded on a trading venue.</p>

The identifier currently used for derivatives, namely the ISIN, has proved cumbersome and ineffective for public transparency, and that situation should be remedied by using identifying reference data based on a globally agreed unique product identifier, such as the ISO 4914 Unique Product Identifier (UPI). The UPI has been developed as an identification tool for OTC derivative products, with the intention to bring increased transparency and aggregation of data across the global OTC derivative markets. However, it is possible that that unique identifier is not sufficient and that it needs to be complemented by additional identifying data. Therefore, the Commission should specify, by means of delegated acts, the identifying reference data to be used with regard to OTC derivatives, including a unique identifier and any other relevant identifying reference data. In relation to the identifier to be used for the purposes of transaction reporting pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the Commission should specify the most appropriate identifiers of OTC derivatives, which might be different from the identifier determined for transparency requirements, taking into account the different purposes of those requirements, in particular as regards supervision of market abuse by competent authorities.</p>

The data that small trading venues contribute to the consolidated tape therefore play a more determining role in the price formation for the shares that small trading venues admit to trading. Notwithstanding the possibility of certain data contributors not to contribute to the consolidated tape, it is appropriate to grant, to those data contributors that decide to opt in to the consolidated tape, preferential treatment for the redistribution of revenue generated by the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs, to help small trading venues to maintain their local admissions and safeguard a rich and vibrant ecosystem in line with the objectives of the capital markets union.</p>

The weighting of those criteria should be specified by means of regulatory technical standards. In order to incentivise small trading venues to opt in to the mandatory contribution of data to the CTP for shares and ETFs, the highest weighting should apply to the total annual trading volume of small trading venues. The second highest weighting should remunerate data contributors that provided initial admission to trading of shares or ETFs on 27 March 2019 or thereafter. Considering the limited number of listings on small trading venues, the CTP should apply the relevant weighting on the total annual trading volume of such venues, whereas for other venues the CTP should apply it to the trading volume pertaining to the shares and ETFs that were initially admitted to trading on 27 March 2019 or thereafter. The lowest weighting of the three criteria should remunerate the trading that has been concluded on a trading system providing pre-trade transparency and that resulted from orders that were not subject to a waiver from pre-trade transparency.</p>

For CTPs that requirement prevents the commercial viability of a potential CTP, since certain potential clients could prefer waiting for the free core market data rather than becoming users of the consolidated tape. This is in particular the case for bonds and OTC derivatives, which are in general not traded frequently and for which the data have often kept most of their value after 15 minutes. Therefore, while the requirement to deliver trade reports free of charge after 15 minutes should remain in place for trading venues and APAs, it should be abandoned for CTPs to ensure their commercial viability.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Post-trade risk reduction services are an essential tool of risk management with respect to OTC derivatives. Post-trade risk reduction services rely on technical transactions that are pre-arranged, non-price-forming and market-risk neutral and that achieve a reduction in the risk in each of the portfolios. Portfolio compression services, which are currently exempt from the obligation to execute orders on terms most favourable to the client as laid down in Article 27 of Directive 2014/65/EU (‘best execution’) and transparency requirements, are a subset of post-trade risk reduction services. In light of their technical and non-price-forming nature, the transactions on OTC derivatives that are formed and established as a result of post-trade risk reduction services should not be subject to the derivative trading obligation. Taking into account the fact that providers of post-trade risk reduction services do not allow multiple third-party buying and selling trading interests in financial instruments to interact, they should not be considered to operate a multilateral system. They should similarly be exempt from requirements of pre- and post-trade transparency and of verifying best execution. The Commission should be empowered to specify, by means of delegated acts, what constitutes post-trade risk reduction services for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and the particulars of the transactions to be recorded.</p>

Such suspension might, however, prevent counterparties from being able to comply with their derivative trading obligation, because the clearing obligation is a pre-requisite to the derivative trading obligation. It is therefore necessary to lay down that, where the suspension of the clearing obligation would lead to a material change in the criteria for the derivative trading obligation, it should be possible to concurrently suspend the derivative trading obligation for the same classes of OTC derivative that are subject to the suspension of the clearing obligation. ESMA should also be able to request that the Commission suspend the derivative trading obligation, where such a suspension is necessary to avoid or address adverse effects on liquidity or a serious threat to financial stability and to ensure the orderly functioning of financial markets in the Union.</p>

Where such changes in market conditions are present, and upon the request of the competent authority of a Member State, the Commission should be able to suspend the derivative trading obligation independently from any suspension of the clearing obligation. Such a suspension of the derivative trading obligation should be possible where the activities of an EEA investment firm with a non-EEA counterparty are unduly affected by the scope of the derivative trading obligation and where that investment firm acts as a market maker in the category of derivatives subject to the derivative trading obligation. The issue of overlapping derivative trading obligations is particularly acute in the case of trading with counterparties within the jurisdiction of a third country that applies its own derivative trading obligations. That suspension would also help EEA financial counterparties to remain competitive on global markets. When deciding whether to suspend the derivative trading obligation, the Commission should take into account the impact of such a suspension on the clearing obligation.</p>

The application of the non-discriminatory access regime for exchange-traded derivatives, laid down in Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, might thus limit investment in such products by removing incentives for regulated markets to create new exchange-traded derivatives. It should therefore be laid down that that regime is not to apply to the central counterparty (CCP) or trading venue concerned in respect of exchange-traded derivatives, thus fostering innovation and the development of exchange-traded derivatives in the Union.</p>

To that end, financial intermediaries should select the trading venue or counterparty for executing their clients’ trades solely on the basis of achieving best execution for their clients. It should be incompatible with the principle of best execution that a financial intermediary, when acting on behalf of its retail clients or clients that have opted in to the professional client regime as referred to in Directive 2014/65/EU, receives a fee, a commission or a non-monetary benefit from any third party for executing orders from those clients on a particular execution venue or for forwarding orders of those clients to any third party for their execution on a particular execution venue. Investment firms should therefore be prohibited from receiving such payment. This prohibition is necessary in light of the divergent practices by competent authorities across the Union in their application and supervision of the best-execution requirement as laid down in Article 27 of Directive 2014/65/EU. It should be possible for a Member State in which investment firms carried out such an activity before 28 March 2024 to exempt investment firms under its jurisdiction from that prohibition until 30 June 2026, where those investment firms provide such services to clients domiciled or established in that Member State.</p>
