The Union’s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. Therefore, for the Union to remain a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, it is crucial that it encourages scientific and technical progress and supports the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), start-ups and innovative businesses.</p>

Historically, the space sector’s development has been linked to security. In many cases, the equipment, components and instruments used in the space sector, as well as space data and services, are dual-use. However, the Union’s security and defence policy is determined within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in accordance with Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).</p>

It is therefore essential that the Union supports autonomous, reliable and cost-effective access to space, especially as regards critical infrastructure and technology, public security and the security of the Union and its Member States. The Commission should therefore have the possibility to aggregate launch services at European level, both for its own needs and, at their request, for those of other entities, including Member States, in accordance with Article 189(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market, it is also crucial that the Union continues to have access to modern, efficient and flexible launch infrastructure facilities and benefits from appropriate launch systems. Therefore, without prejudice to measures taken by Member States or the European Space Agency (ESA), it should be possible for the Programme to support adaptations to the space ground infrastructure, including new developments, which are necessary for the implementation of the Programme and adaptations, including technology development, to space launch systems which are necessary for launching satellites, including alternative technologies and innovative systems, for the implementation of the Programme’s components.

The emergence of a business- and innovation-friendly model should be supported at European, regional and national levels by initiatives such as space hubs that bring together the space, digital and other sectors, as well as users. Those space hubs should aim to foster entrepreneurship and skills while pursuing synergies with the digital innovation hubs. The Union should foster the creation and expansion of Union-based space companies to help them succeed, including by supporting them in accessing risk finance in view of the lack of appropriate access within the Union to private equity for space start-ups and by fostering demand, known as the first contract approach.</p>

International cooperation is a key element of the Space Strategy for Europe, as set out by the Commission in its Communication of 26 October 2016. The Commission should use the Programme to contribute to and benefit from international efforts through initiatives, to promote European technology and industry internationally, for example bi-lateral dialogues, industry workshops and support for SME internationalisation, and to facilitate access to international markets and foster fair competition, also leveraging economic diplomacy initiatives. European space diplomacy initiatives should be in full coherence and complementarity with the existing Union policies, priorities and instruments, while the Union has a key role to play, together with Member States, in remaining at the forefront of the international scene.</p>

The appropriate instrument at Union level to finance those research and innovation activities is Horizon Europe. However, a very specific part of development activities should be financed from the budget allocated to the Galileo and EGNOS components under this Regulation, in particular where such activities concern fundamental elements such as Galileo-enabled chipsets and receivers, which would facilitate the development of applications across different sectors of the economy. Such financing should nevertheless not jeopardise the deployment or exploitation of the infrastructures established under the Programme.</p>

The reliance on such technologies results in uncertainty and risk for public contracts concluded under the Programme, insofar as those contracts involve long-term commitments to equipment or services. Specific measures concerning public contracts are therefore required in addition to the rules laid down in the Financial Regulation. It should thus be possible to award a contract in the form of a conditional stage-payment contract, introduce an amendment, under certain conditions, in the context of its performance, or impose a minimum level of subcontracting, particularly in order to enable SMEs and start-ups to participate. Finally, given the technological uncertainties that characterise the Programme’s components, contract prices cannot always be forecast accurately and it should therefore be possible to conclude contracts without stipulating a firm fixed price and to include clauses to safeguard the financial interests of the Union.</p>

However, they have been hindered by the ceiling on financial support imposed by the Financial Regulation.

That governance should be based on three key principles. Firstly, it is imperative that Member States’ extensive, unique experience in security matters be taken into consideration to the greatest possible extent. Secondly, in order to prevent conflicts of interest and any shortcomings in applying security rules, operational functions should be segregated from security accreditation functions. Thirdly, the entity in charge of managing all or part of the Programme’s components is also the best placed to manage the security of the tasks entrusted to it. The security of the Programme would build upon the experience gained in the implementation of Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus over the past years. Sound security governance also requires that roles be appropriately distributed among the various players. As it is responsible for the Programme, the Commission, without prejudice to Member States prerogatives in the area of national security, should determine the general security requirements applicable to each of the Programme’s components.</p>

It is therefore important to ensure the continuity of the infrastructure and services already in place, whilst adapting to the changing user needs, market environment, particularly the emergence of private actors in space and socio-political developments for which a rapid response is needed. That requires an evolution of the functional structure of Copernicus to better reflect the shift from the first stage of operational services to the provision of advanced and more targeted services to new user communities and the fostering of added-value downstream markets. To that end, its further implementation should adopt an approach following the data value chain, i.e. data acquisition, data and information processing, distribution and exploitation, user, market uptake and capacity building activities, while the strategic planning process under Horizon Europe would identify research and innovation activities that should make use of Copernicus.</p>

Activities under Copernicus should expand their global monitoring coverage over the polar regions and support environmental compliance assurance, statutory environmental monitoring and reporting and innovative environmental applications in agriculture, forest, water and marine resources management and cultural heritage, such as for crops monitoring, water management and enhanced fire monitoring. In doing so, Copernicus should leverage and take maximum advantage of the investments made under the previous funding period (2014-2020), including those made by Member States, ESA and EUMETSAT, while exploring new operational and business models to further complement the Copernicus capacities. Copernicus might also build on successful partnerships with Member States to further develop its security dimension under appropriate governance mechanisms, in order to respond to evolving user needs in the security domain.</p>

As SST services are user-driven, appropriate mechanisms should be put in place to collect user requirements, including those relating to security and the transmission of relevant information to and from public institutions to improve the effectiveness of the system, while respecting national safety and security policies.</p>

In that context, the Commission should procure GOVSATCOM capacities from Member States with national systems and space capacities and from commercial satellite communication or service providers, taking into account the essential security interests of the Union. In that first phase GOVSATCOM services would be introduced in a stepped approach. If in the course of the first phase a detailed analysis of future supply and demand reveals that this approach is insufficient to cover the evolving demand, it should be possible to take a decision to move to a second phase and develop additional bespoke space infrastructure or capacities through one or several public-private partnerships, e.g. with Union satellite operators.</p>
