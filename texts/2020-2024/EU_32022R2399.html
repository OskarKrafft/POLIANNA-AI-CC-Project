The lack of alignment between Union non-customs formalities and customs formalities leads to complex and burdensome reporting obligations for traders, inefficient goods clearance processes conducive to error and fraud, and additional costs for economic operators. The lack of interoperability of the systems used by those customs authorities and other authorities is a major obstacle to progress on completing the digital single market in respect of customs controls. To address the fragmented interoperability between customs authorities and partner competent authorities in the management of goods clearance processes and to coordinate action in this area, the Commission and the Member States have made a number of commitments over the years to develop single window initiatives for the clearance of goods.</p>

The rapid rise in international trade and e-commerce has increased the need for better cooperation and coordination among those authorities. The ongoing process of digitalisation allows this situation to be addressed more efficiently by connecting the systems of customs authorities and partner competent authorities and by enabling an integrated, accessible and systematic automated exchange of information between them, with the objective of strengthening cooperation on customs procedures. As such, the current framework of regulatory compliance is insufficient to support effective interaction between customs authorities and partner competent authorities, whose systems and procedures are characterised by fragmentation and redundancy. A fully coordinated and efficient goods clearance process requires a streamlined Union regulatory environment for international trade that delivers long-term benefits to the Union and its residents in all policy areas, supports the effectiveness and proper functioning of the internal market and ensures consumer protection.</p>

That project allows customs authorities to automatically verify compliance with a limited number of non-customs formalities, enabling information to be exchanged between the customs systems of participating Member States and the respective Union non-customs systems managing non-customs formalities. While the project has improved clearance procedures, its voluntary nature clearly limits its potential to generate substantial benefits for customs authorities, partner competent authorities and economic operators. The potential benefits of the project are limited in particular due to the absence of a comprehensive view of all imports to and exports from the Union and because it has limited effect in reducing the administrative burden for economic operators.</p>

Union non-customs formalities comprise all operations which are to be carried out by a natural person, an economic operator or a partner competent authority for the international movement of goods, including the part of the movement between Member States, when required. Those formalities impose different obligations for the import, export or transit of certain goods, and their verification through customs controls is fundamental to the effective functioning of the EU Single Window Environment for Customs. EU CSW-CERTEX should cover digitalised formalities laid down in Union legislation and managed by partner competent authorities in electronic Union non-customs systems, storing the relevant information from all Member States required for goods clearance. It is therefore appropriate to identify the Union non-customs formalities and the respective Union non-customs systems that should be subject to digital cooperation through EU CSW-CERTEX.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">In particular, the definition of Union non-customs systems should be broad and should encompass the different situations and legal formulations in the legal acts that enabled or will enable the creation and use of those systems. Moreover, it is also appropriate to specify the dates by which the specific Union non-customs system covering a Union non-customs formality and the national single window environments for customs should be interconnected to EU CSW-CERTEX. Those dates should reflect the dates established in Union legislation other than customs legislation for the fulfilment of the specific Union non-customs formality, in order to allow compliance through the EU Single Window Environment for Customs. In particular, EU CSW-CERTEX should initially cover sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, rules regulating the import of organic products, environmental requirements in relation to fluorinated greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, and formalities related to the import of cultural goods.</p>

In pursuit of those opportunities and priorities, several Member States have started to develop frameworks for national single window environments for customs. Those initiatives differ substantially depending on the level of existing customs information technology architecture, priorities and cost structures. It is therefore necessary to require Member States to establish and operate national single window environments for customs for Union non-customs formalities covered by EU CSW-CERTEX, with a minimum set of functionalities enabling all the data present in Union non-customs systems used by partner competent authorities to be exploited. Those national single window environments should constitute the national components of the EU Single Window Environment for Customs, enabling the exchange of information and cooperation by electronic means between customs authorities, partner competent authorities and economic operators to ensure compliance with and efficient enforcement of customs legislation and Union non-customs formalities covered by EU CSW-CERTEX.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">In line with that objective, the national single window environments for customs should enable the automated verification by customs authorities of formalities in respect of which data is transmitted from the Union non-customs system through EU CSW-CERTEX. The national single window environments for customs should also allow partner competent authorities to monitor and control the quantities of authorised goods (‘quantity management’) that have been released by customs authorities through the Union. This should be ensured by providing the necessary clearance information to the Union non-customs systems through EU CSW-CERTEX. In practical terms, quantity management at Union level is necessary to enable better enforcement of non-customs formalities by automatically and consistently monitoring the use of authorised quantities for the release of goods, avoiding their overuse or mishandling. The connection of the national single window environments for customs with EU CSW-CERTEX would facilitate efficient quantity management at Union level.</p>

The Union non-customs formalities subject to that additional facilitation measure are a subset of the overarching formalities covered by EU CSW-CERTEX. The Commission should identify those formalities progressively by assessing the fulfilment of a set of criteria relevant to trade facilitation, taking into account their legal and technical feasibility. In order to further enhance trade facilitation and improve the efficiency of controls, it should be possible to use the national single window environments for customs as a platform for coordinating controls between customs authorities and partner competent authorities in accordance with Article 47(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.</p>

In that context, interoperability means the capability to run such processes seamlessly across customs and non-customs systems and domains without losing the context or meaning of the data exchanged. To enable the fully automated verification of Union non-customs formalities, EU CSW-CERTEX should ensure technical interoperability and that the meaning of the relevant data is consistent. It is important to align customs and non-customs terminology to ensure that the data and information exchanged is preserved and understood throughout the exchanges between Union non-customs systems and national single window environments for customs. In addition, to ensure the harmonised enforcement of Union non-customs formalities across the Union, EU CSW-CERTEX should identify the customs procedure or the re-export for which the supporting document can be used based on the administrative decision indicated by the partner competent authority in the supporting document. From a technical perspective, EU CSW-CERTEX should make customs and non-customs data compatible by transforming their format or structure where necessary, without changing their content.</p>

It should make the relevant data available to customs authorities in order for them to better enforce Union non-customs regulatory policies through the automated verification of those formalities. It should also provide the relevant data to partner competent authorities in order for them to monitor and determine the remaining quantity of authorised goods not written off by customs in the clearance of other consignments. In addition, it should support the implementation of the ‘one-stop shop’ principle for the performance of controls referred to in Article 47(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, by facilitating the integration of customs and Union non-customs procedures for a fully automated goods clearance process.</p>

To the extent that Union law does not provide for that, Member States define the operational aspect of the cooperation between customs and non-customs authorities at national level. Thus, Member States are able to use all EU CSW-CERTEX functionalities for a fully automated fulfilment of formalities and any other automated data transfer between customs authorities and the relevant partner competent authorities required by Union legislation establishing Union non-customs formalities.</p>

This Regulation bridges the gaps between customs authorities and partner competent authorities, and provides a framework for digital collaboration which needs to be implemented across the Union. Therefore, in order to ensure appropriate planning and timelines, Member States are encouraged to carry out impact assessments on their national systems, processes and planning and to provide the necessary information, in a timely manner, to the Commission, with a view to promoting better law-making, in particular with regard to delegated acts and implementing acts, in accordance with the objectives of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making <a id="ntc12-L_2022317EN.01000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_2022317EN.01000101-E0012"

When amending the list of Union non-customs formalities covered by EU CSW-CERTEX, the Commission should also determine the dates when the respective Union non-customs systems and the national single window environments for customs should be connected with EU CSW-CERTEX, at the latest. Those dates should be established taking into consideration two elements: first, the dates by which certain obligations from Union legislation are to be fulfilled, in order to ensure that the EU Single Window Environment for Customs can be used for that purpose and, second, the deployment windows which are commonly used for customs systems.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Member States might connect certain Union non-customs systems and the national single window environment for customs with EU CSW-CERTEX earlier than the dates laid down in the Annex. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.</p>

This approach is in line with Article 3 of that Regulation, which entrusts customs authorities with the task of ensuring the security and safety of the Union and its residents in close cooperation with other authorities where appropriate, while facilitating trade. Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 should therefore be amended to include the EU Single Window Environment for Customs within the list of customs legislation therein. Article 163(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 stipulates that the supporting documents required for the application of the provisions governing the relevant customs procedure or the re-export are to be in the declarant’s possession and at the disposal of the customs authorities at the time when the customs declaration or re-export declaration is lodged. Since customs authorities will be able to obtain through EU CSW-CERTEX the necessary data associated with Union non-customs formalities, this obligation should be deemed to be fulfilled. Therefore, in order to better integrate customs and Union non-customs procedures, enabling them to run simultaneously, Article 163(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 should be amended accordingly.</p>

The timing needed to advance these developments at Union and national level should therefore be taken into consideration for the application of this Regulation. Furthermore, the implementation of additional digital cooperation measures is expected to take substantially longer, as it requires prior identification of the Union non-customs formalities concerned together with the relevant technical developments.
