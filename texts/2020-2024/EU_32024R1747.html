The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has also caused uncertainty on the supply of other commodities, such as hard coal and crude oil, used by power-generating installations. That uncertainty has resulted in a substantial additional increase in the volatility of electricity prices. The reduced availability of several nuclear reactors and the low hydropower output have further amplified the increase in electricity prices.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Strengthening the internal energy market and achieving the climate and energy transition objectives require a substantial upgrade of the Union’s electricity network to be able to host vast increases of renewable generation capacity, with weather-dependent variability in generation amounts and changing electricity flow patterns across the Union, and to be able to address new demand such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Investment in grids, within and across borders, is crucial to the proper functioning of the internal electricity market, including security of supply. Such investment is necessary to integrate renewable energy and demand in a context where they are located further apart than in the past and, ultimately, to deliver on the Union climate and energy targets. Therefore, any reform of the Union’s electricity market should contribute to a more integrated European electricity network, with a view to ensuring that each Member State reaches a level of electricity interconnectivity in accordance with the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15 % pursuant to Article 4, point (d)(1), of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, that that interconnection capacity is used as much as possible for cross-border trade and that the Union’s electricity network and connectivity infrastructure are built or upgraded, such as the Union projects of common interest established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc15-L_202401747EN.000101-E0015" href="#ntr15-L_202401747EN.000101-E0015"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">15</span>)</a>. Adequate connectivity should be provided to all Union citizens and undertakings as this can result in major opportunities for them to participate in the energy transition and the digital transformation of the Union. Special consideration should be given to the outermost regions referred to in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which recognises their specific constraints and provides for the adoption of specific measures in their regard.</p>

Building on and seizing the potential of the digitalisation of the energy system, such as active participation by consumers, is a key element of future electricity markets and systems in the Union. At the same time, there is a need to respect consumer choices and allow consumers to benefit from a variety of contractual offers, and to shield household customers from high prices during an energy crisis. Energy system integration is intended to be the planning and operation of the energy system as a whole, across multiple energy carriers, infrastructures and consumption sectors, by creating stronger links between them, in synergy with each other and supported by digitalisation with the objective of delivering secure, affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.</p>

Since variable renewable energy generators are only able to accurately estimate their production close to the delivery time, it is crucial for them to maximise trading opportunities via access to a liquid market as close as possible to the time of delivery of the electricity. The gate closure time of the cross-zonal intraday market should therefore be shortened and set closer to real time in order to maximise the opportunities for market participants to trade shortages and surplus of electricity and contribute to better integrating variable renewable energy sources into the electricity system. Where that change creates security of supply risks and to allow for a cost-efficient transition to the shorter cross-zonal gate closure time, the transmission system operators should have the possibility to request a derogation, on the basis of an impact assessment and subject to approval by the regulatory authority concerned, in order to obtain an extension of the implementation timeline. That request should include an action plan with concrete steps towards the implementation of the new intraday cross-zonal gate closure time.</p>

The liquidity of the intraday markets should be improved with the sharing of the order books between market operators within a bidding zone, also when the cross-zonal capacities are set to zero or after the gate closure time of the intraday market. In order to ensure that order books are shared between nominated electricity market operators (NEMOs) in the day-ahead and intraday market coupling time frames, NEMOs should submit all orders for day-ahead and intraday products, and products with the same characteristics to the single day-ahead and intraday coupling and should not organise the trading of day-ahead or intraday products, or products with the same characteristics outside the single day-ahead and intraday coupling. To address the inherent risk of discrimination in the trading of day-ahead and intraday products inside and outside the single day-ahead and intraday coupling, and the consequent draining of liquidity in the Union’s coupled electricity markets, that obligation should apply to NEMOs, to undertakings which directly or indirectly exercise control over a NEMO, and to undertakings which are directly or indirectly controlled by a NEMO. To improve the transparency on the markets, the market participants should provide, where applicable, information by generation units without prejudice to the presentation of bids in accordance with the relevant framework in each Member State.</p>

The proposal for a peak-shaving product should be assessed by the regulatory authority concerned as regards achieving a reduction of electricity demand and a reduction of the impact on wholesale electricity price during peak hours. As the peak-shaving product aims to reduce and shift the electricity consumption and in order to avoid increasing of greenhouse gas emissions, the activation of the peak-shaving product should not imply starting fossil fuel-based generation located behind the metering point. As the peak-shaving product is intended to be applied only in limited situations of regional or Union-wide electricity price crisis, its procurement may take place up to one week ahead of releasing additional demand response capacities. System operators should be able to activate the peak-shaving product before or within the day-ahead market time frame. Alternatively, it should be possible for the peak-shaving product to be activated automatically based on a pre-defined electricity price. In order to verify volumes of reduction of electricity consumption, the system operator should use a baseline reflecting the expected electricity consumption without the activation of the peak-shaving product, and should, after consulting market participants, develop a baseline methodology. That methodology should be approved by the regulatory authority concerned. ACER should assess the impact of using peak-shaving products on the Union electricity market, taking into account the need for peak-shaving products not to unduly distort the functioning of the electricity markets or to cause a redirection of demand response towards peak-shaving products, and should be able to issue recommendations to regulatory authorities to be taken into account in their assessment at national level. Furthermore, ACER should assess the impact of developing peak-shaving products on the Union electricity market under normal circumstances. On the basis of that assessment, the Commission should be able, where appropriate, to submit a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/943 in order to introduce peak-shaving products outside electricity price crisis situations.</p>

To that extent, regional virtual hubs should not be understood as entities arranging or executing transactions. The regional virtual hubs, by providing a reference price index, would enable the pooling of liquidity and provide additional hedging opportunities to market participants.

To that end, network tariffs should be designed to take into account the operational and capital expenditures of system operators or an efficient combination of both so that they can operate the electricity system cost-efficiently. The requirement for cost-reflectiveness should not restrict the opportunity to redistribute costs efficiently where locational- or time-variant network charges are applied. This would further contribute to integrating energy from renewable sources at the least cost for the electricity system and enable final customers to value their flexibility solutions. Regulatory authorities will play a central role in ensuring that sufficient investment is provided for the necessary grid development, expansion and reinforcement. Regulatory authorities should promote public acceptance and the use of anticipatory investment, encouraging the acceleration of grid development to meet the accelerated deployment of renewable generation, including, where appropriate, in designated renewables acceleration areas and smart electrified demand.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Offshore renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind, ocean energy and floating photovoltaic, will play an instrumental role in building a power system largely based on renewable energy sources and in ensuring climate neutrality by 2050. There are, however, substantial obstacles to their wider and efficient deployment preventing the massive scale up needed to achieve those objectives. Similar obstacles could arise for other offshore technologies in the future. In order to reduce investment risk for offshore project developers, instruments such as power purchase agreements (PPAs) or two-way contracts for difference could be used to facilitate the development of offshore projects. For offshore hybrid projects connected to more than one market in an offshore bidding zone, there is an additional risk associated with the unique topographical situation related to market access. To reduce the risks for such projects, transmission system operators should compensate where, in the validated capacity calculation results, they either have not made available the capacity agreed in the connection agreements on the interconnector or have not made available the capacity on the critical network elements pursuant to the capacity calculation rules laid down in Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, or both. Transmission system operators should pay no compensation if, in the validated capacity calculation results, they have made available the capacity of the interconnector at or above the connection agreement requirements as well as the capacity on critical network elements in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943. In the respective connection agreement with the offshore renewable electricity generation plant operator, transmission system operators should strive to give the total agreed capacity as firm, not flexible, and in line with the framework for connection agreements established in Directive (EU) 2019/944. Member States should be informed sufficiently in advance about the connection agreement. Compensation should be payable either if the available transmission capacities are reduced to the extent that the full amount of electricity generation that the offshore renewable electricity generation plant would have otherwise been able to export cannot be delivered to the surrounding markets, or where, despite being able to export, there is a corresponding price decrease in the offshore bidding zone due to capacity reductions as compared to without-capacity reductions, or both. The compensation should be paid from congestion income. It should apply where one or more transmission system operators have not made sufficient capacity available to export the electricity generation capability on their respective interconnector up to the capacity agreed in the connection agreement, and should be provided by those transmission system operators. In the interest of regional fairness, if the insufficient capacity is due to other transmission system operators having not made available the capacity on their critical network elements, pursuant to the capacity calculation rules laid down in Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, the costs of compensation should be shared proportionately between those transmission system operators in line with the polluter pays principle. In addition, any compensation not covered by that proportionate sharing may be divided between the relevant parties in the Member States involved in the offshore hybrid project as part of their cost sharing arrangements. That compensation should not result in overcompensation and is intended to balance the reduced revenues of offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators due to reduced access to interconnected markets. It should be related only to the production capability available to the market, which may be weather dependent and which excludes the outage and maintenance operations of the offshore project. The compensation in the case of a lack of access to the transmission network should not be interpreted as constituting priority dispatch and should be aligned with the principles of non-discrimination and maximisation of cross-border capacities for trade pursuant to Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943. Moreover, there should be no double-compensation for the same risk covered under that provision, for example if the risk is already covered under a contract for difference or another relevant support scheme. Details of that compensation mechanism and the methodology for the implementation to be developed including the conditions under which the measure may expire, such as the existence of sufficient demand within the offshore bidding zone, for example a large electrolyser, or direct access to a sufficient number of markets for the risk to disappear, are intended to be further elaborated in an implementing act including, where relevant, through amendments to Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 <a id="ntc19-L_202401747EN.000101-E0019" href="#ntr19-L_202401747EN.000101-E0019"

In that context, the energy crisis has shown that a surge in the price of gas and hard coal can lead to exceptional and lasting increases of the prices at which the gas and coal-fired generation facilities bid in the day-ahead wholesale market. That in turn has led to exceptionally high prices in the day-ahead market across the Union, as gas and coal-fired generation facilities are often the plants with the highest marginal costs needed to meet the demand for electricity.</p>

PPAs provide long-term price stability for the customer and the necessary certainty for the producer to take the investment decision. Nevertheless, only few Member States have active PPA markets and buyers are typically limited to large companies, including because PPAs face a set of barriers, in particular the difficulty to cover the risk of payment default from the buyer in those long-term agreements. Member States should take into consideration the need to create a dynamic PPA market when setting the policies to achieve the energy decarbonisation objectives laid down in their integrated national energy and climate plans. When designing measures directly affecting PPAs, Member States should respect possible legitimate expectations and take into account the effects of those measures on existing and future PPAs.</p>

In addition, Member States are to describe policies and measures facilitating the uptake of renewables PPAs in their integrated national energy and climate plans. Without prejudice to that obligation to report on the regulatory context affecting the PPA market, Member States should ensure that instruments to reduce the financial risks associated to the buyer defaulting on its long-term payment obligations in the framework of PPAs are accessible to customers that face entry barriers to the PPA market and that are not in financial difficulty. Member States should be able to decide to set up a guarantee scheme at market prices where private guarantees are not accessible or insufficiently accessible. Where a Member State sets up such a guarantee scheme, it should include provisions to avoid lowering the liquidity in the electricity markets, such as by using financial PPAs. Member States could decide to facilitate the aggregation of demand for PPAs from customers that individually face entry barriers to the PPA market, but they should, collectively, be able to provide an attractive offer for PPAs to producers. Member States should not provide support to PPAs for the purchase of electricity generated from fossil fuels. Member States should be able to limit themselves to supporting only guarantee schemes that support new renewable energy generation, in line with their decarbonisation policies, in particular where the market for renewables PPAs is not sufficiently developed. While the default approach should be non-discrimination between consumers, Member States could decide to target those instruments to specific categories of consumers, applying objective and non-discriminatory criteria.

In the assessment of such two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects under State aid rules, the Commission should check compliance of those contracts or schemes with Union law which is intrinsically linked to State aid rules, such as the design principles for two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects as laid down in this Regulation. The design of those two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects should preserve the incentives for the power-generating facility to operate and participate efficiently in the electricity markets, in particular to reflect market circumstances. In its assessment, the Commission should ensure that the design of two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects does not lead to undue distortions to competition and trade in the internal market. The Commission should, in particular, ensure that the distribution of revenues to undertakings does not distort the level playing field in the internal market in particular where no competitive bidding process can be applied. Two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects could vary in duration and could include inter alia injection-based contracts for difference with one or several strike prices, a floor price, or capability or yardstick contracts for difference. The obligation to use two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects does not apply to support schemes not directly linked to electricity generation, such as energy storage, and which do not use direct price support, such as investment aid in the form of upfront grants, tax measures or green certificates. To incentivise the counterparties to fulfil their contractual obligations, two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects should include penalty clauses applicable in the case of undue unilateral early termination of the contract.</p>

This is necessary to ensure that the economic viability of generation technologies with high marginal costs is not jeopardised and to maintain the incentives of the technologies which can offer flexibility to the electricity system to bid in the electricity market based on their opportunity costs. In addition, the limitation to set out direct price support schemes in the form of two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects should not apply to emerging technologies for which other types of direct price support schemes may be better placed to incentivise their uptake. The limitation should be without prejudice to the possible exemption for small-scale renewables installations and demonstration projects pursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and consider the specificities of renewable energy communities in accordance with that Directive. In view of the need to provide regulatory certainty for the producers, the obligation for Member States to apply direct price support schemes for the production of electricity in the form of two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects should apply only to investment in new power-generating facilities using the sources specified in this recital.</p>

To further mitigate the impact of high electricity prices on the energy bills of consumers, Member States should ensure that any revenues collected from producers subject to direct price support schemes in the form of two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects, or the equivalent in financial value of those revenues, are passed on to final customers, including household customers, small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises and energy intensive undertakings. When distributing the revenues to household customers, Member States should in particular be able to favour vulnerable customers and customers affected by energy poverty. In light of the wider benefits for electricity customers resulting from investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low carbon energy deployment, it should also be possible for Member States to use the revenues from two-way contract for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects, or the equivalent in financial value of those revenues, to finance investment to reduce electricity costs for final customers and, including as regards specific economic activities such as investment in distribution grid development, renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It should also be possible for Member States to use such revenues, or the equivalent in financial value of those revenues, to finance the costs of the direct price support schemes. The redistribution of revenues should be done in a way that ensures that customers are still to some extent exposed to the price signal, so that they reduce their consumption when the prices are high, or shift it to periods of lower prices, which are typically periods with a higher share of production of electricity from renewable energy sources. In particular, Member States should be able to consider the consumption in off-peak hours in order to preserve incentives to flexibility. Member States should ensure that the level playing field and competition between the different suppliers is not affected by the redistribution of revenues to the final electricity consumers. Those principles should not be compulsory for revenues generated by contracts under direct price support schemes concluded before the date of application of the obligation to use two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects. It is possible for Member States to distribute revenues from two-way contracts for difference or equivalent schemes with the same effects without that distribution constituting a retail price regulation pursuant to Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.</p>

In order to foster non-fossil flexibility, the regulatory authority or another authority or entity designated by a Member State should periodically assess the need for flexibility at national level in the electricity system on the basis of the input of transmission system operators and distribution system operators and a common European methodology that is subject to public consultation and approval by ACER. The assessment of the flexibility needs of the electricity system should take into account all existing and planned investment, including existing assets that are not yet connected to the grid, with regard to sources of flexibility such as flexible electricity generation, interconnectors, demand response, energy storage or the production of renewable fuels, because of the need to decarbonise the energy system. ACER should periodically assess the national reports and draw up a report at Union level providing recommendations on issues of cross-border relevance. On the basis of the national flexibility needs report, Member States should define an indicative national objective for non-fossil flexibility, including the respective specific contributions of both demand side response and energy storage to that objective, which should also be reflected in their integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In light of those plans, the Commission should be able to draw up a Union strategy on flexibility with a particular focus on demand response and energy storage, which is consistent with the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate and the 2050 climate-neutrality objective. The Commission should be able to issue a legislative proposal to accompany that Union strategy.</p>

Notwithstanding the necessity to limit distortions to competition and the internal market, together with an appropriate regulatory framework, capacity mechanisms can play an important role in ensuring resource adequacy, in particular during the transition towards a carbon-free system and for insufficiently interconnected energy systems. Therefore, while capacity mechanisms should no longer be considered to be measures of last resort, their necessity and design should be periodically assessed in light of the evolving regulatory framework and market circumstances. However, the procedure for the adoption of capacity mechanisms has proved to be complex. To address potential possibilities of streamlining and simplifying the process of applying for a capacity mechanism, and to ensure that adequacy concerns can be addressed by Member States in a timely manner while providing the necessary control to prevent harm for the internal market, the Commission should, by 17 January 2025 submit a detailed report assessing such possibilities. In that context, the Commission should request that ACER amend the methodology for the European resource adequacy assessment in line with the applicable process, as appropriate. After consulting the Member States, the Commission should submit proposals with a view to, as appropriate, simplifying the process of assessing capacity mechanisms by 17 April 2025.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The connection of new generation and demand installations to the grid, in particular renewable energy plants, often faces delays in grid connection procedures. One of the reasons for such delays is the lack of available grid capacity at the location chosen by the investor, which entails a need for grid extensions or reinforcements to connect the installations to the system in a safe manner. A new requirement for electricity system operators, both at transmission and distribution levels, to publish and update information on the capacity available for new connections in their areas of operation would give investors easier access to information of grid capacity availability within the system and thereby accelerate decision-making which, in turn, would accelerate the required deployment of renewable energy. That information should be updated on a regular basis, at least every month, by transmission system operators. Transmission system operators should also publish the criteria used to determine the available grid capacities, such as existing demand and generation capacities, the assumptions made for assessing the possible further integration of additional system users, the relevant information on possible energy curtailment, and the expectation of upcoming relevant network developments.</p>

While progress towards synchronisation is ongoing, one of the critical prerequisites for stable synchronous system operation is the availability of sufficient balancing capacity reserves for frequency regulation. However, being dependent on the Russian synchronous area for frequency management, the Baltic States were not yet in the position to develop their own functioning balancing market. The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has substantially increased the risk for security of supply resulting from the absence of own balancing markets.

The additional procurement process open to participation of generation capacity that does not meet the CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emission limits should be preceded by a procurement process aiming to maximise the participation of capacity that meets the CO<span class="oj-sub">2</span> emission limits, including by letting capacity prices rising high enough to incentivise investment in such capacity.</p>

On the basis of such review, the Commission should submit a comprehensive report to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied by a legislative proposal, where appropriate. In that report, the Commission should assess, in particular, the effectiveness of the current structure and functioning of the short-term electricity markets, as well as their potential inefficiencies and possible remedies and tools to be applied in crisis or emergency situations and the suitability of Union legal and financing framework on distribution grids. That report should also cover the ability to achieve the Union’s renewable and internal energy market objectives and the potential and viability of the establishment of one or several Union market platforms for PPAs.</p>
