Regulation (EU) 2021/696 envisages that in a first phase of the GOVSATCOM component, until approximately 2025, existing capacity would be pooled and shared through the GOVSATCOM Hub. In that context, the Commission is to procure GOVSATCOM capacities from Member States with national systems and space capacities and from commercial satellite communication or service providers, taking into account the essential security interests of the Union.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">In that first phase, GOVSATCOM services are to be introduced on the basis of a step-by-step approach, in light of the scaling up of the GOVSATCOM Hub infrastructure capabilities. That approach is also based on the premise that if in the course of the first phase a detailed analysis of future supply and demand reveals that it was insufficient to cover the evolving demand, it will be necessary to move to a second phase and develop additional bespoke space infrastructure or capacities through cooperation with the private sector, for example with Union satellite operators.</p>

Subsequent analyses by the Commission showed that the Union’s current satellite communication offer, on the basis of capacities from Member States with national systems as well as the private sector, cannot meet certain new needs of the governmental demand which are moving towards higher security solutions, low latency and global coverage.

There is therefore a window of opportunity for addressing the evolving needs of government-authorised users by developing and deploying additional infrastructure as filings for the frequencies with the International Telecommunication Union which are necessary to provide the required services are currently available within the Union. If not used, those filings for the frequencies will become obsolete and be attributed to other players. As frequencies and orbital slots are an increasingly scarce resource, the Commission, through an open and transparent process with the Member States, should seize this opportunity to conclude with the Member States providing the filings for the frequencies dedicated licensing agreements for the provision of governmental services based on the governmental infrastructure. The private sector is responsible for obtaining the rights on filings for the frequencies required for the provision of commercial services.</p>

Affordable and cost-effective access to satellite communication is also indispensable in areas where there is no terrestrial infrastructure, including over oceans, in airspace, in remote areas and where terrestrial infrastructure faces serious outage or cannot be trusted in crisis situations. Satellite communication can increase the overall resilience of communication networks, for example offering an alternative in the case of physical attacks or cyberattacks on local terrestrial infrastructure, accidents or natural or man-made disasters.</p>

In accordance with the Declaration, EuroQCI aims to deploy a certified secure end-to-end quantum communication infrastructure, enabling information and data to be transmitted and stored and to be capable of linking critical public communication assets throughout the Union. The Programme will contribute to meeting the objectives of the Declaration by developing a EuroQCI space and ground infrastructure integrated into the governmental infrastructure of the Programme, as well as by developing and deploying the EuroQCI terrestrial infrastructure, which will be owned by the Member States. The EuroQCI space, ground and terrestrial infrastructure should be developed within the Programme in two main phases, a preliminary validation phase, which may involve the development and validation of several different technologies and communication protocols, and a full-deployment phase including appropriate solutions for inter-satellite connectivity and data relay between satellites, the ground and the terrestrial infrastructure.</p>

While the space assets do not themselves emit greenhouse gases while in use, their manufacturing and associated ground facilities do have an environmental impact. Measures should be adopted to mitigate that impact. To that end, the procurement referred to under the Programme should include principles and measures on sustainability, such as provisions to minimise and offset the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the development, production and deployment of the infrastructure, and measures to prevent light pollution, such as the impact on ground-based astronomical observations.</p>

As legitimate concerns on the protection of space environment are being discussed in international fora, such as within the United Nations’ Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, it is of the utmost importance that the Union shows leadership in space sustainability. The contracts procured under the Programme should ensure that the technology deployed enables the highest possible standards when it comes to sustainability, as well as energy and resource efficiency.</p>

When assessing those requirements the current market capacities should be used to the largest extent possible. From those operational requirements, in combination with the general security requirements and evolving demand of governmental services, the service portfolio for governmental services should be developed. That service portfolio should establish the applicable baseline for the governmental services. It should also identify the categories of service which complement the service portfolio of the GOVSATCOM services established within the framework of Regulation (EU) 2021/696. The Commission should ensure the consistency and coherence of operational and security requirements between the GOVSATCOM component and the Programme. In order to maintain the best possible match between the demand and supply of services, the service portfolio for governmental services should be identified in 2023 and should be able to be regularly updated, after consulting Member States on the basis of those operational and security requirements.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">For the implementation of the Programme, the concession contracts, supply, service or works contracts or mixed contracts should follow key principles. Such contracts should establish a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities between the public and private partners, including a clear allocation of risks between them, with a view to ensuring that the contractors assume responsibility for the consequences of any failings for which they are liable. The contracts should ensure that contractors do not receive overcompensation for the provision of governmental services, allow the provision of commercial services to be established by the private sector and ensure an appropriate prioritisation of government-authorised users’ needs. The contracts should ensure that the provision of services based on commercial infrastructure preserves the Union’s essential interests and the Programme’s general and specific objectives. It is therefore important that there are measures in place to ensure that those essential interests and objectives are preserved. In particular, the Commission should be able to take necessary measures to ensure service continuity in the event that the contractor is unable to fulfil its obligations.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">The contracts should include adequate safeguards to prevent, inter alia, conflicts of interest and potential distortions of competition stemming from the provision of commercial services, undue discrimination or any other hidden indirect advantages. Such safeguards may include separation of accounts between governmental and commercial services, including the setting up of a structurally and legally separate entity from the vertically integrated operator for the provision of governmental services, as well as open, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure necessary for the provision of commercial services. Therefore, commercial services should be available to existing terrestrial services providers under transparent and non-discriminatory conditions. The contracts should foster the participation of start-ups and SMEs along the whole value chain and across Member States.</p>

The Commission should determine the main technical and operational requirements necessary to implement systems and services evolution. It should do so after consulting Member States’ experts, users and other relevant public or private stakeholders. Finally, in accordance with Article 4(3) TFEU, the exercise of competence by the Union does not result in Member States being prevented from exercising their respective competences. However, to make good use of the Union funds, it is appropriate that the Commission ensures, as far as possible, the consistency of activities performed in the context of the Programme, with those of the Member States, without creating any unnecessary duplication of efforts.</p>

That governance should be based on three key principles. Firstly, it is imperative that Member States’ extensive, unique experience in security matters be taken into consideration to the greatest possible extent. Secondly, in order to prevent conflicts of interest and any shortcomings in applying security rules, operational functions should be segregated from security accreditation functions. Thirdly, the entity in charge of managing all or part of the Programme’s infrastructure is also the best suited to manage the security of the tasks entrusted to it. The security of the Programme would build upon the experience gained in the implementation of the Union Space Programme over the past years. Sound security governance also requires that roles be appropriately distributed among the various players. As it is responsible for the Programme, the Commission, without prejudice to Member States’ prerogatives in the area of national security, should determine together with the Member States the general security requirements applicable to the Programme. In particular in the area of classified information, the security governance of the Programme should reflect the respective roles and fields of competence of the Council and the Member States in the evaluation and approval of cryptographic products for protecting EUCI.</p>
