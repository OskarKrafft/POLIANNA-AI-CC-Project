Likewise, the economic and social consequences of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine are still unfolding. This has made the work on the Union’s political priorities even more urgent, in particular ensuring that the economy works for people and attaining the objectives of the European Green Deal. The insurance and reinsurance sector can provide private sources of financing to European businesses and can make the economy more resilient by supplying protection against a wide range of risks. With this dual role, the sector has a great potential to contribute to the achievement of the Union’s priorities.</p>

To facilitate insurers’ contribution to the financing of the economic recovery of the Union, the prudential framework should be adjusted to better take into account the long-term nature of the insurance business. In particular, when calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement under the standard formula, the possibility to use a more favourable standard parameter for equity investments which are held with a long-term perspective should be facilitated, provided that insurance and reinsurance undertakings comply with sound and robust criteria, that preserve policy holder protection and financial stability. Such criteria should aim to ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are able to avoid forced selling of equities intended to be held for the long term, including under stressed market conditions. As insurance and reinsurance undertakings have a wide variety of risk-management tools to avoid such forced selling, those criteria should recognise such variety and not require the legal or contractual ring-fencing of long-term investment assets in order for insurance and reinsurance undertakings to benefit from the more favourable standard parameter for equity investments. In addition, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking’s management should commit to a minimum holding period of the equities that the undertaking invests in through written policies and demonstrate the ability of the undertaking to maintain those equities over that holding period.</p>

The integration of the internal market for insurance increases competition and the availability of insurance products across Member States to the benefit of businesses and consumers. Insurance failures in the Union internal market for insurance since the application of Directive 2009/138/EC emphasise the need for more consistency and convergence of supervision across the Union. The supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings operating under the freedom to provide services and the right of establishment should be further improved without undermining the objective of further integrating the internal market for insurance to ensure consistent consumer protection and safeguarding fair competition across the internal market.</p>

Following the first years of application of Directive 2009/138/EC and with a view to ensuring that it does not unduly apply to undertakings of reduced size, it is appropriate to review those exclusions by increasing those thresholds, so that small undertakings that fulfil certain conditions are not subject to that Directive. As is already the case with insurance undertakings excluded from the scope of Directive 2009/138/EC, undertakings benefitting from such increased thresholds should have the option to keep or seek authorisation under that Directive in order to benefit from the single license provided therein and it should be possible for Member States to subject insurance undertakings that are excluded from the scope of Directive 2009/138/EC to provisions that are similar or identical to the ones provided for in that Directive.</p>

The first condition states that the assistance is to be related to accidents or breakdowns involving a road vehicle which occur in the territory of the Member State of the undertaking providing cover. That provision could imply that a requirement of authorisation as insurer would apply to providers of assistance of road vehicles in the event of an accident or breakdown that occurs just across the border and could unduly disrupt assistance. For this reason, it is appropriate to review that condition. Therefore, the condition under Article 6(1), point (a), of Directive 2009/138/EC should be extended to accidents or breakdowns involving a road vehicle that might occur occasionally in a neighbouring country of the Member State of the undertaking providing cover.</p>

In view of increased insurance group activities in different Member States, it is necessary to enhance the convergent application of Union law and the exchange of information between the supervisory authorities, in particular before authorisations are granted. Therefore, where several supervisory authorities need to be consulted, any supervisory authority concerned should be allowed to request a joint assessment of an application for authorisation from the supervisory authority of the Member State where the authorisation process of a future insurance or reinsurance undertaking of the group is ongoing. The decision to grant the authorisation remains the competence of the supervisory authority of the home Member State in which the undertaking concerned seeks authorisation. However, the results of the joint assessment should be taken into consideration when making that decision.</p>

Some risks, such as climate change risks, are difficult to quantify or they materialise over a period that is longer than the one used for the calibration of the Solvency Capital Requirement. Those risks can be better taken into account in the own-risk and solvency assessment. Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings have material exposure to climate change risks, they should be required to carry out, within appropriate intervals and as part of the own-risk and solvency assessment, analyses of the impact of long-term climate change risk scenarios on their business. Such analyses should be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business of the undertakings. In particular, while the assessment of the materiality of exposure to climate change risks should be required from all insurance and reinsurance undertakings, long-term climate change scenario analyses should not be required for small and non-complex undertakings.</p>

However, it should be possible for Member States that already apply audit requirements to all undertakings or to elements of the solvency and financial condition report other than the balance sheet, to continue applying such requirements.</p>

In particular, it can happen that smaller insurance and reinsurance undertakings do not have the capacities to hedge interest rate risk with instruments other than bonds, loans or similar assets with fixed cash-flows. The relevant risk-free interest rate term structure should therefore be extrapolated for maturities where the markets for bonds are no longer deep, liquid and transparent. However, the method for the extrapolation should make use of information derived from relevant financial instruments other than bonds, where such information is available from deep, liquid and transparent markets for maturities where the bond markets are no longer deep, liquid and transparent. To ensure certainty and harmonised application while also allowing for timely reaction to changes in market conditions, the Commission should adopt delegated acts to specify how the new extrapolation method should apply. In light of current market conditions, the starting point for the extrapolation for the euro at the date of entry into force of this amending Directive should remain at the same level as its level on 31 December 2023, namely at a maturity of 20 years.</p>

The use of a uniform volatility adjustment for entire currencies or countries can lead to benefits in excess of a mitigation of exaggerated bond spreads, in particular where the sensitivity of relevant assets of those insurance and reinsurance undertakings to changes in credit spreads is lower than the sensitivity of the relevant best estimate to changes in interest rates. In order to avoid such excessive benefits from the volatility adjustment, the volatility adjustment should be subject to supervisory approval and its calculation should take into account undertaking-specific characteristics related to the spread sensitivity of assets and the interest rate sensitivity of the best estimate of technical provisions. Moreover, minimum conditions for the use of the volatility adjustment should be introduced as an additional safeguard. Member States, some of which already subject the use of the volatility adjustment to a supervisory approval process, should have the option to extend the conditions for approval to include an assessment against the underlying assumptions of the volatility adjustment. In light of the additional safeguards, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should be allowed to add up to an increased proportion of 85 % of the risk-corrected spread derived from the representative portfolios to the basic risk-free interest rate term structure.</p>

This should be achieved via a recalibration of the interest rate risk sub-module to reflect the existence of a negative yield environment. At the same time, the methodology to be used should not result in unrealistically large decreases in the liquid part of the curve and that could be avoided by providing for an explicit floor to represent a lower bound of negative interest rates. In line with interest rates dynamics, the Commission should aim at introducing a floor that is term dependent rather than flat, to the extent that the available market data allows for a robust risk-based calibration of such term-dependency.</p>

Partial and full internal models allow to capture the individual risk of an undertaking better and Directive 2009/138/EC allows insurance and reinsurance undertakings to use them for determining capital requirements without limitations stemming from the standard formula. Supervisory authorities would benefit from access also to estimates of the Solvency Capital Requirements determined in accordance with the standard formula in order to make comparisons across undertakings and to make comparisons for a given undertaking over time. All insurance and reinsurance undertakings using a full or partial internal model should therefore regularly report to their supervisory authorities an estimate of the Solvency Capital Requirement determined in accordance with the standard formula. Such an estimate should appropriately reflect the methods and underlying assumptions of the standard formula facilitating a proper supervisory assessment. In order to avoid an excessive burden for undertakings when determining the estimate, they should be allowed to make use of information derived from the relevant simplifications in the standard formula laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC and the delegated acts adopted pursuant to that Directive. Where such a simplified approach is used to determine the estimate of the Solvency Capital Requirement, the underlying assumptions should be clearly explained to the satisfaction of supervisory authorities.</p>

As the use of the volatility adjustment can lead to benefits in excess of a mitigation of exaggerated bond spreads in the calculation of the best estimate, such excessive benefits can also distort the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement where the effect of credit spread movements on the volatility adjustment is taken into account in the internal model. In order to avoid such distortion, the Solvency Capital Requirement should be floored, where supervisory authorities allow insurance and reinsurance undertakings to take into account the effect of credit spread movements on the volatility adjustment in their internal model, at a level below which benefits on the Solvency Capital Requirement in excess of a mitigation of exaggerated bond spreads are expected to occur.</p>

Even if this intermediate unregulated holding company does not have any insurance or reinsurance subsidiary undertaking whose head office is located in the Union, it is important that it can be treated similarly to an insurance holding company or a mixed financial holding company and be included in the group solvency calculations.

Where insurance and reinsurance undertakings are part of a group whose parent undertaking has its head office in a third country that is not deemed equivalent or temporarily equivalent in accordance with Article 260 of that Directive, exercising group supervision is more challenging. Group supervisors might decide to apply so-called ‘other methods’ in accordance with Article 262 of that Directive to such groups. However, those methods are not clearly defined and the objectives that those other methods should achieve are uncertain. If not addressed, that issue could lead to unwanted effects on the level playing field between groups whose ultimate parent undertaking is located in the Union and groups whose ultimate parent undertaking is located in a non-equivalent third country. Therefore, the purpose of the other methods should be further specified, including a minimum set of measures that group supervisors should consider. In particular, those methods should warrant the same level of protection for all policy holders of insurance or reinsurance undertakings which have their head office in the Union, irrespective of the location of the head office of the ultimate parent undertaking of the group to which such insurance or reinsurance undertakings belong.</p>

The duration-based equity risk submodule, which also aims at reflecting the lower risk of investing over a longer time horizon, but is of very limited use in the Union, is subject to criteria that are stricter than those applicable to long-term equity investments. Therefore, the new prudential category of long-term equity investments appears to obviate the need for the existing duration-based equity risk submodule. As there is no need to keep two distinct preferential treatments which have the same objective of rewarding long-term investments, the duration-based equity risk submodule should be deleted. However, in order to avoid a situation whereby that deletion leads to adverse effects, a grandfathering clause should be provided for with respect to insurers which are currently applying the duration-based equity risk submodule.</p>

The provisions of Directive 2009/138/EC on capital requirements should not impede sustainable investments by insurance and reinsurance undertakings but should reflect the full risk of investments in environmentally harmful activities. Therefore, there is a need to assess whether the available evidence on risk differentials between environmentally or socially harmful and other investments is sufficient to justify a differentiated prudential treatment. In order to ensure an appropriate assessment of the relevant evidence, EIOPA should monitor and report by 1 March 2025 on the evidence on the risk profile of environmentally or socially harmful investments. Where appropriate, EIOPA’s report should advise on changes to Directive 2009/138/EC and to the delegated and implementing acts adopted pursuant to that Directive. It should be possible for EIOPA to also inquire whether it would be appropriate that certain environmental risks, other than climate change-related risks, should be taken into account and how. For instance, if evidence so suggests, EIOPA could analyse the need for extending scenario analyses as introduced by this Directive in the context of climate change-related risks to other environmental risks.</p>

This could also change the exposure of insurance and reinsurance undertakings to natural catastrophe risk and render invalid the standard parameters for natural catastrophe risk set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. In order to ensure that there is no persistent discrepancy between the standard parameters for natural catastrophe risk and the actual exposure of insurance and reinsurance companies to such risks, EIOPA should review regularly the scope of the natural catastrophe risk module and the calibrations of its standard parameters. For that purpose, EIOPA should take into account the latest available evidence from climate science and, where discrepancies are found, it should submit an opinion to the Commission accordingly.</p>

While the transitional measures should encourage undertakings to comply with that Directive as soon as possible, the application of transitional measures approved for the first time long after 2016 is likely to slow down the path to compliance with that Directive. Such approval of the use of those transitional measures should therefore be restricted to cases where an insurance or reinsurance undertaking becomes for the first time subject to the rules of Directive 2009/138/EC or where an undertaking has accepted a portfolio of insurance or reinsurance contracts and the transferring undertaking applied, before the transfer, a transitional measure with respect to the obligations relating to that portfolio.</p>

To that end, the Commission should assess the appropriateness of existing calibrations for investments in securitisation that are set out in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Directive 2009/138/EC, taking into account available market data, and their consistency with capital requirements that are applicable to investments in other fixed-income securities. On the basis of such an assessment, and where appropriate, the Commission should consider amending the delegated act setting capital requirements applicable to investments in securitisation. Such amendments, which should be risk-based and evidence-based, could include the introduction of a more granular set of risk factors depending on the ranking of the securitisation tranches, or differentiating between different types of non-STS securitisation depending on their risks.</p>
