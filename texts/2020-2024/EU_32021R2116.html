Accordingly, the Union should set the basic policy objectives, types of intervention and basic Union requirements while greater responsibility and accountability for meeting those objectives should be borne by the Member States. As a consequence, there is a need to ensure greater subsidiarity and flexibility in order to take better account of the local conditions and needs. Accordingly, under the new CAP delivery model, Member States should be responsible for tailoring their CAP interventions in line with their specific needs and basic Union requirements in order to maximise their contribution to Union’s CAP objectives. In order to continue to ensure a common approach and a level playing field, Member States should also establish and design the compliance and control framework for beneficiaries, including compliance with standards for good agricultural and environmental conditions and statutory management requirements.</p>

An agricultural reserve should be maintained to support the agricultural sector in the event of market developments or crises affecting agricultural production or distribution. Article 12(2), point (d), of the Financial Regulation provides that non-committed appropriations may be carried over only to the following financial year, within the meaning of Article 9 of the Financial Regulation (‘budgetary year’). In order to simplify significantly the implementation for beneficiaries and national administrations, a roll-over mechanism should be used, using any unused amounts of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector established in the year 2022. For that purpose, a derogation from Article 12(2), point (d), of the Financial Regulation is necessary, allowing for non-committed appropriations of the agricultural reserve to be carried over to finance the agricultural reserve in the following budgetary years until the year 2027. Furthermore, as regards the budgetary year 2022, a derogation is necessary as the total unused amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector available at the end of the budgetary year 2022 should be carried over to the budgetary year 2023 to the corresponding line of the new agricultural reserve established under this Regulation without being fully returned to the budgetary lines which cover direct payment interventions under the CAP Strategic Plan. However, in order to maximise the amounts to be reimbursed to farmers in the budgetary year 2023, all other availabilities under the EAGF sub-ceiling for the budgetary year 2023 set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 should be used first to set up the new agricultural reserve in the budgetary year 2023.</p>

Interventions for rural development should be financed from the Union budget on the basis of commitments made in annual instalments. Member States should be able to draw on the Union funds provided for as soon as the CAP Strategic Plans are approved. A suitably restricted prefinancing system is therefore needed to ensure a steady flow of funds so that payments to beneficiaries under the interventions are made at the appropriate time.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Conditionality is an important element of the CAP which ensures that payments promote a high degree of sustainability and ensure a level playing field for farmers within Member States and within the Union, in particular with regard to the social, environmental and climate elements of the CAP but also concerning public health and animal welfare. This implies that controls should be carried out and, where necessary, penalties should be applied to ensure the effectiveness of the conditionality system. To ensure such a level playing field between beneficiaries in different Member States, certain general rules on conditionality and on controls and penalties related to non-compliance should be introduced at Union level.</p>

To ensure the proportionality, effectiveness and dissuasive effect of the penalties, it is appropriate to lay down the rules for the application and calculation of such penalties. Taking into account the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘Court of Justice’) in case C-361/19 <a id="ntc18-L_2021435EN.01018701-E0018" href="#ntr18-L_2021435EN.01018701-E0018"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">18</span>)</a>, to ensure the link between the farmer’s behaviour and the penalty, it should be laid down that, as a general rule, the penalty should be calculated on the basis of the payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance occurred. However, where the nature of the finding does not allow for the year in which the non-compliance occurred to be established, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the penalty system, it is necessary to establish that, for those cases, the penalty should be calculated on the basis of the payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance was detected. To ensure an effective and coherent approach by Member States, it is necessary to provide for a minimum penalty rate at Union level for non-compliance. Such minimum rates should be applied by Member States depending on the severity, extent, permanence or reoccurrence and intentionality of the non-compliance determined. To ensure proportionality of the penalties, Member States should provide that no penalties are to be applied where the non-compliance has no or only insignificant consequences for the achievement of the objective of the standard or requirement concerned, and set up an awareness mechanism to ensure that beneficiaries are informed about the non-compliance detected and possible remedial actions to be taken.</p>

That mechanism should remain independent from, and should not affect, the functioning of the particular social model of each Member State, nor should it in any way affect the independence of the judiciary. To that end, a clear separation of responsibilities should be ensured between the authorities or bodies responsible for the enforcement of social and employment legislation and applicable labour standards on the one hand and the agricultural paying agencies on the other, the role of the latter being execution of payments and application of penalties. The autonomy of social partners, as well as their right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements, should be fully respected. Their autonomy should also be respected where social partners are responsible for carrying out controls on working conditions.</p>

With regard to implementing acts related to payments made to the Member States and the operation of the clearance of accounts procedure and annual performance clearance, the advisory procedure enables the Commission to fully assume its responsibility of managing the budget and verifying the annual accounts of the national paying agencies with a view to accepting such accounts or, in the case of expenditure not effected in compliance with Union rules, to excluding such expenditure from Union financing.
