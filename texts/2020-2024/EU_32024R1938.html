Although those Directives have harmonised to a certain degree the rules of Member States in the area of quality and safety of blood, tissues and cells, they include a significant number of options and possibilities for Member States to implement the rules they laid down. This has resulted in divergences between national rules, which can create obstacles to cross-border sharing of such substances. A fundamental revision of those Directives is needed for a robust, transparent, up-to-date and sustainable regulatory framework for such substances, which achieves quality and safety of all SoHO, enhances legal certainty for patients and stakeholders involved and supports continuous supply, including the cross-border exchange of SoHO, whilst facilitating innovation for the benefit of public health. In order to achieve a coherent application of the legal framework, it is appropriate to repeal Directives 2002/98/EC and 2004/23/EC and to replace them by a Regulation.</p>

In addition, many authorities and operators work across those sectors.

Since donation and human application of SoHO other than those regulated by Directives 2002/98/EC and 2004/23/EC are increasingly common, it is necessary to extend the scope of this Regulation to any SoHO, in order to prevent a situation in which certain groups of SoHO donors or SoHO recipients and offspring from medically assisted reproduction are not protected by an appropriate Union level quality and safety framework. This will, for example, ensure the protection of SoHO donors and SoHO recipients of human breast milk, intestinal microbiota, blood preparations that are not used for transfusion, and any other SoHO that might be applied to humans in the future.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">SoHO are frequently processed prior to distribution or, in the autologous context, prior to human application. Processing can have objectives such as: preservation by, for example, cooling, freezing or freeze-drying; pathogen inactivation by, for example, washing, antibiotic decontamination or sterilisation; or physical separation or purification into selected elements by, for example, centrifugation of blood to prepare red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates and plasma as separate components. If not performed correctly and in a consistent manner, processing steps carry risks of contamination or of changing the inherent properties of SoHO in a manner that might reduce their effectiveness. Therefore, processing of SoHO should be considered as a SoHO activity and any entity performing SoHO processing should be subject to appropriate oversight, including an obligation to obtain an authorisation for any SoHO preparation they distribute or apply. In cases where a surgical team prepares distributed SoHO for human application, without removal from the surgical field and immediately prior to the human application, such preparatory handling should not be considered as processing for the purposes of this Regulation. Such preparatory handling might include rinsing or rehydration, in accordance with the instructions provided with the SoHO, or cutting and shaping to render the SoHO suitable for the intended use in the SoHO recipient, for allogeneic or autologous use. In addition, in the autologous context, the preparation of SoHO during and for the purpose of human application as part of the same surgical intervention in which they were collected and without removal from the surgical field should not be considered as processing for the purposes of this Regulation. The necessary procedures to be carried out, in accordance with the instructions provided with the SoHO preparation, immediately prior to human application, of released and distributed SoHO should not be considered as processing for the purposes of this Regulation. Mixing of released human breast milk with medication before human application should also not be considered as processing.</p>

Any SoHO entity carrying out release should be authorised as a SoHO establishment. SoHO that are distributed or exported should first have been subjected to a release step. In cases where the receiving SoHO entity carries out a further processing step on released and distributed SoHO, those SoHO should be subjected to a second release step prior to re-distribution. In the case of autologous, bedside or in-surgery processing of SoHO without storage, it would be impractical to require a release step prior to the re-application of the SoHO preparation to the SoHO recipient. In such cases, quality control tests and checks should instead be incorporated in the processing steps that have been authorised.

However, certain obligations of this Regulation should apply to SoHO recipient-outcome monitoring in the context of the human application of SoHO to SoHO recipients as part of a plan to generate evidence for SoHO preparation authorisation. Clinical registries to record the clinical data generated during the clinical-outcome monitoring are useful tools that allow for more efficient data collection from aggregated groups of SoHO recipients, applying standardised outcome measurements and reflecting outcomes in the ‘real world’ setting. Managing such registries should be considered as a SoHO activity, as it ensures that data quality and data management procedures are robust and allow for the data to be used for the purpose of SoHO preparation authorisation. The transfer of such outcome data from local or national registries to international registries should be promoted as it facilitates the aggregation and analysis of significantly larger data cohorts of SoHO recipients and can contribute to earlier SoHO preparation authorisations and access to SoHO therapies.</p>

Therefore, there should be an assessment and authorisation of the processes applied to ensure that they are demonstrated to be safe and effective for the SoHO recipient. In such cases, the SoHO preparation authorisation should specify the required quality control tests and checks to be performed during the process, and therefore, no release step should be required before human application to the SoHO recipient. Similarly, in the case of intra-uterine insemination for within-relationship use, where SoHO are collected and processed from one of the partners before being applied to the other partner without storage, such SoHO should not be subject to a SoHO release step but the SoHO preparation authorisation should specify the required quality control tests and checks to be performed during collection, processing and human application. Where SoHO for autologous use, or SoHO for within-relationship use, are collected to be processed and also stored, risks of cross-contamination, loss of traceability or damage to the biological properties inherent to the substance, and necessary for effectiveness in the SoHO recipient, also appear.

Conversely, where the device element has an ancillary function, for example in the case of demineralised bone that is mixed with a synthetic gel to facilitate delivery to the patient as a bone graft, the final combination should be regulated as a SoHO. In both cases, each element of the combination should be fully in compliance with the relevant regulatory framework. Therefore, the demineralised bone in those examples should be subject to the SoHO preparation authorisation provisions of this Regulation, to ensure the property of inducing bone formation is preserved, and the medical device element should have a CE mark for the purpose for which it is being used.

The SoHO entity concept includes this broad range of entities, from SoHO donor registries to hospitals and clinics where SoHO are applied to SoHO recipients or SoHO processing devices are used at the SoHO recipient’s bedside. The registration of all such SoHO entities should ensure that SoHO competent authorities have a clear overview of the field and its scale and can take enforcement action when deemed necessary. A SoHO entity registration should refer to the legal entity, regardless of the number of physical sites associated with the entity. Activities performed in a personal context, such as breast feeding or donating breast milk to the child of a friend or relative, while respecting the principle of voluntary and unpaid donation, should not be considered as SoHO activities. However, if such activities were to be carried out repeatedly as a service for multiple persons, or for many families, they should be considered as SoHO activities and should fall under the scope of this Regulation.</p>

When SoHO are prepared with newly developed and validated collection, testing or processing methods, safety and effectiveness in SoHO recipients should be demonstrated by means of clinical-outcome data collection and review.

In the case of low risk and a positive benefit-risk assessment, in addition to the mandatory continuous vigilance reporting, the applicant should organise proactive clinical follow-up for a defined number of SoHO recipients. For moderate risk and a positive benefit-risk assessment, in addition to the mandatory vigilance reporting and the clinical follow-up, the applicant should propose a SoHO clinical study with monitoring of pre-defined clinical end-points. In the case of high risk and a positive benefit-risk assessment, and cases where the risk or the benefit are not evaluable due to a lack of scientific and clinical data or knowledge, SoHO clinical studies should include a comparison with a standard therapy, ideally in a study with SoHO recipients allocated to test and control groups in a randomised manner. The SoHO competent authority should approve the plans before they are implemented and should assess the outcome data as part of a SoHO preparation authorisation. In SoHO clinical studies, patients’ rights, safety, dignity and well-being should always be the priority and the SoHO clinical study should be designed in a way that leads to reliable and robust data and conclusions.</p>

They address issues of quality and safety beyond the risks of communicable disease transmission, such as SoHO donor eligibility criteria for the prevention of the transmission of cancer and other non-communicable diseases and the assurance of quality and safety during collection, processing, storage and distribution or export. It should therefore be possible to use those technical guidelines as one of the means to implement the standards provided for in this Regulation. Within the financial framework partnership agreement between the Union and the Council of Europe, the Commission supports the EDQM with multi-year contribution agreements in order to effectively contribute to the development and update of technical guidelines on quality and safety of SoHO.

SoHO should be obtained from persons whose health status is such that no detrimental effects will ensue as a result of the donation. This Regulation should therefore include standards and technical rules to monitor and protect living SoHO donors. This is particularly important where the donation involves significant risk to the SoHO donor’s health, such as where there is a need for pre-treatment with medicinal products, for example in the case of donation of oocytes or of hematopoietic stem cells from peripheral blood, a medical intervention to collect the SoHO, for example in the case of donation of bone marrow, or the possibility for SoHO donors to donate frequently, for example in the case of donation of plasma. As different types of donation entail different risks for SoHO donors, with varying levels of significance, the monitoring of the SoHO donor’s health should be proportionate to those levels of risk.</p>

The use of financial incentives for SoHO donations can have an impact on the quality and safety of SoHO, posing risks to the health of both SoHO donors and recipients and therefore to the protection of human health. Without affecting the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy, and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care, SoHO donation should be voluntary and unpaid, and be founded on the principles of altruism of the SoHO donor and solidarity between donor and recipient. Such solidarity should be built from the local and regional levels up to the national and Union levels, aiming for self-sufficiency of critical SoHO, and spreading the responsibility for donation evenly across the Union population to the extent possible. Voluntary and unpaid SoHO donation contributes to the respect for human dignity and to protecting the most vulnerable persons in society. It also contributes to high safety standards for SoHO and therefore to the protection of human health, increasing public trust in donation systems.</p>

Therefore, compensation to remove any such risk is deemed appropriate as long as it endeavours to guarantee financial neutrality and does not result in a financial gain for the SoHO donor or constitute an incentive that would cause a SoHO donor to not disclose relevant aspects of their medical or behavioural history or to donate in any way that could pose risks to their own health and to that of prospective recipients, in particular by donating more frequently than is allowed. It should be possible for compensation to consist of the reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with SoHO donation or of making good of any losses, preferably based on quantifiable criteria, associated with the donation of SoHO. Whatever the form of compensation, including through financial and non-financial means, compensation schemes should not result in competition between SoHO entities for SoHO donors, including cross-border competition and in particular between SoHO entities collecting SoHO for different purposes, such as the manufacture of medicinal products versus human application as a SoHO preparation. The setting of an upper limit for compensation at national level and the application of compensation that is financially neutral for the SoHO donor have the effect of removing any incentive for SoHO donors to donate to one SoHO entity rather than another, significantly mitigating the risk that compensation differences might result in competition between SoHO entities, in particular between public and private sectors. It should be possible for Member States to delegate the setting of such conditions to independent bodies, in accordance with national law. Prospective SoHO donors should be able to receive information regarding the possibility of having their expenses reimbursed or of receiving compensation for other losses, through information tools, such as website ‘Question and Answer’ pages, information email addresses, telephone lines or other such neutral channels of factual information dissemination. However, because of the risk of undermining the voluntary and unpaid character of SoHO donation, references to compensation schemes should not be included in advertising, promotion and publicity activities that form part of SoHO donor recruitment campaigns, for example using advertising billboards or posters, on television, newspaper, magazine or social media advertisements or similar.</p>

The aim of those campaigns should be to ensure the broadest possible SoHO donor base, with a view to a more resilient supply of critical SoHO, and help European citizens to decide whether to become SoHO donors during their lifetime and record or let their families or legal representatives know their wishes regarding donation of SoHO after death. As there is a need to ensure the availability of SoHO for medical treatments, Member States and the Union should support the establishment of public donation facilities and promote the voluntary and unpaid donation of SoHO, including plasma, of high quality and safety, thereby also increasing self-sufficiency in the Union. For that purpose, Member States should consider taking measures to ensure availability and accessibility of SoHO within the Union. Member States are also urged to take steps to encourage a strong involvement of all relevant sectors, both public and non-profit, in the provision of SoHO services, in particular for critical SoHO and the related research and development, and to take steps to promote affordability of the collected SoHO within the Union.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as having been one of the biggest health crises that has affected Europe. It had an adverse impact on the resilience of the SoHO donor base in some countries whose collection systems rely on a small number of persons donating SoHO more frequently than elsewhere. This crisis highlighted the vulnerabilities of the Union in very different aspects, ranging from the lack of coordination between Member States, which is essential to addressing such situations, to the Union’s strong dependence on third countries for developing medical treatments. In the case of SoHO, the pandemic drastically reduced the number of SoHO donors and imports from third countries, putting the Union in a situation of shortages of some SoHO and patients at serious risk due to a lack of adequate treatments. In that context, the initiatives for a strong European Health Union should work in favour of European self-sufficiency, in particular as regards the supply of critical SoHO and the ability to minimise the risk of shortages. The lessons learned and the resulting measures taken at Union level should serve as a reference for the prevention, detection and resolution of future health crises. Regulation (EU) 2022/2371 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc12-L_202401938EN.000101-E0012" href="#ntr12-L_202401938EN.000101-E0012"

National SoHO emergency plans contribute to European self-sufficiency in terms of supply of critical SoHO. Providing training and better information for prescribers would reduce the risk of unnecessary human application of SoHO. Furthermore, it is important that Member States improve patients’ safety by minimising the risks associated with human application of SoHO, and improve patient outcomes, while at the same time ensuring sufficiency of SoHO supplies and reducing financial pressure on healthcare systems of Member States. Some Member States do so, inter alia, via the Patient Blood Management (PBM) approach as endorsed by the World Health Organization.</p>

For certain SoHO that need to be matched between the SoHO donor and the SoHO recipient, such exchanges are essential to allow SoHO recipients to receive the treatment they need in the optimal timeframe. This is for instance the case of hematopoietic stem cell transplants, for which the level of compatibility between the SoHO donor and the SoHO recipient has to be high, which requires coordination at a global level, so that each SoHO recipient has as many options as possible to identify a compatible SoHO donor.</p>

The SCB should keep a SoHO compendium of the opinions issued by the SCB or the SoHO competent authorities and of decisions made at Member State level, so that SoHO competent authorities considering the regulatory status of a particular substance, product or activity are able to inform their decision-making process by referring to that SoHO compendium. The SCB should also document agreed best practices to support a common Union approach. It should also cooperate with similar Union level bodies established in other Union legislation with a view to facilitating coordinated and coherent application of this Regulation between Member States and across bordering legislative frameworks. The Commission should support the SCB in its cooperation with similar advisory bodies responsible for issuing an opinion on the regulatory status of products under other relevant Union legislation, in particular by organising meetings, at least annually.

Those measures should promote a coherent cross-sectoral approach and facilitate SoHO innovation.</p>
