High and constantly increasing quantities of packaging generated, as well as low levels of re-use and collection and poor recycling, present significant barriers to achieving a low-carbon circular economy. This Regulation should therefore establish rules covering the entire life-cycle of packaging, contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market by harmonising national measures, while preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of packaging and packaging waste on the environment and human health. By laying down measures in line with the waste hierarchy set out in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc3-L_202500040EN.000101-E0003" href="#ntr3-L_202500040EN.000101-E0003"

As stated in the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, set out in the communication of the Commission of 16 January 2018, the CEAP commits to increase uptake of recycled plastics and contribute to the more sustainable use of plastics. The Union budget and the system of own resources contribute to reducing pollution from plastic packaging waste.

However, in light of the disposal behaviour of consumers regarding tea and coffee bags as well as coffee or tea system single-serve units, which, in practice, are disposed of together with the product residue, leading to the contamination of compostable and recycling streams, those specific items should be treated as packaging. That approach is in line with the objective to increase the separate collection of bio-waste, as required by Article 22 of Directive 2008/98/EC, and ensures coherence regarding end-of-life financial and operational obligations. Paints, inks, varnishes, lacquers and adhesives that have been applied directly on a product should not be considered to be packaging. However, labels hung directly on or affixed to a product, including sticky labels affixed to fruits and vegetables, should be considered to be packaging, since, while the glue on the label is adhesive, the label itself is not. Furthermore, if a given material represents only an insignificant part of a packaging unit, and in any event no more than 5 % of the total mass of the packaging unit, such a packaging unit should not be considered to be composite packaging.

Regarding PFAS tonnage, food-contact material and packaging is one of the most relevant sectors. All PFAS within the scope of this Regulation are either very persistent themselves or degrade into very persistent PFAS in the environment. When looking specifically at those human health endpoints that are considered to be of most concern following long-term exposure of humans, i.e. carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity, including effects on or via lactation, and specific target organ toxicity, a large number of PFAS have a classification for at least one of those endpoints. Based on the physical properties of PFAS, particularly their persistence, together with the identified effects on health of some PFAS, PFAS represent an environmental and human health hazard.</p>

Due to the non-threshold nature of the PFAS hazards, exposure to PFAS from food-contact materials is an unacceptable risk for human health. PFAS should therefore be restricted in food-contact packaging. In order to avoid overlaps with restrictions on the use of PFAS laid down in other Union legal acts, the Commission should carry out an evaluation to assess the need to amend or repeal the restriction of PFAS in food-contact packaging laid down in this Regulation.</p>

Substances in packaging and in packaging components are therefore restricted at source and primarily addressed under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down under Title VIII of that Regulation, in order to protect human health and the environment along all stages of the life-cycle of the substance, including the waste stage. Hence, it should be recalled that Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 applies to the adoption or amendment of restrictions on substances manufactured for use or used in the production of packaging or packaging components as well as on the placing on the market of substances present in packaging or packaging components. As regards packaging that falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, it should be recalled that that Regulation aims to ensure a high level of protection of the consumers of packaged food.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Packaging that is designed with the objective of its recycling, once it becomes packaging waste, is one of the most efficient ways to improve packaging circularity and raise packaging recycling rates and the use of recycled content in packaging. Industry, through voluntary industry schemes, and some Member States have established packaging design for recycling criteria for a number of packaging formats for the purpose of the modulation of extended producer responsibility fees. In order to prevent barriers on the internal market and to provide industry with a level playing field, and with the objective to promote the sustainability of packaging, it is important to set mandatory requirements regarding the recyclability of packaging by harmonising the criteria and the methodology for assessing packaging recyclability based on a design for recycling methodology at Union level. In order to meet the objective set out in the CEAP that, by 2030, all packaging should be recyclable in an economically viable manner, recyclable packaging should be designed for material recycling and, when it becomes waste, be capable of being collected separately, sorted into specific waste streams without affecting the recyclability of other waste streams and recycled at scale. Packaging recyclability should be expressed in recyclability performance grades established on the basis of design for recycling criteria from 2030 and on the basis of both design for recycling and recycled-at-scale criteria from 2035 for packaging categories as listed in Annex II and expressed in grades A, B or C. Packaging of those grades should be considered to be recyclable and, consequently, be allowed to be placed on the market. Packaging below grade C should be considered to be technically non-recyclable and the placing on the market of such packaging should be restricted. However, packaging should comply with those criteria only from 1 January 2030 in order to give sufficient time to the economic operators to adapt. From 1 January 2038, packaging should be at least grade B in order to be placed on the market.</p>

The recycled material can be recycled multiple times. To enable the production of high-quality recycled raw materials, the collection of properly sorted packaging waste is crucial. The difference between material recycling and high-quality recycling is that in material recycling the packaging material is recycled into materials, while in high-quality recycling the packaging material is recycled into materials of such quality that those materials can be used as the same quality grade for packaging or for other applications where the quality of the recycled material is retained.</p>

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish a uniform methodology and a chain of custody mechanism that ensures that the packaging waste is effectively recycled at scale, based on established state-of-the-art separate collection processes and on established sorting and recycling processes that have been proven in an operational environment. Consequently, from 2035, a new assessment should be carried out based on the quantity, i.e. the weight, of the material effectively recycled from each of the packaging categories according to the methodology and thresholds set in this Regulation. The thresholds for recycled at scale should be set taking into account the target for the annual quantity of recycled material provided for in this Regulation. By 2030, Member States are expected to have already reported to the Commission the first data on quantities of packaging waste recycled by packaging category for the purposes of monitoring. The producers, in the case of individual fulfilment of extended producer responsibility obligations, the producer responsibility organisations entrusted with the fulfilment of those obligations or the packaging waste management operators, in the case where public authorities are responsible for the organisation of the management of packaging waste, should make sure that the packaging waste is collected separately, sorted and that the material is recycled in installed infrastructure, using established processes that have been proven in an operational environment, and should provide the manufacturer with all the technical documentation demonstrating that packaging is recycled at scale.</p>

Such initiatives taken at the national level can create regulatory uncertainty for economic operators, in particular those that supply packaging in several Member States. At the same time, the modulation of extended producer responsibility fees is an effective economic instrument to incentivise more sustainable packaging design leading to more easily recyclable packaging while improving the functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to harmonise criteria for the modulation of extended producer responsibility fees based on the recyclability performance grade obtained through the recyclability assessment, while not setting the actual amounts of such fees. As the criteria should be related to the criteria on packaging recyclability, it is appropriate to empower the Commission to adopt such harmonised criteria at the same time as establishing the detailed design for recycling criteria per packaging category.</p>

The increased use of recycled materials supports the development of the circular economy with well-functioning markets for recycled materials, reduces costs, dependencies and negative environmental impacts related to the use of primary raw materials, and allows for a more resource-efficient use of materials. In relation to the different packaging materials, the lowest input of recycled materials is in plastic packaging. In order to address these concerns in the most appropriate manner, it is necessary to increase the uptake of recycled plastics by establishing mandatory targets for recycled content in plastic packaging at different levels depending on the contact-sensitivity <a id="ntc21-L_202500040EN.000101-E0021" href="#ntr21-L_202500040EN.000101-E0021"

First, climate change is a global phenomenon that has no boundaries and its effects do not have a direct connection to the source of the emissions of greenhouse gases: countries with low emissions of greenhouse gases can experience effects of climate change that are disproportionate to their individual contributions to the global emissions of greenhouse gases. Second, water systems are interconnected, for example via oceanic currents, and past experience shows that pollution, including plastic waste pollution, happening in one part of the planet can spread widely to other oceans and continents. Third, emissions into the soil can have not only local, but also transboundary effects, especially when those emissions pass into the watercourses. The promotion of the use of recycled content in plastic packaging is based on the premise that the recycled content itself was produced in an environmentally sustainable way, so that the carbon footprint is reduced and the circular economy is encouraged. To that end, certain safeguards need to be put in place in order to ensure that the way in which recycled content is obtained does not cancel out the environmental benefits of using such recycled content in subsequent plastic packaging. It is therefore necessary to address the related environmental concerns in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to both domestically produced and imported plastic packaging. To that end, imports into the Union should be subject to equivalent conditions with regard to emissions and separate collection and sustainability criteria for recycling technologies.</p>

Moving closer to a ‘recycling society’ helps to avoid waste generation and encourages the use of waste as a resource, while avoiding locking in resources at the lower levels of the waste hierarchy with detrimental effects on the environment and disregarding environmentally sound management of waste. Separate collection also avoids mixing hazardous and non-hazardous waste, ensuring the safety of the waste and of its shipment, and avoids pollution, as provided by international rules such as the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal <a id="ntc22-L_202500040EN.000101-E0022" href="#ntr22-L_202500040EN.000101-E0022"

They also demonstrated the will of the contracting parties to adopt measures in that direction. The Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution <a id="ntc24-L_202500040EN.000101-E0024" href="#ntr24-L_202500040EN.000101-E0024"

                           <p class="oj-normal">The environmental objective of encouraging the use of materials recovered from post-consumer plastic waste requires plastic recycling to be done in a way that minimises the resulting pollution. If this does not occur, the industrial pollutants emitted in the course of recycling would reduce or eliminate the environmental added value of encouraging the use of recycled plastic. Sustainability criteria should be developed with regard to recycling technologies for post-consumer plastic waste. They should ensure a high level of protection of environment and human health, in particular with regard to the level of emissions into the air, water and soil, and to resource efficiency. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of establishing sustainability criteria for plastic recycling technologies. Accordingly, recycling should be performed in an environmentally sound manner, leading to the high quality of recycling processes and products and ensuring high standards for the recycling sector. By ensuring the appropriate level of sustainability of the recycling technology and, consequently, the recyclate, the encouragement of the use of recycled content in plastic packaging becomes an environmentally responsible measure. Discussions during the meetings of the INC on Plastic Pollution also stressed the importance of ensuring that recycling technologies operate in an environmentally sound manner.</p>

In light of that concern, Member States should specify the appropriate waste management on their territory for compostable packaging. As the proper disposal route for compostable plastic packaging is becoming increasingly confusing for consumers, it is justified and necessary to lay down clear and common rules on the use of compostable plastic packaging, mandating it only when its use brings a clear benefit for the environment or for human health. This is particularly the case when the use of compostable packaging helps collect or dispose of bio-waste, for example for products where the separation between the content and packaging is particularly complex, such as tea bags.</p>

The manufacturer should assess the packaging against the performance criteria listed in this Regulation. In view of the objectives of this Regulation to reduce packaging and packaging waste generation, and to improve circularity of packaging across the internal market, it is appropriate to further supplement and clarify the current criteria and to make them more stringent. The list of the packaging performance criteria, as listed in harmonised standard EN 13428:2004 ‘Packaging – Requirements specific to manufacturing and composition – Prevention by source reduction’, should therefore be modified. However, until such time as a new or updated harmonised standard becomes available, the existing standard, EN 13428:2004, can be used. While marketing and consumer acceptance remain relevant for packaging design, they should not be part of performance criteria justifying on their own additional packaging weight and volume. However, this should not compromise product specifications for craft and industrial products and food and agricultural products that are registered and protected under the EU geographical indication protection scheme, as part of the Union’s objective to protect cultural heritage and traditional know-how, including under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc28-L_202500040EN.000101-E0028" href="#ntr28-L_202500040EN.000101-E0028"

It should also not compromise packaging designs that are protected under Union or national law on design or trademarks or international agreements having effect in one of the Member States. The exception of such packaging is justified only to the extent that the new rules on packaging minimisation affect the shape of the packaging in such a way that the trademark can no longer distinguish the trademarked good from goods of another undertaking, and the design can no longer keep its new and individual characteristics. In order to avoid the risk of abuse, the exception should apply only to trademark and design rights protected before 11 February 2025. On the other hand, recyclability, the use of recycled content and re-use of packaging could justify additional packaging weight or volume and should be added to the performance criteria. Packaging with double walls, false bottoms and other characteristics aimed only at increasing the perceived product volume should not be placed on the market, as such packaging does not meet the requirement for packaging minimisation. The same rule should apply to superfluous packaging not necessary for ensuring packaging functionality.</p>

The symbols should enable appropriate waste management as they should provide consumers with information about the composting properties of such packaging. Such information should, in particular, avoid consumer confusion regarding compostable packaging, which is not, as such, suitable for home composting, but only compostable in industrially controlled conditions. Such information should therefore prevent compostable packaging from being thrown away in nature. That approach will improve the separate collection of packaging waste, leading to higher quality recycling of packaging waste, and is intended to introduce a level of harmonisation of the packaging waste collection systems on the internal market. It is also necessary to harmonise symbols associated with the mandatory deposit and return systems established after the entry into force of this Regulation. It should be possible for Member States to require the use of such harmonised labels on packaging subject to deposit and return systems established under national law before the entry into force of this Regulation. Considering that transport packaging is not collected through municipal waste collection systems, the use of those symbols should not be mandatory for transport packaging, with the exception of the e-commerce packaging.</p>

That data carrier should comply with the requirements under this Regulation or other applicable Union law. In particular, where the packaged product is covered by Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 or other Union law requiring a digital product passport, that digital product passport should also be used for providing the relevant information under this Regulation. Where packaging contains substances of concern, it should be marked using a standardised, open, digital-marking technology as established in implementing acts adopted by the Commission. That information should ensure that waste operators have access to relevant information on the chemical composition of the packaging to determine the most appropriate waste management option in line with the waste hierarchy, thus promoting packaging circularity.</p>

The most appropriate manner to achieve this is to oblige economic operators who use reusable packaging to ensure that a re-use system is put in place, thus allowing such packaging to circulate, rotate and be used repeatedly. To maximise the benefits of such systems, minimum requirements should be laid down for open loop and closed loop systems. Confirmation of compliance of reusable packaging with a re-use system should also be a part of the technical documentation of such packaging. Re-use systems can vary in size and geographical coverage and range from smaller local systems to larger systems that may span over one or several Member States’ territory.</p>

This was appraised based on factors such as existing re-use systems, necessity of using packaging and the possibility of fulfilling the functional requirements in terms of containment, tidiness, health, hygiene and safety. Differences of the products and their production and distribution systems were also taken into account. The implementation of such targets should take into account the environmental benefits achieved throughout the whole life-cycle of a product. The setting of the targets is expected to support innovation and increase the proportion of re-use packaging and refill solutions. Single-use plastic packaging for food and beverages filled and consumed within the premises in the HORECA sector should not be allowed. Consumers should always have the option to purchase food and beverages for take-away in reusable or their own containers under conditions that are no less favourable than those applicable to food and beverages offered in single-use packaging. Economic operators selling food or beverages for take-away should offer consumers the option to purchase the food or beverages in their own containers and the option to purchase food and beverages in reusable packaging.</p>

The same obligation should, for the same reasons, apply to economic operators transporting products within one Member State. For certain types of transport or sales packaging, reusable alternatives are not an option. This is the case for cardboard boxes, where the number of rotations is very low, and for packaging used for certain contact-sensitive products, which require special washing between uses.

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">36</span>)</a>. In view of the current divergent approaches and limited reporting requirements on the plastic carrier bags, it is difficult to assess whether the consumption reduction measures taken by the Member States have achieved the objective of a ‘sustained’ reduction in the consumption of such bags, and also if they have not increased the consumption of other types of plastic carrier bags. It is therefore necessary to harmonise a definition of sustained reduction in the consumption of plastic carrier bags and set a common target as well as introduce new reporting requirements.</p>

As products, materials and consumption patterns have evolved, there has been a significant rise in the use of single-use packaging, especially single-use plastic. This is linked to the retail landscape, with larger distribution networks, manufacturing and packing products on high-speed packaging lines, which exert a combined downward pressure on the market for re-use and refill.</p>

Meeting a target of 5 % reduction of packaging waste by 2030 compared to 2018 should entail an overall absolute reduction of approximately 19 % on average across the Union in 2030 compared to the 2030 baseline scenario. In order to ensure that the reduction efforts continue beyond 2030, a reduction target of 10 % compared to 2018 should be set for 2035; this is estimated to reduce packaging waste by 29 % compared to the 2035 baseline scenario. An additional reduction target of 15 % compared to 2018 should also be set for 2040; this is estimated to reduce packaging waste by 37 % compared to the 2040 baseline scenario. In order to support Member States in achieving the packaging waste prevention targets, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish a correction factor to account for the increase or decrease in tourism in relation to the base year 2018. As the generation of commercial and industrial packaging waste is not related to household consumption, the waste prevention targets per capita cannot apply as such to commercial and industrial packaging waste. Member States which have established a different system for the management of household packaging waste, on one hand, and of industrial and commercial packaging waste, on the other, should be able to retain their specificity.</p>

Such measures should be adopted in parallel and in addition to other measures under this Regulation that aim to reduce packaging and packaging waste, such as requirements on packaging minimisation, re-use targets and refill obligations, volume thresholds and measures to achieve the sustained reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. It should be possible for Member States, while observing the general rules laid down in the TFEU and acting in accordance with this Regulation, to adopt provisions which go beyond the minimum waste prevention targets set out in this Regulation. When implementing such measures, Member States should be aware of the risk of a shift from heavier to lighter packaging materials and should prioritise measures that minimise that risk.</p>

To that end, this Regulation builds on the extended producer responsibility requirements laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC in order to ensure that the extended producer responsibility scheme covers the full waste management costs of packaging and to facilitate adequate controls by the competent authorities. This Regulation seeks to clearly define one producer per packaging unit, whether it is for empty packaging or for packaging containing products. As a general rule, the producer should be the economic operator who, as a manufacturer, importer or distributor established in a Member State, makes available packaged products from within the territory of that Member State and on that same territory. This includes any offer for distribution, consumption or use which could result in actual supply. Thus, where a company buys a packaged product from another Member State other than that where the company is located, or from a third country, and supplies that packaged product in the Member State where it is located, that company should be considered to be the producer, as it is the first company making the packaged product available on the territory of that Member State. With regard to online platforms, the initial offering of a product should be considered as being made available in the sense of the producer definition. However, to minimise any unnecessary administrative burden for small businesses that fill transport packaging, primary production packaging or service packaging, whether as a single-use packaging or as reusable packaging, at the point of sale, the producer should be the manufacturer, distributor or importer of such packaging that makes the packaging available for the first time from within the territory of the Member State, since that economic operator is best placed to comply with the extended producer responsibility obligations.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">On the other hand, when the packaging or the packaged product is made available by means of distance contracts directly to the end user, the producer could also be established in another Member State or in a third country. In such cases, if the producer is established in another Member State, it should appoint an authorised representative for the extended producer responsibility in the Member State where the end user is located. In cases where the producer is established in a third country, it should also be possible for Member States to provide that the appointment of an authorised representative for the extended producer responsibility be mandatory in order to avoid the risk of eluding the extended producer responsibility obligations. In order to ensure respect for the polluter pays principle, and in the context of compliance with extended producer responsibility, it is necessary to ensure certainty as to which kind of producer is responsible for packaging waste, in particular in the case of ‘logistics companies’. Logistics companies are companies that receive imported goods from third countries and that conduct handling activities regarding the imported goods (e.g. unpacking and repacking into smaller formats or quantities to comply with clients’ requests) before sending the goods to clients, whether in the same or another Member State, with all, part of or without the original transport packaging. In such cases, a producer should be identified for the original transport packaging that comes from a third country, remains with the logistics company and becomes waste in the Union. Typically, the logistics company will not have ownership of the goods, but should be considered as the producer for packaging that comes from a third country and that it handles during its activity.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In line with the polluter pays principle, it is essential that the producers, including e-commerce actors, that place packaging and packaged products on the Union market, or unpack packaged products without being end users, take responsibility for the management of that packaging and those packaged products at their end-of-life. Extended producer responsibility schemes are to be established, as provided for in Directive 94/62/EC, by 31 December 2024, as they are the most appropriate means to achieve this and can have a positive environmental impact by reducing the generation of packaging waste and increasing the collection and recycling of packaging waste. There are wide disparities in the way extended producer responsibility schemes are set up, in their efficiency and in the scope of responsibility of producers. The rules on extended producer responsibility laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC should therefore, in general, apply to extended producer responsibility schemes for producers under this Regulation, and be complemented by further specific provisions where this is necessary and appropriate. For example, in order to facilitate the separate collection of packaging waste, the producers should finance the labelling of waste receptacles. Such an obligation would be in line with the polluter pays principle and the general minimum requirements for extended producer responsibility schemes established under Directive 2008/98/EC.</p>

Member States can authorise multiple producer responsibility organisations, as competition among them may lead to greater consumer benefits.

However, it is not yet appropriate to amend the targets set for 2030, as evidence shows that some Member States still have difficulties to meet the existing targets. For that reason, measures encouraging manufacturers to place on the market more recyclable packaging, and thereby helping Member States to achieve the recycling targets, should be set up. In the future, more granular data on packaging and packaging waste recycling flows should be reported to the Commission. The reporting of that data will enable the Commission to review the targets with the possibility of maintaining or increasing them. In order to take account of the effect of the measures aimed at improving the packaging recyclability, the review should not take place earlier than the envisaged general evaluation of this Regulation, that is 7 years after its entry into force. During that review, attention should also be paid to the possibility of introducing new targets on a more granular basis than the current targets.</p>

Member States should ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data gathered on recycled packaging waste. As a general rule, the actual measurement of the weight of packaging waste to be counted as recycled should be at the point where packaging waste enters the recycling operation. Nevertheless, in order to limit the administrative burden, Member States should, under strict conditions and by way of derogation from the general rule, be allowed to establish the weight of packaging waste recycled on the basis of measuring the output of any sorting operation, to be corrected by taking into account average loss rates occurring before the waste enters the recycling operations. Losses of materials which occur before the waste enters the recycling operation, for instance due to sorting or other preliminary operations, should not be included in the quantities of waste reported as recycled. Those losses can be established on the basis of electronic registries, technical specifications, detailed rules on the calculation of average loss rates for various waste streams or other equivalent measures. Member States should include information on such measures in the quality check reports accompanying the data which they submit to the Commission on waste recycling. The average loss rates should preferably be established at the level of individual sorting facilities and should be linked to the main different types of waste, different sources (such as household or commercial), different collection schemes and different types of sorting processes. Average loss rates should only be used in cases where no other reliable data are available, in particular in the context of shipment and export of waste. Losses in weight of materials or substances due to physical or chemical transformation processes inherent in the recycling operation where packaging waste is actually reprocessed into products, materials or substances should not be deducted from the weight of the waste reported as recycled.</p>

Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 setting out a horizontal framework for market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market should apply to packaging for which sustainability requirements are set pursuant to this Regulation. The market surveillance mechanisms laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 sets out the requirements for market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and provides for safeguard mechanisms to check compliance with this Regulation in respect of placing packaging on the market.</p>

The requirements should be transparent, objective and non-discriminatory. It should be possible for Member States to refer to technical specifications, selection criteria or contract performance conditions in their public procurement requirements and it should not be necessary for those requirements to be cumulative.

Priority should be given to cooperation in the market between market surveillance authorities and economic operators. Therefore, whereas they may concern any packaging entering the Union market, interventions by authorities designated pursuant to Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should focus primarily on packaging subject to prohibition measures taken by market surveillance authorities. Where they take such prohibition measures, and the prohibition measures are not restricted to the national territory, market surveillance authorities should communicate to authorities designated for the controls on packaging entering the Union market the details necessary for the identification of such non-compliant packaging at the borders, including information on the packaged products and the economic operators, to enable a risk-based approach for products entering the Union market. In such cases, customs will aim at identifying and stopping this packaging at the borders.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">This Regulation establishes general rules that apply to all packaging. However, certain single-use plastic products covered by Directive (EU) 2019/904, such as plastic carrier bags, beverage cups, food and beverage containers, including bottles, are considered to be packaging. Directive (EU) 2019/904 is a <span class="oj-italic">lex specialis</span> in relation to this Regulation. In the event of a conflict between Directive (EU) 2019/904 and this Regulation, Directive (EU) 2019/904 should prevail within the scope of its application. Directive (EU) 2019/904 requires Member States to take measures to reduce the consumption of certain single-use plastic products, including marketing restrictions. Such marketing restrictions should apply and prevail over any conflicting provisions in this Regulation. This Regulation provides a restriction on the placing on the market of plastic products listed in Annex V point 3 thereto, while Directive (EU) 2019/904 allows the Member States to take the necessary measures to achieve reduction in the consumption of those single-use plastic products. Since national implementing measures under Directive (EU) 2019/904 can be less restrictive than a ban on the placing on the market, this Regulation should prevail over Directive (EU) 2019/904 as regards such products falling within the definition of packaging, in order to boost the reduction of single-use plastic packaging and reduce the quantity of single-use plastic packaging in the environment. As a consequence, it should not be possible for Member States to adopt an exemption from the ban in Directive (EU) 2019/904 on placing packaging made of expanded polystyrene on the market. To reflect this, Directive (EU) 2019/904 should be amended accordingly.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">From 2030, recyclability performance is based on design for recycling criteria. The design for recycling criteria shall ensure the circularity of the use of the resulting secondary raw materials of sufficient quality to substitute the primary raw materials.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The assessment based on design for recycling criteria shall be carried out for each packaging category listed in Table 1, taking into account the methodology established under Article 6(4) and the related delegated acts, as well as the parameters established in Table 4. After weighing the criteria per packaging unit, it will be classified into categories A, B or C. When a packaging unit’s recyclability performance grade is below 70 %, it is considered to be non-compliant with the recyclability performance grades and therefore the packaging will be considered technically non-recyclable and its placing on the market shall be restricted.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">From 2035, a new factor shall be added to the assessment of the packaging recyclability, which is the recycled-at-scale assessment. Consequently, a new assessment shall be carried out based on the quantity (weight) of the material effectively recycled from each of the packaging categories in accordance with the methodology established in the implementing acts adopted under Article 6(5). The thresholds related to the annual recycled packaging materials for compliance with the recycled-at-scale assessment shall be defined taking into account the targets set in Article 3(1), point (39).</p>
