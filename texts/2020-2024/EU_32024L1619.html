Risks of conflicts of interest undermine the integrity of the Union financial system and harm the goal of an integrated banking and capital markets union. Directive 2013/36/EU should lay down more detailed provisions for Member States to ensure that the competent authorities, including their members of staff and the members of their governance bodies, act independently and objectively. In that context, minimum requirements should be laid down to prevent conflicts of interest and limit ‘revolving doors’, providing, in particular, for cooling-off periods, a prohibition on trading instruments issued by supervised entities, and a maximum tenure period for relevant members of governance bodies. EBA should issue guidelines addressed to competent authorities on the prevention of conflicts of interest which are based on international best practices.</p>

The requirement to establish a branch in the Union should not apply to cases of reverse solicitation, that is where a client or counterparty approaches an undertaking established in a third country at its own exclusive initiative for the provision of banking services, including their continuation, or banking services closely related to those originally solicited. When transposing this Directive, Member States should be able to take measures to preserve clients’ acquired rights under existing contracts. Such measures should apply solely for the purpose of facilitating the transition to implementation of this Directive, and should be narrowly framed to avoid instances of circumvention. To prevent the circumvention of the rules applicable to the cross-border provision of banking services by third-country undertakings, competent authorities should be able to monitor the provision of those services.

In such a situation, a credit institution should be wound up in accordance with the applicable national insolvency proceedings, or with other types of proceedings laid down for those institutions under national law, which would ensure its orderly exit from the market, and should therefore discontinue the activities for which the authorisation had been granted. However, there should be no automatic link between the failing or likely to fail determination and the withdrawal of the authorisation, as for other cases where the competent authority is entitled to withdraw the authorisation. Competent authorities should exercise their powers in a manner that is proportionate and that takes into consideration the features of the applicable national insolvency proceedings, including existing judicial procedures. The power to withdraw the authorisation should not be used to prevent the opening, or force the termination, of insolvency proceedings, such as the application of a judicial moratorium or other measures which are conditional upon an active licence.</p>

However, the power to exclude those entities from the perimeter of consolidation of a banking group should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances, where all the conditions set out in the applicable law are complied with and, to that end, the banking group concerned should demonstrate that the holding entity that should be excluded is not involved in, or relevant for, the management of that banking group.</p>

While third-country branches have a significant and increasing presence in Union banking markets, they are currently subject only to very general information requirements, but not to any Union-level prudential standards or supervisory cooperation arrangements. The complete absence of a common prudential framework leads to third-country branches being subject to disparate national requirements of varying levels of prudence and scope. Furthermore, competent authorities lack comprehensive information and the necessary supervisory tools to properly monitor the specific risks created by third-country groups operating in one or more Member States through branches and subsidiaries. There are currently no integrated supervisory arrangements in relation to them and the competent authority responsible for the supervision of each branch of a third-country group is not obliged to exchange information with the competent authorities supervising the other branches and subsidiaries of the same group. Such a fragmented regulatory landscape creates risks to financial stability and market integrity in the Union and should be properly addressed through a harmonised regulatory framework on third-country branches. Such a framework should comprise minimum common requirements on authorisation, prudential standards, internal governance, supervision and reporting. That set of requirements should build on those that Member States already apply to third-country branches in their territories and should take into account similar or equivalent requirements that third countries apply to foreign branches, in order to ensure consistency between Member States and align the Union’s regulatory framework for third-country branches with the prevailing international practices in this field.</p>

Before a third-country branch commences its activities in a Member State, competent authorities should endeavour to conclude an agreement with the supervisory authority of the third country concerned to enable cooperation and information exchange. Such an agreement should be based on the model administrative arrangements developed by EBA in accordance with Article 33(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Competent authorities should submit information about such agreements to EBA. Where the conclusion of an administrative agreement on the basis of the model developed by EBA is not possible, competent authorities should be able to use other arrangements, for example an exchange of letters, to ensure that they can exercise their supervisory functions.</p>

Third-country branches should, therefore, be classified as either class 1, where they are deemed riskier, or, otherwise, as class 2, where they are considered to be small and non-complex and not to pose a significant financial stability risk, consistent with the definition of ‘small and non-complex institution’ in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Accordingly, third-country branches with booked assets in a Member State in an amount equal to or greater than EUR 5 billion should be regarded as posing such a higher risk due to their larger size and complexity, because their failure could lead to a significant disruption of the banking services market or the banking system of the Member State. Third-country branches authorised to accept retail deposits should similarly be regarded as riskier regardless of their size where the amount of such retail deposits exceeds a certain threshold, insofar as their failure could affect highly vulnerable depositors and could lead to a loss of confidence in the safety and soundness of the banking system of the Member State and its ability to protect citizens’ savings. Both types of third-country branch should, therefore, be classified as class 1 third-country branches.</p>

Furthermore, EBA should also consult and cooperate closely with the third country’s supervisory authorities, the government departments in charge of its banking regulation and, where appropriate, private sector parties, endeavouring to treat those parties fairly and to give them the opportunity to submit documentation and make representations within reasonable timeframes. Furthermore, EBA should ensure that the report issued is adequately reasoned, sets out a detailed description of the matters assessed and is delivered within a reasonable timeframe. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt decisions on the equivalence of the banking regulatory frameworks of third-country branches. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc11-L_202401619EN.000101-E0011" href="#ntr11-L_202401619EN.000101-E0011"

Moreover, competent authorities should be required to assess whether third-country branches have systemic importance where the aggregate amount of the assets of all third-country branches in the Union which belong to the same third-country group is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion. All third-country branches that belong to the same third-country group established in one Member State or across the Union should be subject to such assessment by their respective competent authorities. That assessment should examine, in accordance with specific criteria, whether those branches pose an analogous level of risk to the financial stability of the Union or its Member States as institutions defined as ‘systemically important’ under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where competent authorities conclude that the third-country branches are systemically important, they should impose requirements on those branches that are appropriate to mitigate risks to financial stability. For those purposes, competent authorities should be able to require third-country branches to apply for authorisation as subsidiary institutions under Directive 2013/36/EU in order to continue conducting banking activities in the Member State or across the Union. Moreover, competent authorities should be able to impose other requirements, in particular an obligation to restructure third-country branches’ assets or activities in the Union so that those branches cease to have systemic importance, or a requirement to comply with additional capital, liquidity, reporting or disclosure requirements, where that would be sufficient to address the risks to financial stability. Competent authorities should have the possibility not to impose any of those requirements on third-country branches assessed as having systemic importance, in which case they should provide a reasoned notification to EBA and the competent authorities of the Member States where the relevant third-country group has established other third-country branches or subsidiary institutions. In order to consider the Union-wide implications, competent authorities which decide to exercise their power to require the authorisation as a subsidiary institution should, in advance, consult EBA and the competent authorities concerned.</p>

To facilitate the effective supervision of compliance with those requirements by third-country branches and to allow for a comprehensive overview of third-country groups’ activities within the Union, common supervisory and financial reporting should be made available to competent authorities in accordance with standardised templates. EBA should be mandated to develop draft implementing technical standards setting out those templates. Furthermore, in order to ensure that all the activities of third-country groups operating in the Union through third-country branches are subject to comprehensive supervision, to prevent the requirements applicable to those groups under Union law from being circumvented and to minimise potential risks to financial stability in the Union, it is necessary to implement appropriate cooperation arrangements between competent authorities. In particular, class 1 third-country branches should be included within the scope of the colleges of supervisors of third-country groups in the Union. Where such a college does not yet exist, competent authorities should set up an ad hoc college for all class 1 third-country branches of the same group where that group operates in more than one Member State.</p>

The same modelling approaches are also the basis for the expected credit losses calculation where institutions apply national accounting frameworks. As a result, it is important that competent authorities and EBA have a clear view of the impact that those calculations have on the range of values for risk-weighted assets and own funds requirements that arise for similar exposures. To that end, the benchmarking exercise should also cover those modelling approaches. Given that institutions calculating own funds requirements in accordance with the standardised approach for credit risk may also use models for the calculation of expected credit losses within the IFRS 9 framework, those institutions should also be included in the benchmarking exercise, taking into account the principle of proportionality.</p>

The financial system has a relevant role to play in supporting that transition, which relates not only to capturing and supporting the opportunities that will arise but also to properly managing the risks that it may entail.

In 2018, the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System acknowledged that climate-related risks are a source of financial risk. The communication of the Commission of 6 July 2021 entitled ‘Strategy for Financing the Transition to a Sustainable Economy’ (the ‘Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy’) emphasises that ESG risks, and risks arising from the physical impact of climate change, biodiversity loss and the broader environmental degradation of ecosystems in particular, pose an unprecedented challenge to the Union’s economy and to the stability of the financial system. Those risks present specificities such as their forward-looking nature and their distinctive impacts over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. The specificity of climate-related and other environmental risks, for example risks arising from environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, as regards both transition and physical risks, requires in particular the management of those risks with a long-term time horizon of at least 10 years.</p>

The adequate adjustment of the financial sector, and of credit institutions in particular, is necessary to achieve the objective of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the Union’s economy by 2050, while keeping the inherent risks under control. Competent authorities should, therefore, be enabled to assess that process of adjustment and to intervene in cases where institutions manage climate risks, as well as risks arising from environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, in a way that endangers the stability of the individual institutions, or financial stability overall. Competent authorities should also monitor and be empowered to act where there are risks arising from transition trends in the context of the relevant Union and Member States regulatory objectives in relation to ESG factors, for example as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc14-L_202401619EN.000101-E0014" href="#ntr14-L_202401619EN.000101-E0014"

Competent authorities should also be empowered to reinforce targets, measures and actions of institutions’ prudential plans where they are considered insufficient to address the ESG risks in the short-, medium- and long-term time horizon and could in that regard pose material risks to their solvability. Climate risks and, more broadly, environmental risks, should be considered together with social risks and governance risks under a single category of risk to enable a comprehensive and coordinated integration of those factors, as they are often intertwined. ESG risks are closely linked with the concept of sustainability, as ESG factors represent the three main pillars of sustainability.</p>

Institutions should be required to assess the alignment of their portfolios with the ambition of the Union to become climate-neutral by 2050 as well as avert environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Institutions should have the obligation to set out specific plans to address the financial risks arising, in the short, medium and long term, from ESG factors, including from transition trends in the context of the relevant regulatory objectives of the Union and Member States, for example as set out in the Paris Agreement, Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, the Fit for 55 package and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as, where relevant for internationally active institutions, third-country legal and regulatory objectives. Institutions should be required to have robust governance arrangements and internal processes for the management of ESG risks and to have in place strategies approved by their management bodies that take into consideration not only the current but also the forward-looking impact of ESG factors. The collective knowledge and awareness of ESG factors by institutions’ management bodies and internal capital allocation to address ESG risks will also be key to strengthening resilience to the negative impacts of those risks. The specificities of ESG risks mean that understanding, measurements and management practices can differ significantly across institutions. To ensure convergence across the Union and a uniform understanding of ESG risks, appropriate definitions and minimum standards for the assessment of those risks should be provided for in a prudential regulatory framework. To achieve that objective, definitions should be introduced in Directive 2013/36/EU and EBA should be empowered to specify a minimum set of reference methodologies for the assessment of the impact of ESG risks on the financial stability of institutions, giving priority to the impact of environmental factors. Since the forward-looking nature of ESG risks means that scenario analysis and stress testing, together with plans for addressing those risks, are particularly informative assessment tools, EBA should be also empowered to develop uniform criteria for the content of the plans to address those risks and for the setting of scenarios and the application of stress testing methods. EBA should base its scenarios on available scientific evidence, building on the work of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System and the efforts by the Commission to strengthen cooperation between all relevant public authorities with a view to developing a common methodological base, as outlined in the Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy. Environment-related risks, including climate-related risks and risks arising from environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, should take priority in light of their urgency and the particular relevance of scenario analysis and stress testing for their assessment.</p>

For the Union to deliver on its overall objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, institutions need to integrate into their policies and activities the role of promoting sustainable development. To cater for that process of integration, institutions’ business models and strategies must be tested against the relevant Union regulatory objectives for a sustainable economy, including, for example, against the measures prescribed by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change, to identify ESG risks arising from misalignments. Where institutions disclose their sustainability objectives and commitments under other mandatory or voluntary sustainability frameworks, such as under Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc15-L_202401619EN.000101-E0015" href="#ntr15-L_202401619EN.000101-E0015"

To promote sound and effective risk oversight as well as managerial behaviour aligned with their long-term strategy on sustainability, the risk appetite of institutions in relation to ESG risks should be an integral part of their remuneration policies and practices.</p>

To the extent that the institution’s competent authorities or designated authorities consider that risks related to climate change have the potential to have serious negative consequences for the financial system and the real economy in Member States, they should introduce a systemic risk buffer rate which could also be applied to certain sets or subsets of exposures, for instance to those subject to physical and transition risks related to climate change, where they consider that the introduction of such a rate is effective and proportionate to mitigate those risks.</p>

To address potential risks for institutions caused by their crypto-asset exposures that are not sufficiently covered by the existing prudential framework, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision developed a standard for the prudential treatment of crypto-asset exposures. Part of that standard concerns the risk management by institutions and the application of the supervisory review and evaluation process on institutions. Institutions with direct or indirect crypto-asset exposures or institutions that provide related services for any form of crypto-asset should be required to have risk management policies, processes and practices in place to appropriately manage risks caused by their crypto-asset exposures. In particular, in their risk management activities, institutions should consider the crypto-asset technology risks, general information and communication technology (ICT) and cyber risks, legal risks, money laundering and terrorist financing risks and valuation risks. Competent authorities should be able to take the necessary supervisory actions where the institutions’ risk management practices are deemed insufficient.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The purpose of assessing the suitability of members of management bodies is to ensure that those members are qualified for their role and are of good repute. Having a robust ‘fit-and-proper’ framework for assessing the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders is a crucial factor in ensuring that institutions are adequately run and their risks are appropriately managed. Existing rules do not ensure that there is a timely suitability assessment of members of the management body by the appointing institution. Furthermore, there are currently no rules for the suitability assessment of key function holders. Moreover, cross-border institutions must navigate through a wide diversity of national rules and processes, which reduces the efficiency of the current framework. The existence of considerably different requirements as regards the suitability assessment across the Union is a particularly relevant issue in the context of the banking union. As a result, it is important to lay down a set of rules at Union level to put in place a more consistent and predictable ‘fit-and-proper’ framework. This will foster supervisory convergence, further enable trust between competent authorities and provide more legal certainty to institutions. ‘Fit-and-proper’ assessments are an important supervisory element along with other mechanisms such as the supervisory review and evaluation process and remuneration rules that together ensure sound governance of institutions.</p>

Large institutions should in any event ensure that competent authorities receive an <span class="oj-italic">ex ante</span> suitability application at the latest 30 working days before the prospective member takes up the position. The <span class="oj-italic">ex ante</span> suitability application should be accompanied by all relevant documents and information that is necessary for the assessment, irrespective of whether the suitability assessment by the competent authorities is finalised before or after the person takes up the position. If criminal records or other documents required under national law or listed by competent authorities become available at a later stage, competent authorities should also receive those documents or information without undue delay. The <span class="oj-italic">ex ante</span> suitability application should enable the competent authorities to start their analysis and take action in the context of the assessment. Such action can include preventing the prospective member from taking up the position as long as the competent authority does not receive sufficient information, or engaging in an enhanced dialogue in case the competent authority has concerns regarding the prospective member’s suitability with a view to ensuring that the prospective member is or becomes suitable when taking up the position. EBA should issue guidelines on the modalities of the focused and in-depth dialogue between the competent authority and the large institution with a view to removing any obstacles regarding the suitability of the prospective member in a spirit of cooperation. The <span class="oj-italic">ex ante</span> suitability application should allow the competent authorities to engage in an early dialogue with large institutions on the suitability of members of the management body in its management function or the chair of the management body in its supervisory function before they take up their position.

Furthermore, upon the institution becoming bound by the output floor, the competent authority should review that institution’s additional own funds requirement and assess, in particular, whether and to what extent such requirements are already fully covered by the fact that the institution is bound by the output floor. Where that is the case, the institution’s additional own funds requirement should be regarded as overlapping with the risks captured by the output floor in the own funds requirement of the institution and, consequently, the competent authority should reduce that requirement to the extent necessary to remove any such overlap for as long as the institution remains bound by the output floor.</p>

In such cases, the institution’s competent authority or designated authority should review the calibration of the systemic risk buffer rates and make sure that they remain appropriate and do not double-count the risks that are already covered by virtue of the fact that the institution is bound by the output floor. Such a review should take place with the same frequency as the review of the buffers, which is annual for the O-SII buffer and every two years for the systemic risk buffer. However, it should be possible for the institution’s competent authority or designated authority to adjust the calibration of the buffers on a more frequent basis.</p>

Setting a systemic risk buffer should be possible for designated authorities in all Member States to ensure that authorities are empowered to address systemic risks in a timely, proportionate and effective manner and to enable the recognition of systemic risk buffer rates set by authorities in other Member States. Recognition of a systemic risk buffer rate set by another Member State should require only a notification from the authority recognising the rate. To avoid unnecessary authorisation procedures where the decision to set a buffer rate results in a decrease or no change from any of the previously set rates, the procedure laid down in Article 131(15) of Directive 2013/36/EU needs to be aligned with the procedure laid down in Article 133(9) of that Directive. The procedures laid down in Article 133(11) and (12) of that Directive should be clarified and made more consistent with the procedures applicable to other systemic risk buffer rates, where relevant.</p>
