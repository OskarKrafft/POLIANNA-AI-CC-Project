The assessment of progress achieved and the identification of shortcomings aim to provide incentives and guidance to the beneficiaries listed in Annex I to pursue the necessary far-reaching reforms. For the prospect of enlargement to become a reality, a firm commitment to ‘fundamentals first’ remains essential. The ‘fundamentals first’ approach links the rule of law and fundamental rights with the two other crucial areas of the accession process: economic governance – strengthened focus on economic development and improved competitiveness – and the strengthening of democratic institutions and public administration reform. Each of the three fundamentals is of crucial importance for the reform processes in the beneficiaries listed in Annex I and addresses key concerns of the people. Progress towards accession depends on each applicant’s respect for the Union’s values and its capacity to undertake and implement the necessary reforms to align its political, institutional, legal, administrative and economic systems with the rules, standards, policies and practices of the Union.</p>

Actions under IPA III are expected to contribute 18 % of the overall financial envelope of IPA III to climate objectives, with the objective of increasing this percentage to 20 % by 2027. Relevant actions are to be identified during the preparation and implementation of IPA III, and the overall contribution from IPA III should be considered in the relevant evaluations and review processes.</p>

In order to achieve those objectives, in addition to actions in which climate is one of the main objectives, actions under IPA III should, whenever possible, mainstream environmental sustainability and climate change objectives across all sectors, with particular attention to environmental protection and tackling cross-border pollution, and should pursue green growth in national and local strategies, including supporting sustainability criteria in public procurement. Actions under IPA III should be consistent with the principle of ‘do no harm’ and should comply with Union taxonomy to the extent possible, in particular to ensure the sustainability of investments in the Western Balkans and Turkey.</p>

Reconciling the principle of predictability with the need to react rapidly to new needs consequently means adapting the financial implementation of the programmes. To increase the ability of the Union to respond to unforeseen needs, while respecting the principle that the Union budget is set annually, this Regulation should preserve the flexibility allowed under the Financial Regulation to other policies, namely carry-overs and re-commitments of committed funds, while adhering to the goals and objectives laid down in this Regulation. This will ensure the efficient use of Union funds, both for Union citizens and for the beneficiaries listed in Annex I, thereby maximising the Union funds available for the Union’s external action interventions.</p>
