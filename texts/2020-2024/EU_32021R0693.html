This will have profound and direct implications for political, social, cultural and economic life in the Union. As part of the new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, the Justice Programme (the ‘Programme’) in line with the 2014–2020 Justice Programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1382/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2021156EN.01002101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2021156EN.01002101-E0004"

That includes a vibrant and empowered civil society as a key stakeholder, encouraging people’s democratic, civic and social participation and cultivating the rich diversity of European society on the basis of our common values, history and memory.

Respect for and promotion of the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy within the Union are prerequisites for upholding all rights and obligations enshrined in the Treaties, and for building people’s trust in the Union. The way in which the rule of law is implemented in the Member States plays a vital role in ensuring mutual trust among Member States and between their legal systems. To that end, the Union should adopt measures to develop judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. Respect for fundamental rights as well as for common principles and values, such as non-discrimination and equal treatment on the basis of any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter, in addition to solidarity, effective access to justice for all, the rule of law, democracy and a well-functioning independent judicial system, should be ensured and fostered at all levels as a European area of justice is further developed.</p>

Among other measures, a flexible and effective Justice Programme is crucial in order to facilitate the planning and implementation of those goals. The Programme should be implemented in a user-friendly way, for example through a user-friendly application and reporting procedure, and it should aim at balanced geographical coverage. Particular attention should be paid to the accessibility of the Programme for all types of beneficiary. Within the financial envelope for the Programme, a certain flexibility in the allocation of the funds among specific objectives should be preserved. The flexibility margin should be allocated, as a priority, to actions which support the promotion of the rule of law.</p>

Mutual recognition requires a high level of mutual trust among Member States. Measures to approximate the laws of the Member States in several areas have already been adopted in order to facilitate mutual recognition and foster mutual trust. A well-functioning area of justice, where obstacles to cross-border judicial proceedings and to access to justice in cross-border situations are eliminated, is also of key importance in ensuring economic growth and further integration. At the same time, a properly functioning European area of justice that comprises efficient, independent and high quality national legal systems, as well as a greater degree of mutual trust, are necessary for a flourishing internal market and for upholding the common values of the Union.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Full respect for the rule of law, and the promotion thereof, are essential for a high level of mutual trust in the area of justice and home affairs, and in particular for effective judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, which is based on mutual recognition. The rule of law is one of the common values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, and the principle of effective judicial protection provided for in Article 19(1) TEU and Article 47 of the Charter is a concrete expression of the rule of law. Promoting the rule of law by supporting efforts to improve the independence, transparency, accountability, quality and efficiency of national justice systems enhances mutual trust, which is indispensable for judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. Judicial independence and impartiality form part of the essence of the right to a fair trial and are key for the protection of European values. Furthermore, having efficient justice systems with reasonable time limits for proceedings serves legal certainty for all parties concerned.</p>

The provision of training to justice professionals is an important tool in developing a common understanding of how best to implement and uphold the rule of law and fundamental rights. It contributes to the building of the European area of justice by creating a common judicial culture among justice professionals of the Member States. It is essential to ensure the non-discriminatory, correct, coherent and consistent application of law in the Union and mutual trust and understanding between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings. The training activities supported by the Programme should be based on sound assessment of training needs, use state-of-the-art training methodology, include cross-border events involving justice professionals from different Member States, comprise active learning and networking elements and be sustainable. Such activities should include training on legal terminology, civil and criminal law, and fundamental rights, and on mutual recognition as well as procedural safeguards. Such activities should also include training courses for judges, lawyers and prosecutors in relation to the challenges and obstacles experienced by people who frequently face discrimination or are in a vulnerable situation, such as women, children, minorities, LGBTIQ persons, persons with disabilities, and victims of gender-based violence, domestic violence or violence in intimate relationships, and other forms of interpersonal violence. Such training courses should be organised with the direct involvement of organisations representing or supporting such persons and, where possible, the involvement of such persons. Taking into account the fact that women are under-represented in senior positions within the judiciary, female judges, female prosecutors and women in other legal professions should be encouraged to participate in the training activities.</p>
