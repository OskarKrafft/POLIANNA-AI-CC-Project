Those values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail. Article 3 TEU further specifies that the Union’s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples and that it is to respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and to ensure that Europe’s cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.

Provision should therefore be made in the general budget of the Union for a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, comprising the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme and the Justice Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/693 of the European Parliament and the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2021156EN.01000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2021156EN.01000101-E0004"

This will have profound and direct implications for political, social, cultural and economic life in the Union. As part of the new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, the Justice Programme, in line with the 2014–2020 Justice Programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1382/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc5-L_2021156EN.01000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_2021156EN.01000101-E0005"

European citizenship and European identity should be developed and advanced by encouraging citizens’ understanding of the policy-making process, and by promoting civic engagement in the actions of the Union. Furthermore, bringing citizens together through town-twinning projects and networks of towns and supporting civil society organisations at local, regional, national and transnational level in the areas covered by the Programme will contribute to increasing citizens’ engagement in society and ultimately to their active involvement in the democratic life of the Union. At the same time, supporting activities that promote mutual understanding, intercultural dialogue, cultural and linguistic diversity, social inclusion and respect for others fosters a sense of belonging to the Union and of a common citizenship under a European identity, based on a shared understanding of our common European values, culture, history and heritage. The promotion of a greater sense of belonging to the Union and of Union values is particularly important among citizens of its outermost regions because of their remoteness and distance from continental Europe.</p>

Remembrance activities should reflect on the causes of totalitarian regimes in Europe’s modern history, in particular Nazism, which led to the Holocaust; fascism; Stalinism and totalitarian communist regimes, and should commemorate the victims of their crimes. They should also encompass activities concerning other defining moments and reference points in recent European history. The relevance of historical, social, cultural and intercultural factors should also be taken into account in order to create a European identity based on common values and a sense of common belonging.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Gender equality is a fundamental value and an objective of the Union. Yet overall progress on gender equality has been stagnating. Discrimination against and unequal treatment of women and girls, as well as various forms of violence against them, violate their fundamental rights and prevent their full political, social and economic participation in society. In addition, the existence of political, structural and cultural barriers hinders the achievement of real gender equality. The promotion of gender equality and gender mainstreaming in all activities of the Union is therefore a core task for the Union and a driver for economic growth and social development, and should be supported by the Programme. Actively tackling stereotypes and addressing silent and intersectional discrimination are of particular importance. Equal access to work, equal participation in the labour market and the elimination of barriers to career progression in all sectors, for example the judiciary and sectors related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, are pillars of gender equality. Focus should also be placed on work-life balance and on the equal sharing between women and men of unpaid household tasks and care for children, the elderly and other dependents, as these are matters which are intrinsically related to the achievement of equal economic independence and participation, and to the achievement of equality between women and men.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Gender-based violence and violence against groups at risk (children, young persons and other groups at risk such as LGBTIQ persons, and persons with disabilities) constitute a serious violation of fundamental rights and persist throughout the Union, in all social and economic contexts, with serious repercussions for victims’ physical, mental and psychological health and for society as a whole. Gender-based violence and harassment in both the domestic and public spheres affect women most significantly. Combating such violence and harassment is therefore a key action in promoting gender equality. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention) defines violence against women as all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Combating gender-based violence requires a multi-dimensional approach and includes addressing its legal, economic, educational and health aspects. There is also a need to actively tackle gender stereotypes from an early age, as well as all forms of hate speech and online violence. In this context, it remains essential to support women’s rights organisations and other actors working in this area. Children, young persons and other groups at risk, such as LGBTIQ persons and persons with disabilities, are also at an increased risk of being subject to violence, particularly within the settings of family and intimate relationships.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Action should be taken to promote the rights of persons at risk – in particular the rights of children, including those orphaned, whether as a result of domestic crimes or otherwise, and other particularly vulnerable groups of children – and to contribute to their protection and ensure their rights to development and dignity. Combating all forms of violence, in particular gender-based violence, promoting its prevention, and protecting and supporting its victims are Union priorities which help individuals enjoy their fundamental rights and contribute to gender equality. Those priorities should be supported by the Programme. The importance of granting funding under the Programme to civil society organisations promoting gender equality, combating gender-based violence and promoting women’s rights, including sexual and reproductive health and rights and the rights of LGBTIQ persons, in all Member States is emphasised. All those activities seek to promote key values of the Union and ought therefore to be supported throughout the Union, without exception.</p>

In particular, Daphne funding to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims has, since its launch in 1997, been a genuine success, in terms of both its popularity with stakeholders (public authorities, academic institutions and non-governmental organisations) and the effectiveness of the projects funded. The Daphne programme has funded projects to raise awareness, to provide support services to victims and to support the activities of civil society organisations working on the ground. It has addressed all forms of violence, including domestic violence, sexual violence, trafficking in human beings, stalking, and harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation, as well as newly emerging forms of violence, such as cyber-bullying and online harassment. Considering the still alarming number of victims of gender-based violence, it is important to continue all these actions with an independent budget allocation for the activities implementing the specific objective of preventing and combating all forms of gender-based violence under Daphne, and to take into due consideration in the implementation of the Programme the results and lessons learned from them.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of the Union. Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Non-discrimination is also enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter. The specific features of diverse forms of discrimination, including direct, indirect and structural discrimination, should be taken into account and appropriate action should be developed in parallel to prevent and combat discrimination on one or more grounds. The Programme should support actions to prevent and combat all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, afrophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-Gypsyism, anti-Muslim hatred, and allforms of intolerance, including homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, interphobia and intolerance based on gender identity, both online and offline, as well as intolerance of persons belonging to minorities, taking into account multiple discrimination. In that context, particular attention should also be devoted to preventing and combating all forms of violence, hatred, segregation and stigmatisation, as well as to combating bullying, harassment and intolerant treatment. The Programme should be implemented in a mutually reinforcing manner with other Union activities that have the same objectives, in particular those referred to in Commission communication of 5 April 2011 entitled ‘An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020’ and in Council Recommendation of 9 December 2013 on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States <a id="ntc9-L_2021156EN.01000101-E0009" href="#ntr9-L_2021156EN.01000101-E0009"

The Programme should be implemented in a user-friendly way, for example through a user-friendly application and reporting procedure. Particular attention should be paid to the accessibility of the Programme for civil society organisations at local, regional, national and transnational level, including local grassroots civil society organisations, as well as to the capacity of beneficiaries.
