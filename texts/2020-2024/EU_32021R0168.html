In addition, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom announced in 2017 that it would not persuade or compel panel banks to submit to LIBOR beyond the end of 2021. Subsequent announcements by the FCA and the administrator of LIBOR have made it clear that LIBOR is likely to be wound down in most of the tenors and currencies for which it is calculated by the end of 2021, with other tenors and currencies of LIBOR to follow in 2023. The cessation or wind-down of LIBOR might result in negative consequences that significantly disrupt the functioning of financial markets in the Union. There is a vast number of contracts that affect economic operators in the Union and that pertain to debt, loans, term deposits, securities and derivatives that all reference LIBOR, that mature later than 31 December 2021 and that do not contain sufficiently robust fallback provisions to cover the cessation or the wind-down of LIBOR as calculated for the relevant currency or some of its tenors.

Along with the magnitude of the exposure to such benchmarks of existing contracts, and financial instruments as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, the increased risk of contract frustration and litigation could significantly disrupt the functioning of financial markets. In those extraordinary circumstances and in order to address the systemic risks involved, it is necessary to establish a harmonised approach to deal with the cessation or wind-down of certain benchmarks with systemic relevance for the Union.

If possible, those contingency plans should identify one or more potential replacements for benchmarks. As the experience with LIBOR has shown, it is important that contingency plans are prepared for cases in which a benchmark materially changes or ceases to be provided. Competent authorities should monitor whether that obligation is complied with, and it should be possible for them to carry out random checks on compliance. Therefore, supervised entities should keep their contingency plans, and any updates to them, readily available so that they can forward them, upon request, to the competent authorities without delay.</p>

Many entities use such benchmarks but do not qualify as supervised entities. Consequently, the parties to such contracts and holders of such financial instruments would not benefit from a replacement for a benchmark. In order to mitigate the potential impacts on market integrity and financial stability as much as possible and to provide for protection against legal uncertainty, the mandate of the Commission to designate a replacement for a benchmark should apply to any contract and any financial instrument as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU that is subject to the law of a Member State. In addition, the designated replacement for a benchmark should apply to contracts that are subject to the law of a third country but all the parties to which are established in the Union, in cases where the contract meets the requirements of this Regulation and where the law of that third country does not provide for an orderly wind-down of a benchmark. This extension of the scope should be without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 that are not amended by this Regulation.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Benchmarks and their contractually agreed fallback rates might over time diverge significantly and unexpectedly, and as a consequence, they might no longer represent the same underlying economic reality or lead to commercially unacceptable results. Such cases could include the significant widening of the spread between the benchmark and the contractually agreed fallback rate over time or situations where the contractually agreed fallback provision changes the basis of the benchmark from a variable rate to a fixed rate. Since this issue might arise in a number of Member States, and since contracting parties from different Member States would frequently also be affected in such cases, it should be addressed in a harmonised way in order to avoid legal uncertainty, excessive litigation and, as a consequence, possible significant negative effects on the internal market or repercussions for the financial stability in individual Member States or the Union. Accordingly, the replacement for a benchmark that is established by the implementing act should under certain preconditions serve as a replacement when relevant national authorities, for example macro-prudential authorities, systemic risk councils or central banks, have established that the originally agreed fallback provision no longer reflects the economic reality that the benchmark in cessation was intended to measure or that such a provision could pose a threat to financial stability. The relevant national authorities should undertake an assessment when they are made aware of the potential unsuitability of a commonly used fallback provision by one or more potentially interested parties. Such assessment should, however, not be performed on a contract-by-contract basis. The relevant national authorities involved should inform the Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of that assessment.</p>

However, limited progress has been made in that regard. The scope of the regulatory regime for financial benchmarks differs significantly between the Union and third countries. Therefore, to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and the availability of third-country benchmarks for use in the Union after the end of the transitional period, the Commission should, by 15 June 2023, present a report on the review of the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, as amended by this Regulation, with particular regard to its effect on the use of third-country benchmarks in the Union. In that report the Commission should analyse the consequences of the far-reaching scope of such regulation for Union administrators and users of benchmarks also with respect to the continued use of third-country benchmarks. In particular, the Commission should assess whether there is a need to further amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 in order to reduce its scope only to administrators of certain types of benchmarks or to administrators whose benchmarks are widely used in the Union.</p>

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">9</span>)</a> has recently been amended to provide clarity to market participants that contracts entered into or novated before the start of application of the clearing or margin requirements to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts that reference a benchmark (‘legacy contracts’) will not be subject to those requirements if those contracts are amended with regard to the benchmark they reference and if those amendments serve the sole purpose of implementing or preparing for the implementation of a replacement for a benchmark or introducing fallback provisions during the transition to a new benchmark as part of a benchmark reform. Benchmark reforms result from internationally coordinated work streams and initiatives aimed at reforming benchmarks to comply with the International Principles for Financial Benchmarks published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 requires supervised entities to produce and maintain robust written plans setting out the actions they would take in the event that any benchmark materially changes or ceases to be provided and to reflect those plans in the contractual relationship with clients. In order to facilitate compliance by market participants with those obligations and to support action by market participants to enhance the robustness of OTC derivative contracts that reference benchmarks potentially subject to reforms, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should be further amended to clarify that legacy contracts will not be subject to clearing or margin requirements if those contracts are amended for the sole purpose of replacing the benchmark they reference against the background of a benchmark reform.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">Therefore, that exception applies only to contractual amendments necessary to implement or prepare for the implementation of a replacement for a benchmark due to a benchmark reform or necessary to introduce fallback provisions in relation to a benchmark in order to enhance the robustness of the relevant contracts. Those amendments should serve to provide clarity to market participants and should not affect the scope of the clearing and margin obligations in relation to amendments of OTC derivative contracts for other purposes or in relation to replacements or novations such as changes of counterparties.</p>
