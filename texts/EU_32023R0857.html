That commitment has been reinforced with the adoption under the UNFCCC of the Glasgow Climate Pact on 13 November 2021, in which the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, recognises that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1,5 °C compared with 2 °C, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 °C.</p>

It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, that transition has gender equality aspects as well as a particular impact on some disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, such as older people, persons with disabilities and persons with a minority racial or ethnic background.

The possibility of transferring annual emission allocations promotes cooperation between Member States, allowing them to achieve their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets cost-effectively, while preserving environmental integrity.

Moreover, in order to facilitate the exchange of information on intended transfers, Member States are invited to continually update the relevant information. A summary of the information received is compiled by the Commission and made available in a timely manner in electronic form.

It is therefore appropriate to set a new deadline by which it is possible for those Member States to notify the Commission of an intention to make use or further use of that flexibility. In addition, given the particular structure of Malta’s economy, the national greenhouse gas emission reduction target of that Member State based on gross domestic product per capita is significantly above its cost-effective reduction potential.
