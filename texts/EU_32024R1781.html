It sets the ambitious objective of ensuring that the Union becomes the first climate neutral continent by 2050. It recognises the advantages of investing in the Union’s competitive sustainability by building a fairer, greener and more digital Europe. Products have a pivotal role to play in this green transition. Underlining that current production processes and consumption patterns remain too linear and dependent on a throughput of new materials extracted, traded and processed into goods that are finally disposed of as waste or emissions, the European Green Deal emphasises the urgent need to transition to a circular economy model and stresses the significant progress that remains to be made. It also identifies energy efficiency as a priority for the decarbonisation of the energy sector and for reaching the climate objectives in 2030 and 2050.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To accelerate the transition to a circular economy model, the Commission designed a future-oriented agenda in its communication of 11 March 2020 on a new Circular Economy Action Plan for a cleaner and more competitive Europe (CEAP), with the objective of making the regulatory framework fit for a sustainable future. The CEAP underlines that, ‘for citizens, the circular economy will provide high-quality, functional and safe products, which are efficient and affordable, last longer and are designed for reuse, repair, and high-quality recycling’. As set out in CEAP, there is currently no comprehensive set of requirements to ensure that all products placed on the Union market become increasingly sustainable and stand the test of circularity. In particular, product design does not sufficiently promote sustainability over the whole life cycle. As a result, products are being replaced frequently, involving significant energy and resource use in order to produce and distribute new products and dispose of old ones. It is still too difficult for economic operators and citizens to make sustainable choices in relation to products, given that relevant information and affordable options to do so are lacking. This leads to missed opportunities for sustainability and for value-retaining operations, limited demand for secondary materials and obstacles to the adoption of circular business models.</p>

It echoes the European Green Deal in pointing to the leading role that Europe’s industry must play in that, by reducing its carbon footprint and material footprint and embedding circularity across the economy, and underlines the need to move away from traditional models, and revolutionise the way we design, make, use and dispose of products, as well as the need for a secure supply of raw materials. Recycling and the use of secondary raw materials will help reduce the Union's dependency. The communication of the Commission of 5 May 2021 on Updating the 2020 New Industrial Strategy: Building a stronger Single Market for Europe’s recovery reinforces the main messages of the 2020 Strategy and focuses on the lessons from the COVID-19 crisis, including the need to foster resilience.</p>

In 2021, the Commission adopted the Fit for 55 Package to make the Union’s climate and energy policies fit for achieving these objectives. To do so, in line with the energy efficiency first principle enshrined in Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc9-L_202401781EN.000101-E0009" href="#ntr9-L_202401781EN.000101-E0009"

Product requirements established under this Regulation will play a significant role in the reaching of that target by substantially decreasing products’ energy footprint. Those energy efficiency requirements will also reduce consumer vulnerability to energy price increases. As recognised by the Paris Agreement, improving the sustainability of consumption and production will also play an important role in addressing climate change.</p>

The European Green Deal also calls for the Union to better monitor, report, prevent and remedy air, water, soil and consumer products pollution. This means that chemicals, materials and products have to be safe and sustainable by design and during their life cycle, leading to non-toxic material cycles as set out in the communication of the Commission of 12 May 2021 on an EU Action Plan: ‘Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil’ and the communication of the Commission of 14 October 2020 on a Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability — Towards a Toxic-Free Environment, which calls for the zero pollution ambition in production and consumption to be embraced. In addition, both the European Green Deal and the CEAP recognise that the Union internal market provides a critical mass that is able to influence global standards on product sustainability and product design. This Regulation will therefore play a significant role towards achieving several targets established under the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, both inside and outside the Union, in particular targets under Sustainable Development Goal 12 (‘Responsible consumption and production’).</p>

Digital content that is an integral part of a physical product is to be included in the scope. This should allow the Commission to take into account the broadest range of products possible when prioritising the setting of ecodesign requirements and thereby maximise their effectiveness. Where needed, specific exemptions should be provided for when setting ecodesign requirements, in particular where ecodesign requirements are not necessary to contribute to the environmental sustainability of specific products, or, for example, for products with a particular use, products with a particular purpose that could not be fulfilled when complying with ecodesign requirements or products produced in very small quantities, or taking into account the specificity and size of the product’s market. In addition, this Regulation should not apply to products for which it is already clear that ecodesign requirements would not be suitable or where other frameworks provide for the setting of such requirements.

                           <p class="oj-normal">When setting ecodesign requirements, the Commission should take into account the nature and purpose of the products concerned as well as the characteristics of the relevant markets. For example, defence equipment needs to be able to operate under specific and sometimes harsh conditions, and that needs to be considered when setting ecodesign requirements. Certain information on defence equipment should not be disclosed and should be protected. Ecodesign requirements should thus not be set for products with the sole purpose of serving defence or national security. It is important that for other military or sensitive equipment ecodesign requirements take into account the security needs and the characteristics of the defence market, as defined in Directive 2009/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc22-L_202401781EN.000101-E0022" href="#ntr22-L_202401781EN.000101-E0022"

As space technologies operate in extreme conditions, any ecodesign requirements for space products should balance sustainability considerations with resilience and expected performance. Furthermore, for medical devices as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc23-L_202401781EN.000101-E0023" href="#ntr23-L_202401781EN.000101-E0023"

In doing so, the Commission should take account of its experience in assessing the setting of requirements under Directive 2009/125/EC and the continuing efforts to develop and improve science-based assessment tools, including the update of the methodology for ecodesign of energy-related products, and the Product Environmental Footprint method set out in Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 <a id="ntc28-L_202401781EN.000101-E0028" href="#ntr28-L_202401781EN.000101-E0028"

Information related to environmental life cycle indicators, such as the carbon footprint, should be calculated taking into consideration internationally established methods that are already implemented in Union law. It is also important to take into consideration scientific methods recommended by international and European standardisation organisations. In particular, when it comes to the modelling of the energy used in manufacturing processes, particular consideration should be given to modelling of the energy mix that would also take into account issues such as power purchase agreements, guarantees of origin and own electricity production. New approaches might also be needed for the preparation of mandatory public procurement criteria and for bans on the destruction of unsold consumer products.</p>

Such requirements could include minimum or maximum levels of performance in relation to the product parameter, non-quantitative requirements that aim to improve performance in relation to the product parameter, or requirements related to a product’s functional performance to ensure that the selected performance requirements do not negatively impact the ability of the product to perform the function for which it was designed and marketed. Regarding minimum or maximum levels, they could for example take the form of a limit on energy consumption in the use phase or on the quantities of a given material incorporated in the product, a requirement for minimum quantities of recycled content, or a limit on a specific environmental impact category or on an aggregation of all relevant environmental impacts. An example of a non-quantitative requirement is the prohibition of a specific technical solution that is detrimental to product repairability. Performance requirements will be used to ensure the removal of the worst performing products from the market and to gradually move to the best performing products where that is necessary to contribute to the environmental sustainability objectives of this Regulation. Performance requirements could also concern resource use, including requirements related to the usage of renewable resources or materials with bio-based content in the product and address the release of nano- and microplastics. In envisaging a combination of requirements, the Commission should assess them as a whole and identify the combination of requirements that delivers the highest environmental sustainability benefits.</p>

Where a substance has already been established as being a substance that hinders circularity for one product group, this can be an indication that it also hinders circularity for other product groups.

They should require the manufacturer to make available information on the product’s performance in relation to a selected product parameter or other information that may influence the way the product is handled by parties other than the manufacturer in order to improve performance in relation to such a parameter. Such information requirements should be set either in addition to, or instead of, performance requirements concerning the same product parameter, as appropriate. It is important that the Commission duly justify its decision to only lay down information requirements instead of performance requirements. Where a delegated act includes information requirements, it should indicate the method for making the required information available and easily accessible, such as its inclusion on a free-access website, in a digital product passport or on a product label. Essential information relating to the health, safety and rights of end users should always be provided to consumers by physical means and be accessible through a data carrier included on the product. Information requirements are necessary to lead to the behavioural change needed to ensure that the environmental sustainability objectives of this Regulation are achieved. Information relevant for making an informed purchasing decision should be provided to the consumer prior to the purchase of the product. By providing appropriate means for purchasers and public authorities to compare products on the basis of their environmental sustainability, information requirements are expected to drive consumers and public authorities towards more sustainable choices. Information requirements should also contribute to improved collection rates by Member States for relevant product groups, in particular for those for which a significant reuse and refurbishment potential exists, such as mobile phones for which the collection rate in Member States does not exceed 5 %, for example by facilitating information on take-back schemes through financial incentives and deposit-refund systems, data privacy guarantees, databases of drop-off points, and personalised end-of-life information, via a digital product passport, on the value of the product and on best practices about proper disposal.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Information on the presence of substances of concern in products is a key element to identify and promote products that are sustainable. The chemical composition of products largely determines their functionalities and impacts, as well as the possibility for their reuse or for recovery once they become waste. The Commission’s communication of 14 October 2020‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability Towards a Toxic-Free Environment’ calls for the presence of substances of concern in products to be minimised, and the availability of information on chemical content and safe use to be ensured, by introducing information requirements and tracking the presence of substances of concern throughout the life cycle of materials and products. Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and other existing chemicals law such as Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 already ensure communication on hazards to health or the environment posed by certain substances of concern on their own or in a mixture. Users of substances and mixtures should also be provided with pertinent information. Furthermore, users of products other than substances or mixtures, and managers of waste from such products, should also receive relevant information, including information primarily related to the hazards of chemicals to health or the environment. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for the setting of requirements related to the tracking and communication of sustainability information, including the presence of substances of concern in products throughout their life cycle, also with a view to the decontamination and recovery of such products when they become waste. Such a framework should aim to progressively cover the substances of concern in all products listed in working plans to be adopted by the Commission. Such requirements concerning the tracking of substances of concern should be included by default where an information requirement is to be set under this Regulation, except when such an information requirement is part of horizontal ecodesign requirements. In order to take into account the criteria to be met by ecodesign requirements, and in particular to avoid a disproportionate administrative burden for economic operators, the Commission should be able, as appropriate for the product group concerned, to set thresholds on the concentration of substances in the product or relevant components triggering the tracking requirement, set differentiated application deadlines and, in duly justified cases, provide derogations from the tracking requirement. When setting the detail of information required and thresholds, the Commission should take into consideration existing information requirements and thresholds under Union law, in particular under Regulations (EC) No 1907/2006 and (EC) No 1272/2008, and other sectoral product legislation. A derogation based on technical feasibility could apply in cases where the presence of a substance in a product cannot be verified with the current available technologies.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The information requirements set under this Regulation should include the requirement to make a digital product passport available. The digital product passport is an important tool for making information available to actors along the entire value chain and the availability of a digital product passport is expected to significantly enhance end-to-end traceability of a product throughout its value chain. Among other things, the digital product passport is expected to help customers make informed choices by improving their access to relevant information, allow economic operators, namely manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers, distributors, dealers and fulfilment service providers, and other value chain actors, such as customers, professional repairers, independent operators, refurbishers, remanufacturers, recyclers, market surveillance and customs authorities, civil society organisations, researchers, trade unions, and the Commission, or any organisation acting on their behalf, to access, introduce or update relevant data, and enable competent national authorities to perform their duties, without endangering the protection of confidential business information. To that end, it is important that the digital product passport be user-friendly and that the data contained therein be accurate, complete and up to date. The digital product passport should, where necessary, be complemented by non-digital forms of transmitting information, such as information in the product manual or on a label. In addition, it should be possible for the digital product passport to be used for providing information concerning the relevant product group pursuant to other Union law.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">To take account of the nature of the product and its market, the information to be included in the digital product passport should be carefully examined on a case-by-case basis when preparing product-specific rules. To optimise access to the resulting data while also protecting intellectual property rights, the digital product passport needs to be designed and implemented in a manner that allows differentiated access to the data in the digital product passport depending on the type of data and the typology of stakeholders. Similarly, to avoid costs for companies and for the public that are disproportionate to the wider benefits, the digital product passport should be specific to the item, batch or product model, depending on, for example, the complexity of the value chain, the size, nature or impacts of the products considered. The impact assessments carried out when preparing the delegated acts setting ecodesign requirements should analyse the costs and benefits of setting information requirements through digital product passports at model, batch or item level. The term ‘model’ usually refers to a version of a product of which all units share the same technical characteristics relevant for the ecodesign requirements and the same model identifier, the term ‘batch’ usually refers to a subset of a specific model composed of all products produced in a specific manufacturing plant at a specific moment in time and the term ‘item’ usually refers to a single unit of a model. The impact assessment should also, to the extent that the digital product passport relies on standards which are not free of charge, consider whether such reliance is appropriate and how disproportionate costs for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can be avoided.</p>

Similarly, in order to prevent an unnecessary administrative burden for economic operators, the Commission should be allowed to exempt product groups from the digital product passport requirements in the event that other Union law already includes a system for the digital provision of product information allowing actors along the value chain to access relevant product information and facilitating the verification of product compliance by competent national authorities.

In order to ensure interoperability, the data carrier, the unique operator identifier and the unique facility identifier enabling traceability should be issued in accordance with internationally recognised standards. The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend this Regulation by replacing or adding standards in accordance with which the data carrier, the unique operator identifier and the unique facility identifier can be issued, in light of technical or scientific progress. This should ensure that the data contained in the digital product passport can be recorded and transmitted by all the economic operators, as well as guarantee the compatibility of unique identifiers with external components such as scanning devices.

Technical specifications should be established to ensure the effective implementation of those essential requirements, either in the form of harmonised standards for which the references have been published in the <span class="oj-italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span> or, as a fall-back option, common specifications adopted by the Commission via implementing acts. The technical design should ensure that the digital product passport carries data in a secure way, respecting privacy rules. It is necessary that the digital product passport be developed in an open dialogue with international partners, in order to take account of their views when developing technical specifications and to ensure that they help remove trade barriers for greener products with extended life cycles and circularity, lowering costs for sustainable investments, marketing, compliance, and supporting innovation. In order to allow for their effective implementation, it is important that technical specifications and requirements related to traceability across the value chain be developed, to the extent possible, on the basis of a consensual approach and of the involvement, buy-in, and effective collaboration of a diverse set of actors, including standardisation bodies, industry associations, start-ups, consumer organisations, experts, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international partners, including developing economies.</p>

Based on the process followed for prioritisation under Directive 2009/125/EC, the Commission should adopt a working plan covering at least three years and laying down a list of product groups for which it intends to adopt delegated acts, as well as the product aspects for which it intends to adopt delegated acts of horizontal application. The Commission should base its prioritisation on a set of criteria pertaining in particular to the delegated acts’ potential contribution to achieving the Union’s climate, environmental and energy objectives, and their potential for the improvement of the product aspects selected, without leading to disproportionate costs for the public and economic operators. Member States and stakeholders should also be consulted through an Ecodesign Forum to be established by the Commission. Due to the complementarities between this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 for energy-related products, the timelines for the working plan under this Regulation and the working plan provided for under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 should be aligned. When prioritising intermediate products, the Commission should also take into account the consequences for final products that are made from such intermediate products. Considering their importance for meeting the Union’s energy objectives, the working plan should include an adequate share of actions related to energy-related products. Vehicles as referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 are already subject to comprehensive provisions, including specific environmental requirements, and should therefore not be prioritised for the setting of ecodesign requirements. For the first working plan, the Commission should prioritise iron, steel, aluminium, textiles, in particular garments and footwear, furniture, including mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, chemicals, information and communication technology products and other electronics, and energy-related products for which ecodesign requirements are to be set for the first time or for which existing measures adopted pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC are to be reviewed under this Regulation. The Commission should provide an appropriate justification in the event that it decides to modify that list.</p>

In addition, when formulating working plans, the Commission should take into account that, in continuation of current practice, the construction products Regulation, gives prevalence to sustainability requirements set under this Regulation for energy-related products that are also construction products. This should be the case for instance for heaters, boilers, heat pumps, water and space heating appliances, fans, cooling and ventilating systems and photovoltaic products, excluding building-integrated photovoltaic panels. The construction products Regulation can apply to those products in a complementary manner where needed, mainly in relation to safety aspects, also taking account of other Union law on products such as on gas appliances, low voltage equipment and machinery.</p>

Within the Ecodesign Forum, the Commission should establish a Member States Expert Group, which should contribute to preparing new ecodesign requirements, to assessing self-regulation measures, to the exchange of information and best practices between Member States on measures to enhance compliance with this Regulation, such as education and information campaigns or provision of support to SMEs, as well as to setting priorities.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">In order to encourage self-regulation as a valid alternative to regulatory approaches, this Regulation should, building on Directive 2009/125/EC, include the possibility for industry to submit self-regulation measures for products which are not included in the working plan. Self-regulation measures should be aligned with the objectives of this Regulation. The Commission should assess the self-regulation measures proposed by industry, along with the information and evidence submitted by the signatories, in light of, inter alia, the international trade commitments of the Union and the need to ensure consistency with Union law. It is also appropriate, for instance in view of relevant market or technological developments within the product group concerned, that the Commission be able to request a revised version of the self-regulation measure whenever considered necessary. Once a self-regulation measure is listed in an implementing act containing a list of self-regulation measures which fulfil the criteria set in this Regulation, there is a legitimate expectation for economic operators that the Commission will first consider the content of such a measure before proposing a delegated act setting ecodesign requirements for the specific product group concerned. However, the Commission should be able to adopt ecodesign requirements also applying to some or all of the products covered by a recognised self-regulation measure for the product aspects not addressed by that self-regulation measure. Where the Commission considers that a self-regulation measure no longer fulfils the criteria set in this Regulation, it should remove it from that implementing act. Consequently, it should be possible to set ecodesign requirements for the product groups previously addressed by that self-regulation measure.</p>

The Commission should, when preparing ecodesign requirements, take into account their impact on SMEs, in particular on microenterprises, active in the relevant product sector. The Member States and the Commission should, in their respective areas of responsibility, provide adequate information including guidance, provide targeted and specialised training, and provide specific assistance and support, including financial support, to SMEs active in the manufacturing of products for which ecodesign requirements are set. Those actions are particularly important for product groups where the presence of SMEs is relevant. The Commission should, where appropriate, support the calculation of the product environmental footprint by providing digital tools, such as tools for life cycle assessment calculation, and support the implementation of the digital product passport. It is important that the Commission provide financial support to SMEs’ representatives, in particular those of microenterprises, to enable their effective participation in the Ecodesign Forum and that it provide easily accessible information to SMEs on available financial support and programmes. Member States’ actions should be taken in accordance with applicable State aid rules. While developing and implementing those actions, Member States can rely on the support provided by Union programmes and initiatives for SMEs.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">The destruction of unsold consumer products, such as textiles and footwear, by economic operators is becoming a widespread environmental problem across the Union, in particular due to the rapid growth of online sales. It amounts to a loss of valuable economic resources as goods are produced, transported and afterwards destroyed without ever being used for their intended purpose. It is therefore necessary, in the interest of environmental protection, that this Regulation establish a framework to prevent the destruction of unsold products primarily intended for consumers, including products that have not been offered for sale or products returned by consumers on the basis of their right of withdrawal as laid down by Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc41-L_202401781EN.000101-E0041" href="#ntr41-L_202401781EN.000101-E0041"
                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">41</span>)</a> or during any longer withdrawal period provided by the trader. The concept of destruction as outlined in this Regulation should cover the last three activities on the waste hierarchy, namely recycling, other recovery and disposal. Preparation for reuse, including refurbishment and remanufacturing, should not be considered destruction. Preventing destruction will reduce the environmental impact of those products by reducing the generation of waste and by disincentivising overproduction. Economic operators should take the measures necessary to prevent the need to destroy unsold consumer products. In addition, given that several Member States have introduced national legislation on the destruction of unsold consumer products thereby creating market distortions, harmonised rules on the destruction of unsold consumer products are necessary to ensure that distributors, retailers and other economic operators are subject to the same rules and incentives across Member States.</p>

Where applicable, they should also have the possibility of including that information in their management reports pursuant to Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc42-L_202401781EN.000101-E0042" href="#ntr42-L_202401781EN.000101-E0042"

Newly produced but unsold textiles and especially clothing are among the items reportedly being destroyed. Clothing should be given a higher value, and be worn longer and cared for more, than is the case in today’s fast fashion culture. From a circular economy perspective, such wasting of valuable resources is in clear contradiction to the objectives of this Regulation. It is therefore justified to prohibit the destruction of unsold consumer apparel and clothing accessories as well as footwear.</p>

Given the wide range of products that may potentially be destroyed without ever being sold or used, it is necessary that the Commission assess the extent to which the destruction of such products takes place in practice, taking into account the information made available by economic operators where appropriate. To ensure that this obligation is proportionate, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by setting out specific derogations under which destroying unsold consumer products can still be permitted, for instance in view of health and safety concerns. To monitor the effectiveness of such prohibition and to disincentivise circumvention, economic operators should be required to disclose the number and weight of unsold consumer products discarded, the reasons for discarding those products and applicable derogations. Finally, to avoid any undue administrative burden for micro and small enterprises, they should be exempted from the prohibition of destruction of specific products set in this Regulation. That prohibition should start applying to medium-sized enterprises six years after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, where there is reasonable evidence that micro and small enterprises could be used to circumvent that prohibition, the Commission should be able to require in delegated acts that the prohibition of destruction of unsold consumer products or the disclosure obligation apply to those enterprises for specific products.</p>

For the purposes of Article 31(3) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, providers of online marketplaces should make use, inter alia, of the information available in the public user interface of the information and communication system referred to in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. Providers of online marketplaces should also cooperate with market surveillance authorities to tackle illegal content related to non-compliant products. Actions within the framework of that cooperation should include the establishment of a regular and structured exchange of information on action taken by providers of online marketplaces, including the removal of product offers. Providers of online marketplaces should also grant access to their interfaces to help market surveillance authorities to identify non-compliant products sold online. Moreover, it is possible that market surveillance authorities would also need to scrape data from online marketplaces.</p>

In the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to adopt implementing acts establishing common specifications as an exceptional fall-back solution to facilitate compliance with ecodesign requirements by the manufacturer, for instance when the standardisation process is blocked due to a lack of consensus between stakeholders or where there are delays in establishing a harmonised standard and the prescribed deadline cannot be respected. Such delays could for example occur when the required quality is not reached. In addition, recourse to this solution should be possible where the Commission has restricted or withdrawn the references to relevant harmonised standards in line with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. Compliance with common specifications should also give rise to the presumption of conformity.

                           <p class="oj-normal">Public procurement amounts to 14 % of the Union’s GDP. To contribute to the objective of reaching climate neutrality, improving energy and resource efficiency and transitioning to a circular economy that protects public health and biodiversity, by ensuring that there is sufficient demand for more environmentally sustainable products, contracting authorities and contracting entities should, where appropriate, align their procurement with specific green public procurement requirements. Compared to a voluntary approach, mandatory green public procurement requirements will ensure that the leverage of public spending to boost demand for better performing products is maximised. It is important that Member States provide assistance to national contracting authorities to upskill and reskill staff in charge of green public procurement. Those green public procurement requirements should be minimum requirements, meaning that contracting authorities and contracting entities should be able to set additional and more demanding requirements. Those requirements should be transparent, objective and non-discriminatory. The public procurement procedure should be conducted by contracting authorities and contracting entities in compliance with Directives 2014/24/EU <a id="ntc51-L_202401781EN.000101-E0051" href="#ntr51-L_202401781EN.000101-E0051"

                                 >(<span class="oj-super oj-note-tag">52</span>)</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council, and applicable sectoral legislation, as well as with the Union’s international commitments, including the Government Procurement Agreement and other international agreements by which the Union is bound. Those requirements are without prejudice to the possibility for contracting authorities and contracting entities to rely on derogations or exemptions regarding public contracts set out in Union law, in particular Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU. The requirements set for specific product groups should be complied with not only when directly procuring those products in public supply contracts but also in public works or public services contracts, where those products will be used for activities constituting the subject matter of those contracts. Those requirements should be set in relation to the product aspects addressed in the delegated act regulating the products in question. As part of those requirements, the Commission might set out minimum mandatory technical specifications requiring products to comply with the best possible performance levels as set out in the relevant delegated acts, including where available with the two highest classes of performance or scores. As a result, for example, it would be mandatory for contracting authorities and contracting entities to require that the tenderers’ products meet specific carbon footprint requirements. In compliance with the public procurement framework, those minimum mandatory technical specifications should avoid artificially restricting competition and avoid favouring a specific economic operator. The Commission might also set up minimum mandatory award criteria including assigning a specific weighting, between 15 % and 30 %, to those criteria for the purpose of ensuring that they can significantly influence the choice of products in favour of those that are the most environmentally sustainable. As a result, for example, it would be mandatory for contracting authorities and contracting entities to give the recycled content of the products in question a minimum weighting between 20 % and 30 %. As a consequence, contracting authorities and contracting entities, in the specific award procedure, would have the possibility of assigning a weighting higher than 30 %, but not lower than 20 % to recycled content. Award criteria should be preferred to technical specifications when there are uncertainties about the availability or cost of the best performing products in the Union market. The Commission might also set contract performance conditions and targets according to which, for instance, contracting authorities and contracting entities should award at least 50 % of their annual procurement of certain products to those with more than 70 % of recyclable material. As a result, Member States could still set higher targets for the procurement of those products. When developing implementing acts and in particular when considering the economic feasibility for contracting authorities and contracting entities, the Commission should take into account the best possible environmental products and solutions available on the market, the effects of the requirements on competition and the fact that different contracting authorities and contracting entities in different Member States might have different budgetary capacities or other constraints such as with regard to climate conditions or network infrastructure.</p>

As part of that assessment, the Commission should consider to what extent those requirements could complement Union law, thereby addressing adverse impacts on human and social rights arising from companies’ operations and from products. The Commission should therefore carry out an evaluation within four years of the date of entry into force of this Regulation on the potential benefits of inclusion of social sustainability requirements within the scope of this Regulation. The Commission should submit to the European Parliament, to the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and to the Committee of the Regions a report on the evaluation. Where appropriate, the report should be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend this Regulation.</p>

Directive 2009/125/EC should therefore be replaced. In order to ensure legal certainty for all economic operators from the date of entry into force of this Regulation and to guarantee a level playing-field for businesses operating on the internal market, the provisions setting out transparency obligations related to the discarding of unsold consumer products, circumvention, and market surveillance should be of uniform application for all operators across the Union. Directive 2009/125/EC should therefore be replaced by a Regulation.</p>

When the provisions of this Regulation take effect, preparatory work assessing the feasibility of ecodesign requirements pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC will be at a substantially advanced stage for photovoltaic panels, space and combination heaters, water heaters, solid fuel local space heaters, air conditioners including air-to-air heat pumps and comfort fans, solid fuel boilers, air heating and cooling products, ventilation units, vacuum cleaners, cooking appliances, water pumps, industrial fans, circulators, external power supplies, computers, servers and data storage products, power transformers, professional refrigeration equipment and imaging equipment. Thanks to that preparatory work, numerous areas where energy and material can be saved have been identified, and extensive consultations of citizens and stakeholders have taken place. Restarting that preparatory work under this Regulation would considerably delay the adoption of requirements concerning energy and material savings for those products. In order to ensure that the preparatory work is not lost, it is therefore necessary to provide for transitional rules allowing implementing measures on those products to be adopted pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC by 31 December 2026. In addition, and in order to ensure the proper functioning of implementing measures adopted under Article 15 of Directive 2009/125/EC, necessary amendments addressing technical issues should be adopted if relevant in accordance with the relevant provisions of that Directive by 31 December 2030.</p>

For the same reasons, a number of provisions of Directive 2009/125/EC should continue to have full effect in the context of applying those implementing measures. This concerns in particular provisions of Directive 2009/125/EC excluding means of transport for goods or persons from its scope, establishing definitions relevant for implementing measures, setting economic operators’ responsibilities in relation to products placed on the market, specifying the details of the relevant conformity assessment procedures and the EC declaration of conformity, establishing a presumption of conformity for products which have been awarded the EU Ecolabel and enabling necessary action in relation to harmonised standards. Given the importance of ensuring the free movement of goods, banning practices illegally altering products’ performance in order to reach a more favourable result and ensuring proper enforcement of ecodesign requirements, relevant provisions of this Regulation should be applicable to energy-related products placed on the market pursuant to implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC.</p>

            <p class="oj-normal">a technical, environmental and economic analysis shall select a number of representative models of the product or products in question on the market and identify the technical options for improving the product performance in relation to the product parameters referred to in Annex I, taking into account the economic viability of the options and avoiding any significant increase of other life cycle environmental impacts, and significant loss of performance or of usefulness for consumers.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The analysis referred to in the first paragraph shall also identify, for the parameter under consideration, the best-performing products and technologies available on the market, as well as emerging technology improvements.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">The performance of products available on international markets and benchmarks set in other countries’ law shall be taken into consideration during the analysis referred to in the first paragraph as well as when setting requirements.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Based on the analysis referred to in the first paragraph, and taking into account economic and technical feasibility, including the availability of key resources and technologies, as well as the potential for improvement, levels or non-quantitative requirements shall be defined.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Any concentration limit for substances as referred to in Annex I, point (f), shall be based on a thorough analysis of the sustainability of the substances and their identified alternatives, and shall not have significant adverse effects on human health or the environment. Any performance requirement concerning substances as referred to in Annex I, point (f), shall take into consideration existing chemical safety assessments performed by the relevant Union bodies for the substances concerned, as well as safe and sustainable by design criteria for chemicals and materials developed by the Commission. Proposed concentration limits shall also consider aspects of enforceability, such as analytical detection limits.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">Where relevant, the analysis referred to in the first paragraph shall take into account the likely impacts of climate change on the product during its prospective lifetime, and the product’s potential to improve climate resilience throughout its life cycle.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">A sensitivity analysis covering the relevant factors, such as the price of energy or other resources, the cost of raw materials and necessary technologies, production costs, discount rates, and, where appropriate, external environmental costs, including avoided greenhouse gas emissions, shall be carried out.</p>
            <p class="oj-normal">For the development of the analysis referred to in the first subparagraph, relevant information available in the framework of other Union activities, including, among others, existing sectoral roadmaps as referred to in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, shall be taken into account and shall include technical information used as a basis for or derived from Regulation (EC) No 66/2010, Directive 2010/75/EU, technical screening criteria adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and EU green public procurement criteria.</p>
